 yes      _comma_      it s important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement  .  to make full use of the network settlement service and take advantage of the whole banking system      _comma_      we provide internal fund transfers      _comma_      account inquiry      _comma_      agency clearing to name but a few  .  
 so   _comma_   do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ? 
 yes   _comma_   and it s extremely simple  .  all you need to do is make a network settlement agreement with us  .  
dear    _comma_    time is up    _comma_    let ’ s go there now  .

 there is a sign at the corner of the street  .  when you turned in here   _comma_   you should have seen it  .  
 i didn t see it  .  
 i am sorry   _comma_   sir  .  i have to give you a ticket  .  you can appeal to the court within    days  .  you will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault  .  
are you a goal oriented person ? 
 yes   _comma_   i am  .  i always make a plan before i do anything  .  
 where do you want to be in   years ? 
 i don t want to have a specific title  .  i just want to enjoy what i am doing  .  
 that sounds very reasonable  .  
 it s the most important thing to me  .  
 if you are hired   _comma_   how long do you plan to stay with us ? 
 that obviously depends on how things go     whether i m suited to the firm and the firm to me  .  
 tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them  .  
 i want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position  .  in order to achieve this goal   _comma_   i just want to work step by step  .  
 what is your long range objective ? 
 i haven t thought it over at all  .

i d like to open a current account  .  
 certainly  .  may i see your social security and your id   _comma_   please  .  
 here you are  .  i wonder how much interest can i earn from a current account  .  
 oh   _comma_   current accounts don t pay out interest  .  
 why is that ? 
 it s primarily designed for business transactions  .  that is    _comma_    writing checks to pay for bills    _comma_    buying things and sending money  .  we won t expect a large amount of deposit in a current account  .  
 i see  .  how do i draw money for my own use then ?

hi   _comma_   mark  .  
 hi   _comma_   bill  .  i ’ d like to take the apartment i looked at yesterday  .  
 all right  .  
 so   _comma_   what do we do now ? 
 this is the lease  .  you should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant  .  the lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords  .  
 okay  .  ( reads the lease ) so     _comma_     according to the lease     _comma_     i ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit     _comma_     and i have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance  .  i understand that i ’ ll get the security deposit back when i move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs  .  
 yes  .  if you do not damage the apartment   _comma_   you will get your security deposit back when you move out  .  
 can i pay you by check ? 
 sure  .  a check will be fine  .  
 is there a laundry room in the basement ? 
 yes  .  
 can i sign the lease right now ? 
good morning ! what can i do for you ? 
 i m thinking of travelling to suzhou in july  .  could you recommend some tourist programs for that ? 
 with pleasure  .  we arrange two kinds of tourist programs for suzhou   _comma_   a six day tour by train and a five day flying journey  .  
 how much does a six day tour by train cost ? 
 five hundred yuan  .  
 does that include hotels and meals ? 
 oh    _comma_    yes    _comma_    and admission tickets for places of interest as well  .  
 that sounds reasonable  .  what about the five day flying journey ? how much is that ? 
 eight hundred and fifty yuan  .  
 covering all expenses ? 
 yes  .  but there is no half fare for children  .  they must pay full fare  .  
i can t believe you wear jeans to the office ! are you trying to lose your job ? 
 of course not  .  i m just observing casual day  .  on fridays   _comma_   the company doesn t require us to wear formal business attire  .  
 wow ! nobody told me about that  .  won t the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? 
 we don t think so  .  casual days are becoming more common   _comma_   and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes  .  
 i guess it lets people express their individual tastes  .  but won t some people abuse it ? 
 not really  .  besides   _comma_   there is a separate dress code for casual day  .  people can t just wear whatever they want  .  
 it seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity  .  
 believe it or not   _comma_   it has the opposite effect  .  employees are actually more productive on casual days  .

 sure  .  thank you  .  it seems your business is prosperous  .  there are many customers here  .  
 yes   _comma_   it s not too bad  .  our sales are going up year after year  .  and we still have a large potential production capacity  .  
 well   _comma_   what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ? 
 that s a good idea  .  so far   _comma_   we have several agents abroad  .  
 we are willing to be your agent in thailand for hand held tools  .  what do you think ? 
 that sounds good  .  
 then   _comma_   what s your usual commission rate for your agents ? 
 usually   _comma_   we give a commission of   % to our agents  .  
   % is too low         _comma_         i think  .  you see         _comma_         we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion         _comma_         such as advertising on radio or tv         _comma_         printing booklets         _comma_         leaflets         _comma_         catalogues and so on  .  it all costs money         _comma_           % is not enough  .  
 don t worry  .  we ll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase  .  
 you mean to saya 
 it sounds ok  .  then how do you pay the commission ? 
 we may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment  .  
 all right  .  if it s okay   _comma_   we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately  .  
 think it over  .  we hope to keep a good business relationship with you  .  
 thank you for your help  .

 i ’ m not going to put this off any longer   _comma_   casey ! i want those photos asap !

 what s going on ? 
 look  .  two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other  .  that s why that car stops  .  
 more and more people easily get irritated while driving  .  
 yes  .  this is what is called road rage  .  
this is today ’ s schedule  .  at   thirty am    _comma_    conference with the department managers  .  at   o ’ clock    _comma_    live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives  .  
 that ’ s great  .  what are the prizes ? 
      rib as bonus for each person  .  
 to encourage the staff increases  .  
 ok  .  next thing is laying the corner stone for the new plant at    am  .  at    am   _comma_   back here for lunch  .  
 what about the afternoon ? 
 at   pm     _comma_     give a presentation here with the press  .  at four o ’ clock sharp     _comma_     have dinner with mr  .  smith     _comma_     manager of ncc  .  
this is lincoln bank   _comma_   consumer credit department  .  how can i help you ? 
 ah   _comma_   hello  .  i m calling to find out how i apply for a car loan  .  
 we offer a personal automobile consumer loan  .  the application process is pretty straight forward  .  i trust you have enough funds to cover the    % down payment ? 
 yes   _comma_   i do  .  it s ready and waiting in my account  .  
 the next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you    _comma_    who are already contracted to us    _comma_    so  .  
 could i just stop you there ? sorry to interrupt   _comma_   but i have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car i want  .  
 that will certainly cut down the processing time  .  we can move on to the next step  .  do you have the purchase price ? 
 yes       _comma_       it s          _comma_          rib  .  so       _comma_       with the down payment done       _comma_       i will need to borrow         _comma_          rib  .  
 what we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form      _comma_      id card      _comma_      proof of residency      _comma_      proof of income      _comma_      the agreement from the agent and of course the    % down payment  .  
 yes    _comma_    i have everything here  .  ok    _comma_    i ll come in and see you later today  .  maybe i could have my new car as early as next week ! how exciting ! 
hi   _comma_   my name is tom  .  
 tom   _comma_   the new sales representative ? nice to meet you ! i m melinda  .  
 nice to meet you too . melinda  .  
 now let me show you around  .  this is our reception area   _comma_   and our conference room is right over there  .  over here is the sales department  .  
 really ? this is a nice office   _comma_   but it s quite small  .  
 yeah  .  you can make photocopies and send faxes over there  .  
 it looks like you guys work hard  .  
 i tell you what just between you and me    _comma_    we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard . just kidding  .  oh    _comma_    your cubicle is over the  .  and this way  .  those are all private offices the managers offices  .  
 hmm  .  tell me more details about our jobs  .  
 sure thing  .  
what do you think of our price ? 
 your price has gone up sharply   _comma_   hasn t it ? 
 yes  .  we regret we cannot maintain our original price  .  since the prices of the raw materials have been raised   _comma_   we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly  .  
 i agree with you there   _comma_   but your price is unreasonable  .  
 i don t think so  .  you must compare our price with that of other export houses  .  i m sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level  .  
 i don t think we ll be able to pay the price  .  to have this business concluded   _comma_   you need to lower your price at least by   %  .  
 i ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price  .  
 don t you agree with me that in the long run   _comma_   moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? 
 we ve already cut down our price to cost level  .  
 is that all ? 
 yes   _comma_   this is the best we can do  .  
 i m sorry we can t handle the price you offered  .  
so    _comma_    jimmy    _comma_    how does it feel to have your own money ? 
 it ’ s great    _comma_    dad  .  i don ’ t mind delivering papers    _comma_    but the real fun is collecting the money  .  
 even though you are only twelve   _comma_   it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money  .  
 i ’ ve never had a bank account before  .  why don ’ t i just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? 
 you know you would spend it  .  and also   _comma_   money in the bank earns interest  .  
 but what if i need my money suddenly ? 
 the bank will give you a pin   _comma_   and you can withdraw money from any atm  .  
 great ! so it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! 
 not quite  .  you have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars  .  and sometimes the bank has service charges  .  but you don ’ t have to worry about that yet  .  let ’ s go make your first depot 
 ok  .  guess i have to do that before  .  i can make money my first withdrawal  .  
is this where i can catch a bus to the theater ? 
 yes   _comma_   but you can t get there with out a change  .  
 which bus do i have to change ? 
 you have to get off at the hospital and change for bus     .  
 i see  .  thank you  .  
here we are    _comma_    joan  .  this is the palace museum    _comma_    also known as the forbidden city  .  
 oh   _comma_   how splendid ! can you take a picture of me here ? 
 sure  .  
excuse me  .  i m afraid i got lost  .  where am i on this map ? 
 we are here    _comma_    bus station    _comma_    we are in the heart of the city  .  
 oh ! can i go from here to the zhongshan park ? 
 head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right  .  
tony   _comma_   could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ? 
 working hours are from  :    a  .  m  .  to  :   p  .  m  .  be sure not to be late or absent  .  report to the manager by filling in the   monthly report   every month  .  
 is there anything else ? how about my salary ? 
 our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard  .  on the   th day of every month   _comma_   you can get your salary on time  .  benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee s past attendance record  .  
 wow      _comma_      thank you for telling me these  .  do you mind telling me something else      _comma_      like attendance record      _comma_      holiday      _comma_      and how to ask for leave ? 
 all new members are likely to ask the same questions  .  haha  .  i can understand that  .  every month you have three days off     _comma_     besides the weekends and some important holidays  .  after you ve been here for a year     _comma_     you qualify for a one week vacation  .  the leave less than a half day should predict for an hour     _comma_     and more than a half day should predict three days  .  
 okay   _comma_   that s good  .  i get it  .  
kate   _comma_   you never believe what s happened  .  
 what do you mean ? 
 masha and hero are getting divorced  .  
 you are kidding  .  what happened ? 
 well     _comma_     i don t really know     _comma_     but i heard that they are having a separation for   months     _comma_     and filed for divorce  .  
 that s really surprising  .  i always thought they are well matched  .  what about the kids ? who get custody ? 
 masha    _comma_    it seems quiet and makable    _comma_    no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out  .  
 that s the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about  .  well     _comma_     i still can t believe it     _comma_     masha and hero     _comma_     the perfect couple  .  when would they divorce be final ? 
 early in the new year i guess  .  
overseas operator  .  
 i would like to make a collect call to taipei    _comma_    taiwan    _comma_    please  .

 yes  .  can i help you ? 
 do you remember me ? i just had lunch here a half hour ago  .  
 of course i remember you  .  
 i think i lost my wallet here  .  
 oh   _comma_   no  .  really ? i didn t see anything  .  
 really ? you didn t find a wallet ? 
 no   _comma_   i didn t  .  would you like to go look by the table with me ? 
 yes   _comma_   i would  .  it s not here  .  and it s not on the floor . has anyone sat at this table since we left ? 
 no  .  it s been empty the whole time  .  
 hmm  .  i don t know how it could have happened  .  
 i remember     _comma_     sir     _comma_     that your friend took the bill . you didn t pay for the lunch yourself     _comma_     did you ? 
 no  .  my friend did  .  
 then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? 
 no   _comma_   i m not sure  .  but i usually take out my wallet when i sit down . it   s uncomfortable to sit on it  .  so i usually put it next to me on the table  .  
 maybe you lost it before you came here  .  or maybe you left it at home  .  
 i don t think it s at home  .  i think i had it when i left the house . but what should i do ? 
 well        _comma_        the first thing you should do is make sure it s not at home . then        _comma_        if it isn t        _comma_        you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards  .  next        _comma_        you need to replace whatever you lost        _comma_        your driver s license        _comma_        things like that  .  
 should i call the police ? 
 you can if you want  .  but the police usually don t do anything about lost wallets  .  
 hmm  .  i ll go home and check  .  maybe you re right  .  maybe it s at home  .  
 i m sorry we couldn t find it   _comma_   sir  .  
 thanks for your help  .

just as the saying goes   _comma_   every potter praises his own pot  .  you should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview  .  
 it is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time  .  
 you d better prepare what you are going to say in advance   _comma_   in order to have a good performance in the interview  .  
 the contents should be mainly descriptions of your background  .  and the length depends on the particular situation  .  
 only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in   _comma_   can you make a targeted preparation  .  
 to sell yourself successfully   _comma_   you should leave the interviewer a deep impression  .  
 selling yourself should go straight to the point   _comma_   and the statement should be clear and brief  .  
 it should also be truthful and realistic  .  do not blindly blow your own horn  .  
 you should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for  .  
 while you should not omit your weak points   _comma_   they need to be described appropriately 
 time permitted   _comma_   you could add certain examples to your description  .  
 besides    _comma_    in the interview    _comma_    it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly  .

 i know  .  this is terrible  .  what can we do ? this snow doesn t stop falling ! 
 i told you we should have stayed in town today . the weather report said     percent chance of snow . why did you want to come up here ? 
 i wanted to show you the cabin  .  we only had another half hour to go  .  
 well   _comma_   now we re stuck  .  what can we do ? 
 i don t know  .  
 i ve heard that when this happens   _comma_   it s important to save energy  .  
 what do you mean ? 
 we re stranded here   _comma_   tom  .  we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car  .  the car s energy is what will keep us warm  .  
 i have plenty of gas  .  
 yes    _comma_    but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . we can t just let the car run and run . if we do    _comma_    it will die soon  .  then we ll freeze  .  
 so what can we do ? 
 turn the lights off . then   _comma_   run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible  .  
 alright  .  that s a good idea  .  
 i wish we hadn t come up here  .  now we ll probably be here for days  .  
 days ? 
 yes   _comma_   it happens . that is what happens in big snowstorms  .  people get stranded for days  .  
 oh   _comma_   my god ! it s good we have food  .  
 probably we ll survive . but turn the car off for about forty five minutes  .  then we ll turn it on again  .  
hey    _comma_    buddy    _comma_    can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ? 
 oh   _comma_   sorry  .  i didn ’ t know  .

 no   _comma_   i ’ m afraid not  .  
 well    _comma_    you have to wait in line like everyone else  .  besides    _comma_    you should let old people on first  .  
 sorry  .

 i wanted to see the white house  .  
 oh    _comma_    well you don ’ t want this bus    _comma_    anyway  .  it goes to georgetown  .

 that sounds good     _comma_     thanks     _comma_     i d like that  .  actually i d like sprite instead of coke     _comma_     thanks  .  
 that s not a problem   _comma_   miss  .  will that be it ? 
 yes   _comma_   that s all  .  
 that will be   rmb   _comma_   please

 yes   _comma_   we will depart in    minutes  .  
 is that a guided tour ? 
 yes   _comma_   it is  .  
 that s fine  .  let s get on the bus  .  
i am sure we will make it up as soon as possible  .  
 that s nice  .  
 we hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings  .  
 of course not  .  we have cooperated for a long time  .  
i would like to purchase some meat  .  
 what kind of meat would you like to get today ? 
 first off   _comma_   i m going to need a pound of ground beef  .  
 a pound of ground beef is     .     .  
 that s perfect  .  
 what else will you be needing ? 
 i m also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts  .  
 the chicken breasts cost     .    per pound  .  
 what s the total price for the chicken ? 
 it s going to be      .     .  
 okay   _comma_   i think that will be all for me today  .  
i think you know already that i want to discuss the represent   ton for your alarm clocks  .  
 yes    _comma_    mr  .  bergeron  .  you mentioned that in your letter  .  to tell you the truth    _comma_    your proposal surprised us  .  
 is that so ? anyhow i want to go over the details with you in person     _comma_     so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration  .  our firm specializes in this line of business  .  we have six sales representatives     _comma_     who are on the road all the time     _comma_     covering the whole of the european market  .  
 do you sell direct to shops ? 
 yes    _comma_    we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts  .  we have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct    _comma_    without any middlemen  .  
 do you keep a stock of these things ? 
 in some cases        _comma_        such as the wristwatches        _comma_        which always have a steady market        _comma_        we keep a stock in london and act as distributors as well as agents  .  generally        _comma_        however        _comma_        we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply  .  we are paid for our service        _comma_        of course  .  
 that is   _comma_   your commission  .  
 yes   _comma_   our commission is very reasonable  .  we usually get a    % commission of the amount on every deal  .  
 our agents in other areas usually get a     % commission  .  
 the european market is not familiar with your products  .  you have competitors from japan and other continental countries  .  at the beginning of our campaign    _comma_    there is sales resistance to overcome    _comma_    we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news   papers and tv programs  .  a    % commission will not leave us much  .  
 according to your estimate     _comma_     what is the maximum annual turn   over you can fulfill     _comma_     in round figures     _comma_     of course ? 
 we will always do our utmost to enlarge the business     _comma_     as our remuneration increases with the turnover     _comma_     but we will not guar   ante anything     _comma_     at least not to begin with  .  
 we appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products  .  but our suggestion to you     _comma_     mr  .  bergeron     _comma_     as a preliminary step     _comma_     is to do a little research into the market  .  
 do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? 
 mr  .  bergeron   _comma_   you leave us no alternative  .  we can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole european market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover  .  besides our price is worked out according to the costing  .  a    % commission means an increase in our price  .  we must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect  .  
 oh   _comma_   that s just too bad  .  i intended to make great efforts in selling your products  .  
 well      _comma_      we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement  .  to start the ball rolling      _comma_      we will provide you with price lists      _comma_      catalogues and some samples  .  only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products      _comma_      can we then discuss further details  .  
 ah    _comma_    mrs  .  miller    _comma_    but in this case am i covered ? 
 oh   _comma_   yes  .  we will give you a   % commission on every transaction  .  
 all right   _comma_   but i ll be back again for the autumn fair  .  and then i hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency  .  
 very good  .  we will discuss the matter again at the next fair  .  
excuse me    _comma_    i ’ m sorry to trouble you  .  my name is susan ransom    _comma_    and i have placed several orders with you company  .  
 yes   _comma_   mr  .  ransom ? this is karl miller  .  how may i help you ? 
 well   _comma_   i wonder if you could track an order i placed with you last month  .  it hasn ’ t arrived yet  .  
 certainly   _comma_   ms  .  ransom  .  do you have an order number ? 
have you worked out the offers  .  mr  .  thou ? 
 yes   _comma_   we have  .  here s our cif quotation sheet  .  please have a careful look  .  
 are the prices on the list firm offers ? 
 yes  .  all the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation  .  
 i wonder whether there are any changes in your prices  .  
 all these products are our best selling lines  .  the prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand  .  and we are always open to negotiate   _comma_   especially on larger orders  .  what do you have in mind ? 
 how long does your offer remain valid ? i need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan  .  
 i understand  .  our offer remains open for   days  .  
hello sir   _comma_   may i help you ? 
 yeah   _comma_   i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet  .  
 i see  .  well   _comma_   you have come to the right place  .  we have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers  .  
 sounds good  .  i don ’ t want it to be too expensive   _comma_   maybe something mid range  .  
 we have this new etc smart phone . it comes with the android os so you can download applications  .  it also has a built in camera   _comma_   mp  player and touch screen  .  it works on the  g network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are  .  
 what about wi fi ? 
 of course ! you can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home  .  
 one last thing  .  is it waterproof ? 
we have been over this a hundred times ! we are not getting a pet ! 
 why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty ! 
 who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? 
 i will ! i ’ ll feed it   _comma_   bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a labrador or a german shepard ! 
 what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus   _comma_   our apartment is too small for that breed of dog  .  
 ok  .  how about we get a cat or a ferret ? 
 we ’ re planning on having children soon   _comma_   i don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house  .  
 fine ! let ’ s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome ! 
 i ’ ll tell you what   _comma_   i can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there  .  
 yay ! 
good evening   _comma_   mr  .  lee and thank you for choosing our airline  .  we have just discovered that this flight is overbooked  .  would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? 
 overbooked ? give up my seat ? i don ’ t understand  .  
 from time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft  .  that ’ s overbooked  .  
 i know what overbooked is   _comma_   i just don ’ t understand how that could happen ? 
 actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook     _comma_     as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled  .  most of the time there is no problem but today     _comma_     more passengers arrived than we have seats     _comma_     
 so who has to stay behind ? 
 well    _comma_    first we ask for volunteers  .  if someone like yourself volunteers    _comma_    they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year  .  if no one volunteers we just have to select someone  .  
 ok  .  i ’ ll volunteer  .  i could use a free ticket ! 
i want to rent this apartment  .  
 i ’ m glad to hear that  .  
 how much are you asking ? 
 you will have to pay        every month  .  
 i can ’ t afford that  .  
 what can you afford ? 
 i was thinking       a month  .  
 i ’ ll need you to pay more than that  .  
 how much more ? 
 how does       every month sound to you ? 
 i can live with that  .  
 we have a deal then  .

 and can i have some ketchup   _comma_   please ? 
 it s on the service counter over there  .  please go to help yourself  .  
what s the name of this street ? 
 university street  .  
 do you know of any banks near here ? 
 you ll see one at the corner on your right  .  
hey there   _comma_   you look a little lost  .  are you new here ?

 well   _comma_   i don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! i just want a good physique with weights and carpio  .  
 in that case you want to work with less weight  .  you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets  .  five kilo weights should be enough  .  now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle  .

 the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner  .  the station is at the end of that street  .  
 how long will it take me to get there ? 
 it s about a ten minute walk  .  
 that s very clear  .  i think i can find my way now  .  thank you  .  
 not at all  .  
how does the political system work in your country ? 
 we have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament  .  most people call them mp ’ s  .  
 each mp belongs to a political party   _comma_   right ? 
 almost all of them do  .  a few are independent  .  that means that they do not belong to a party  .  if one party more than half of the mp ’ s  .  they form a government  .  that means that they choose a prime finist 
 what ’ s a cabinet ? 
 this is a small group of people perhaps    mp ’ s who are usually ministers  .  they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy  .  
 can any mp make a law ? 
 any mp can present a law to parliament  .  the proposed law is debated and voted on  .  if it is accepted   _comma_   it becomes law  .  
 i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties  .  
 yes    _comma_    it does    _comma_    because they have most of the mp ’ s  .  most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to  .  
 how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ? 
 they produce manifesto  .  these documents which states their policies  .  some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election  .  voters who often change the party they vote for are calle 
how was your interview ? 
 pretty good  .  the hr manager asked me the usual questions  .  then he wondered why i had decided to leave my previous job  .  
 what did you say ? 
 i told him that i hadn ’ t got a raise for three years  .  i also told him that one of my best co workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years  .  
 did he want to know the reasons ? 
 yes  .  i told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession  .  but i thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only  .  
 that ’ s sex discrimination  .  when will you get the reply ? 
 in a couple of days   _comma_   i was told  .  
 wish you good luck ! 
 thank you  .  
what qualities do you think a senior executive should possess ?

 is there anything else i should pay attention to ? 
 yes      _comma_      when you attend the interview      _comma_      you should pay attention to your manner      _comma_      style of conversation and expression  .  you should keep smiling always      _comma_      being polite when you talk with the interviewer  .  don t move from time to time when you sit there  .  and you also should know how to use eye contact  .  
 thank you   _comma_   i ve learned so much from you  .

hi   _comma_   sam  .  i want to buy a pet  .  do you have any ideas ? 
 you really should go to rachel s pet store  .  
 why ? anything special there ? 
 it s more than special  .  you can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more  .  
 oh   _comma_   really ? are there any snakes ? 
 snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it s a world of exotic pets  .  
 that s terrific  .  i can t wait to check it out  .  
 hang on  .  are you sure you want to keep a non traditional pet ? 
 why not ? it s so cool  .  
 but it will pose a risk to your health  .  
 pardon ? 
 i mean   _comma_   most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria  .  they are likely to cause immune system problems  .  
 well   _comma_   i didn t realize that  .  
 i don t believe it s a good choice to keep those pets   _comma_   especially for families with young children  .  
 oh   _comma_   i should have thought of my brother s baby girl  .  maybe i ll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet  .  
 yes    _comma_    good luck    _comma_    maria  .  
i ’ m a new student  .  my name ’ s robert  .  
 nice to meet you  .  my name ’ s sophie  .

 what ’ s your job ? 
 i ’ m a keyboard operator  .  what ’ s your job ? 
 i ’ m an engineer  .  
i can ’ t believe obama is our president  .  
 i am proud to know that he is our president  .

 i did   _comma_   too  .  
 i have nothing but faith in obama  .

 oh     _comma_     i see     _comma_     sir  .  well     _comma_     it does take   working days to issue and post the card  .

 you should do one of the two things   either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company  .  
 shall we leave it to the brokers ? 
 yes  .  they usually do it  .  
 do they charge for that ? 
 of course  .  in europe   _comma_   they charge a commission of   % of the amount of the claim for their service  .  
 is it the same in america ? 
 they do the work without charge to the importer  .  
 it s part of their service   _comma_   isn t it ? 
 exactly  .  
 is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ? 
 no   _comma_   you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment  .

nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films  .  so i am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive  .  
 what you said is true  .  but the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience  .  for example    _comma_    to make more movie ccds    _comma_    so people will spend money buying them  .  
 but it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past  .  
 yes  .  take myself for example  .  i seldom go to cinemas    _comma_    but it doesn t mean i no longer see films ; instead    _comma_    i see films at home watching ccds  .  
okay   _comma_   well i ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position  .

 well feel free to ask me anything   _comma_   and i ’ ll try to fill in the details  .  
 could i first ask about the remuneration package ? 
 yes     _comma_     of course  .  that ’ s quite an important point     _comma_     isn ’ t it ? as a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of        _comma_        hk dollars per annum  .  this doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance also  .  
 i understand  .  and are there other bonuses included ? 
 well   _comma_   apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers  .  but we could go through all the details of that at a later date  .  
 well    _comma_    mr  .  parsons    _comma_    i am flexible when it comes to salary  .  the opportunity to work in hong kong for you is the most important thing for me  .

 we ll be taking everything offline in about two hours   time  .  it ll be down for a minimum of twelve hours  .  if everything goes according to plan   _comma_   it should be up again by   pm on saturday  .  
 that s fine  .  we ve allowed forty eight hours to be on the safe side  .

 yes   _comma_   i m glad we ve had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years  .  and your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years  .  
 so    _comma_    i wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market  .  if you give us the agency    _comma_    that will be more substantial for our cooperation  .  
 to be frank   _comma_   you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country  .  i d like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent  .

 do you mind if i go with you ? 
 not at all  .  these private sales are great places to bargain  .  and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk  .  
 i learned to negotiate from my mother  .  i thought i was pretty good at bargaining   _comma_   but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store  .  
 what happened ? 
 i wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend  .  it was priced at forty dollars   _comma_   so i started by offering the salesclerk thirty  .  
do you do a lot of your shopping online ? 
 not really  .  i like looking on the internet at what ’ s available     _comma_     but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i ’ m buying before i pay for it  .  sometimes     _comma_     i ’ ll look at something in a shop     _comma_     but lat 
 no  .  i ’ m a little worried about security  .  you never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords  .  aren ’ t you worry about that ? 
 not really  .  i know that it happens     _comma_     but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites     _comma_     you should be ok  .  even though i use online shopping facilities     _comma_     i don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho

mr  .  dick  .  does the recommendation of the university play an important role ? 
 yes  .  in fact      _comma_      the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self recommendation  .  in the long period of cooperation      _comma_      the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations      _comma_      they trust each other well  .  if your university recommends you      _comma_      you can be approved more easily  .  
 but i find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same  .  so i doubt its authority  .  
 more and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy  .  if your university also does like this    _comma_    you can look for other methods    _comma_    because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you  .  
 could you tell me whether or not i send out my resume with it ? 
 it depends  .  if it has something special or useful   _comma_   i suggest you send it out  .  
taylor   _comma_   can you tell me how to apply for a job on the internet ?

 but i still don t know which unit is in need of staff  .  
 send out an application through job wanted on the website  .  
 can any unit see my information ? 
 it s a two way choice  .  and your application will be read  .  
 which websites offer this service ? 
 sina    _comma_      st century talent net    _comma_    and a few others  .

 let me tell you about the specials of the day    _comma_    which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers    _comma_    and grilled garlic shrimp  .  
 i was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce  .  
 the chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests  .  
 i am a vegetarian  .  do you have any vegetarian selections ? 
 you could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad  .  
 i think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza  .  
 that is a good selection   _comma_   and i can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree  .  
 you can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree  .

 it s     yuan  .  
mrs  .  wang   _comma_   would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? 
 as i said before   _comma_   your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid  .  we hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap  .  
 just to comply   _comma_   we re ready to reduce the price by   percent  .  i hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling  .  
 so do we  .  certainly it s a step forward on your side  .  but the gap is still too wide  .  
 the ball is in your court   _comma_   mrs . wang  .  what price would you suggest ? 
 to make your offer workable   _comma_   i think you should take another step down as big as the one you ve just taken  .  
 that won t do  .  you see   _comma_   our profit margin is very narrow  .  it simply can t stand such a big cut  .  
 i hate to disappoint you      _comma_      mr  .  brown      _comma_      but if that s the case      _comma_      we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere  .  do think it over      _comma_      please  .  we sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion  .  
 well    _comma_    i m not authorized to agree to such a big reduction  .  would you mind waiting a day or two    _comma_    until i get a reply from the home office ? 
 not at all  .  shall we meet again    _comma_    say    _comma_    on friday morning ? 
 good  .  friday morning at    .  
good morning  .  
 good morning . this is mary . can i speak to anne please ? 
 i ’ m sorry she isn ’ t in at the momment . she will come back at half past ninecan i take a message for her ? 
 thank you . but i will call her later 
 ok . goodbye  .  
 goodbye  .  
hi   _comma_   jane  .  how are you doing this morning ? 
 i ’ m all right   _comma_   thanks  .  just a little tired  .  
 late night ? 
 yeah   _comma_   i got home around two  .  
we ve been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now   _comma_   and there still isn t a bus in sight  .  
 i m afraid we ll be late for the party  .  
 have you got the time   _comma_   tom ? 
 yes   _comma_   my watch says a quarter to seven  .  but there is something wrong with my watch ! 
 but you bought it only last month  .  
 yes     _comma_     but ever since i bought it     _comma_     it gains about five minutes a day     _comma_     so i   ve got to have it repaired  .  
 how long will it take us to get there ? 
 i think about ten minutes by bus  .  
 it s not far away    _comma_    then  .  let s walk    _comma_    it s beginning to rain  .  
 wait ! i think i see a bus coming now  .  let s hope it s the no  .     bus  .  
hi   _comma_   mr  .  smith  .  i m doctor hawkins  .  why are you here today ? 
 i found it would be a good idea to get a check up  .  
 yes    _comma_    well    _comma_    you haven t had one for   years  .  you should have one every year  .  
 i know  .  i figure as long as there is nothing wrong   _comma_   why go see the doctor ? 
 well   _comma_   the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early  .  so try to come at least once a year for your own good  .  
 ok  .  
 let me see here  .  your eyes and ears look fine  .  take a deep breath    _comma_    please  .  do you smoke    _comma_    mr  .  smith ? 
 yes  .  
 smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease   _comma_   you know  .  you really should quit  .  
 i ve tried hundreds of times   _comma_   but i just can t seem to kick the habit  .  
 well   _comma_   we have classes and some medications that might help  .  i ll give you more information before you leave  .  
 ok   _comma_   thanks doctor  .  
good afternoon  .  mr  .  tylor s office ? 
 i m afraid you ve got the wrong extension  .  
 i m sorry   _comma_   but could you please transfer this call to mr  .  tylor s office ? 
 sure   _comma_   please hold on  .  
 thank you  .  
 now mr  .  tylor s on the line  .  go ahead   _comma_   please  .  
 you are so kind   _comma_   you helped me a lot  .  
 you are welcome  .  bye ! 
good afternoon    _comma_    lexington software  .  angelina dawson    _comma_    how can i help ? 
 hello   _comma_   this is quinn from iba  .  
 ah     _comma_     hello quinn  .  oh dear     _comma_     you are calling to tell me there is a problem     _comma_     aren t you ? 
 i m afraid so   _comma_   yes  .  
 hmm  .  well    _comma_    it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake    _comma_    or can we just alter it ? 
 unfortunately it s rather a big mistake  .  
 what do you recommend we do ? 
 i would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible  .  
 i trust your judgement  .  thank you   _comma_   quinn  .  i ll be back tomorrow with a new set  .  bye for now  .  
oh ! ! ! i have a horrible toothache  .  
 you should go to the dentist  .  
 i hate dentists  .  
 well    _comma_    suffer then  .  if you have a toothache    _comma_    you have to go to the dentist  .  
 it always hurts  .  i hate going  .  
 stop being such a baby  .  if it really hurts that much   _comma_   just let them knock you out  .  
 o  .  k  .     _comma_    o  .  k  .     _comma_    i ’ ll go  .  
 good  .  you ll feel better after you do  .  
hi    _comma_    i would like to purchase a one way ticket to brussels    _comma_    please  .  
 certainly sir   _comma_   this is our train schedule  .  we have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm  .  
 how long does it take to get there ? 
 about twelve hours  .  we currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train  .  if you ’ d like   _comma_   you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive  .  
 yeah   _comma_   i think that is the best option  .  do you serve food on the train ? twelve hours is such a long time ! 
 yes   _comma_   of course  .  there is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times  .  we do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers  .  
 great ! i ’ ll take it  .  
 here you are sir  .  your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot  .  remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! 
 i understand  .  thank you very much ! 
 have a great trip  .  
i would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend  .  
 a trip to the beach would be fun  .  how is the weather going to be ? 
 the forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend  .  
 so do you think it ll be perfect weather for the beach ? 
 it sounds like it will be  .  
 i really hope it doesn t get cold  .  
 that would ruin things   _comma_   i want to go so badly  .  
 the weather in california is unpredictable   _comma_   so you never know  .  
 that is true  .  the weather is constantly changing  .  
 it would be nice if the weather would never change  .  
 that would be great   _comma_   then we could plan things sooner  .  
 true  .  predictable weather would make life easier  .  
some companies use to ban dating among employees   _comma_   but now they have realized it is something in avertable  .  people spend so much time at work  .  it is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other  .  
 if we think positively   _comma_   office love can be beneficial to company  .  
 beneficial ? i don ’ t think so  .  if two employees get married      _comma_      they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon      _comma_      or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies  .  if they break up      _comma_      the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable  .  by any means      _comma_      the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating  .  
 but if two employees are in love    _comma_    they will be happy  .  happy people are more productive  .  if they develop an intimate relation with each other    _comma_    they are willing to share knowledge and experience  .  it can help to improve work efficiency  .  
 i doubt that  .  
do you eat a lot of healthy food ? 
 compared with healthy food     _comma_     unhealthy food just tastes so much better  .  and anyway     _comma_     i believe if you live a low stress life and are active     _comma_     you can get away with eating whatever you like  .  it s all in the mind  .  
 you have the point  .  i think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume  .  some good things you should try are cranberry juice   _comma_   wild rice and yoghurt  .  
 what s special about these things ? 
 cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it s very acidic  .  wild rice is high in fibre so it s good for your guts and it s high in protein and minerals i think it s also tastier than normal rice  .  yoghurt s good because it s also rich in protein    _comma_    vitamins and is also acidic  .  people have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day    _comma_    your guts will be much more settled  .  
 thanks  .  i m going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now  .  
i ve been so tired recently  .  i ve been trying   _comma_   but i don t think i m up to this job  .  
 you need to take a break   _comma_   maybe a vacation  .  
 oh     _comma_     yes     _comma_     indeed  .  i ve run out of steam  .  to be honest     _comma_     i want to be in a different environment  .  
 is that so ? 
 yes   _comma_   i don t want to be stuck in a rut  .  i want to move on  .  
 have you decided ? 
 yes  .  i want to get a better job  .  
 could you tell me why you want to quit ? 
 i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues  .  
 oh   _comma_   that s terrible  .  do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? 
 i m afraid not  .  i ve promised my girlfriend  .  we ll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay  .  
 ok    _comma_    i d like to say that i ve really enjoyed working with you  .  however    _comma_    i think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay  .  
 thank you so much for your advice  .  
 and every best wish for your new job  .  
 thank you  .  
the train is leaving  .  hurry up ! which car are we in ? 
 let me see  .  oh   _comma_   no  .      .  
 here we are   _comma_   car     .  let s get in  .  
 seats no  .     and     .  it ’ s nice that we ’ ve got a window seat  .  
 let s put our suitcases on the rack  .  
 oh   _comma_   the baggage rack is full  .  put them under the seat for the time being  .  
 all right  .  
so   _comma_   how should we get to the theatre ? 
 let s take the bus  .  
 i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude    _comma_    the buses are never on time    _comma_    and there are few people around who can help you  .  
 it s not that bad  .  you probably just had a bad experience once  .  
 it wasn t just once  .  every single time i take the bus   _comma_   something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus  .  
 we could take the subway   _comma_   but we d have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice  .  
 train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare   _comma_   too  .  
 if we don t hurry up   _comma_   we ll miss the show  .  should we take the bus ? 
 we re already late   _comma_   so i think we had better take a taxi  .  
 i don t think we ll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours  .  let s just take the bus  .  
 fine  .  have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives  .  
 it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes  .  don t worry  .  nothing bad will happen  .  i ll even buy your ticket for you  .  
 thanks   _comma_   that was nice of you  .  
 see   _comma_   now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! 
let s go over this plan again  .  
 from vancouver   _comma_   we bike along the border all the way to winnipeg  .  
 and that is mostly flat   _comma_   right ? 
 relatively    _comma_    once we re out of alberta    _comma_    anyway  .  then it s hills again in aitoba  .  
 and from winnipeg we go around the lakes through toronto   _comma_   right ? 
 that s right  .  and up in to quebec  .  and that s where we stop  .  
 it doesn t sound like that much when we go over the plan but that s a long   _comma_   long ride  .  
 are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ? 
good morning   _comma_   sir  .  what can i do for you ? 
 i m bill  .  i m in room      .  can you change the room for me ? it s too noisy  .  my wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made  .  she said it was too much for her  .  
 i m awfully sorry   _comma_   sir  .  i do apologize  .  room     is at the end of the corridor  .  it s possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet  .  
 anyhow   _comma_   i d like to change our room  .  
 no problem    _comma_    sir  .  we ll manage it    _comma_    but we don t have any spare room today  .  could you wait till tomorrow ? the american people to people education delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning  .  there ll be some rooms for you to choose from  .  
 all right  .  i hope we ll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep  .  
 be sure  .  i ll make a note of that  .  everything will be taken care of  .  and if there is anything more you need   _comma_   please let us know  .  
it s time for bed  .  
 i m not ready to go to sleep  .  i m not tired  .  
 it s quite late   _comma_   and you have an early day tomorrow  .  
 i m not going to be able to fall asleep  .  
 why don t you try counting sheep ? 
 i ve tried that before  .  it really doesn t work  .  
 that s beside the point   _comma_   you still need to go to bed  .  
 why can t i just stay up until i fall asleep ? 
 if i let you do that   _comma_   then you re just going to be up all night  .  
 i promise i ll go to sleep soon  .  
 no    _comma_    you re going to sleep now    _comma_    so good night  .  
 see you in the morning  .  
i see myself as being honest    _comma_    diligent    _comma_    persevering and creative  .  and i have a strong sense of responsibility  .  
 how about your psychological resilience ? 
 i think i can work well under pressure   _comma_   if necessary  .  
 how would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ? 
 i will just be sincere and friendly to others   _comma_   and i believe they will treat me the same way  .  
 you seem to be a kind hearted lady  .  
 thank you  .  i simply believe the goodness of human nature  .  
 please tell me your weaknesses if you can  .  
 i should admit that sometimes i care too much about the details  .  i am always in pursuit of perfection  .  
karen ? i need to go over a few things with you  .  
 certainly  .  mr  .  graham  .  when would you like to meet ? 
 i was thinking about this afternoon   _comma_   after the sales meeting  .  
 fine  .  at  :   ? 
i believe we   ve met before  .  my name s david  .  
 yes    _comma_    at your company    _comma_    i think  .  i m frank  .  
 oh   _comma_   i remember now . very nice to meet you again  .  
 nice meeting you   _comma_   too  .  
i made my little brother cry  .  
 shame on you ! 
i need some mascara  .  do you have good thickening mascara ? 
 of course  .  here is our thickening mascara  .  we also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes  .  
 alright  .  and i want to consider your eye shadow too  .  do you have a color chart can look at ? 
 we have a very wide selection of colors  .  and our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin  .  so it is very gentle on your eyelids  .  would you like to sample some ? 
 oh   _comma_   sure i will need to clean off my own eye shadow first  .  
 i can help you with that  .  
 thank you  .  
is this the baggage claim area for flight kb    ? 
 yes   _comma_   we are on the same plane  .  
 but i am a transfer passenger  .  i have a connecting flight to miami  .  
 so you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check in area  .  
 yes . it   s quite troublesome  .  
 why not go and find a porter ? 
billy   _comma_   you don ’ t look too well  .  maybe you should take the day off school  .  
 but mom ! today we ’ re playing football ! i love football ! 
 you ’ ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever  .  what ’ s that on your arm ? 
 i don ’ t know  .  it was there when i woke up this morning  .  
 it ’ s rash  .  i ’ d better take you to see the doctor  .  how did you get that bruise on your leg ? 
 i bashed it against the chair in my room  .  
 does it hurt ? 
 a little   _comma_   but not much  .  
 here  .  put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down  .  i ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast  .  
 if i ’ m better this afternoon   _comma_   can i go to school ? 
 if you are better   _comma_   but i doubt you will be  .  
this is your schedule  .  
 you re going out of your way for us   _comma_   i believe  .  
 you are our honored guests  .  
are there any vacancies still available ? 
 yes  .  we need a plumber here  .  
 i am looking for a job that is more advanced than that   _comma_   such as sales manager or regional manager  .  
 i am sorry  .  they are not available now  .  
my name is mary   _comma_   and i will be your waitress tonight  .  
 thank you   _comma_   mary  .  we have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant  .  
 before your main course   _comma_   would you like to order an appetizer ? 
 sure   _comma_   that sounds great  .  where are your appetizers listed ? 
 there is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table  .  
 the chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good  .  is that pretty good ? 
 you know   _comma_   that is one of my favorites ! 
 ok   _comma_   i ll take one order of that  .  
 you could choose another appetizer for half price to share  .  
 perfect ! please add on an order of onion rings  .  
i am waiting for a fax but just now i found there s something wrong with the fax machine  .  
 what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ? 
 yes    _comma_    very urgent  .  and there is no other fax machine around  .  and the office of our boss is closed    _comma_    so i can not use his machine either  .  and his secretary is out  .  do you have any suggestion ? 
 either call this extension number      or ask them to send the fax to you as e mail   _comma_   you print it out  .  
i would like to speak to you   _comma_   if you don ’ t mind  .  
 what would you like to speak to me about ? 
 i would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election  .  
 is that right ? 
 i am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign  .  
 that ’ s wonderful  .  i am impressed at someone so young taking a stand  .  
 i know history is about to be made   _comma_   and i would like to be a part of it  .  
 that ’ s fantastic  .  
 are you planning on voting ? 
 i ’ m going to vote  .  
 go to your polling place early on election day  .  
 i will  .  good luck with your volunteering  .  
we hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future  .  
 yes  .  i promise it will not happen again  .  
 we look forward to your settlement at an early date  .  
 we will inform you as soon as possible  .  
hello   _comma_   steven  .  how do you get along with your job ? 
 actually   _comma_   i learn many things from it  .  i find that i am a quick learner in new things  .  
 practice makes perfect  .  by the way   _comma_   what do you learn from your job ? 
 at first i didn t know anything about the machine  .  now i know how to operate it  .  besides   _comma_   the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement  .  
 yeah   _comma_   you are a good learner  .  i must commend you for your good performance  .  
 thank you  .  that s a long way to go for my job  .  
 i appreciate your effort very much  .  the coffee break is over ; it s about time we set to work  .  
 ok   _comma_   let s go  .  
where on earth are we ? 
 judging by all the traffic   _comma_   i d say we re near the outskirts of the city  .  
 what did i do wrong ? did i take a wrong turn ? 
 i m not sure   _comma_   but i think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge  .  
 well   _comma_   now we should turn back a few kilometres  .  
 it seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map  .  
hello  .  front desk  .  
 yes  .  this is bob robinson  .  i ’ m calling from room number      .  
 hi   _comma_   bob  .  what can i do for you ? 
 is it possible to change to another room ? 
 could you please tell me why ? 
 my room is facing the swimming pool  .  it ’ s noisy for me  .  i have a problem sleeping  .  and i feel uncomfortable when i take an elevator  .  
 so you need a quiet side room on the lower floor  .  
 you ’ re right  .  
 okay  .  let me check for a room on the first floor  .  
 thank you  .  
 i ’ ve only two rooms on the first floor  .  how about room     ? 
 that ’ s fine  .  can i move now ? 
 sure  .  i ’ ll send the bellman to help you  .  
 oh   _comma_   thank you kindly  .  
 you ’ re welcome  .  
how long will it take for our order to be delivered ? 
 let s see  .  you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china  .  they should be able to place your order before the end of next week  .  it will take   days for shipping to the port city of ningpo  .  the freight will take   weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today  .  domestic shipping will be your responsibility   _comma_   you can make arrangements with the pier in los angeles  .  
 fine    _comma_    we will handle domestic shipping    _comma_    but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we don t run into any problems with the border control  .  
 no    _comma_    the chinese company has that all worked out  .  with the paperwork you receive with the shipment    _comma_    you should be good to go  .  
now you re my boss   _comma_   mr  .  henry  .  
 do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
 no   _comma_   nothing in particular  .  
 you may ask questions about us   _comma_   if you have any  .  
 all right  .  when can i start ? 
what are you doing here today ? 
 i would like to fight my ticket  .  
 is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ? 
 yes   _comma_   the officer is here today  .  
 what s your case ? 
 i was pulled over for running a red light   _comma_   but i never did  .  
 do you believe that the officer lied ? 
 there was a camera on the signal  .  so   _comma_   he was obviously lying  .  
 your license plate was caught on camera ? 
 a picture of my license plate was never taken  .  
 since there is no picture of your license plate on record   _comma_   i m going to let you go  .  
 thank you  .  i m glad that you believe me  .  
hey joe   _comma_   what are you doing in this department store ? 
 hi    _comma_    rita    _comma_    i m just looking for a pair of shoes  .  i won t be here for long  .  
 why not ? when i go shoe shopping   _comma_   i have so many options for sneakers that i spend awhile looking at all of the choices  .  
 that s my problem  .  i don t have a lot of options  .  
 what do you mean ? this is a big store   _comma_   isn t it ? 
 yes    _comma_    but i have unusually big feet  .  that wouldn t be too much of a problem except that they re also very wide    _comma_    and only a few brands sell shoes that i can fit into  .  
 so how do you usually go about buying shoes   _comma_   then ? 
 well    _comma_    first of all    _comma_    i can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection  .  
 well    _comma_    you re in the right store  .  if they don t have it    _comma_    no one will  .  
 after that i choose something from one of the few brands that i know will fit me  .  i prefer white    _comma_    so i ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size  .  since i ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications    _comma_    it makes it a very easy choice  .  
what shall we do after the volleyball match ? 
 how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym  .  
 that s a good idea  .  i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family  .  
 me   _comma_   too  .  what did you have in mind ? 
 i haven t decided yet   _comma_   but i think the olympic mascots are a must  .  
 i agree  .  they re very lovely   _comma_   especially   huan huan    .  
 is that the red one ? that is my favorite   _comma_   too  .  do you know how much they are ? 
 the five dolls are sold together as a set   _comma_   and they re priced according to the size  .  the bigger they are the more expensive  .  
 oh    _comma_    i see  .  if i buy more than a set    _comma_    can i get any discount ? 
 i don t think so  .  all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now  .  
 any other ideas ? 
 there are lots of things     _comma_     such as postcards     _comma_     key chains     _comma_     posters and various arts and crafts  .  
 it all sounds great  .  we can go there after the match  .  i can t wait to see what they have  .

it was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place  .  it gave me a good idea of your product range  .  
 it ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers  .  what ’ s your general impression   _comma_   may i ask ? 
 very impressive    _comma_    indeed    _comma_    especially the speed of your nw model  .  
 that ’ s our latest development  .  a product with high performance  .  we put it on the market just two months ago  .  
 the machine gives you an edge over your competitors   _comma_   i guess  .  
 certainly  .  no one can match us as far as speed is concerned  .  
 could you give me some brochures for that machine ? and the price if possible  .  
 right  .  here is our sales catalog and literature  .  
 thank you  .  i think we may be able to work together in the future  .  
is the factory fully automated ? 
 not completely  .  our production process is partially automated  .  we use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually  .  
 what about supply of parts to the production line ? 
 well   _comma_   the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar code system  .  and there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line  .  
 what about the smaller components ? 
 they re transported to the workstations on automated vehicles   robot trucks   which run on guide rails around the factory  .  
i m glad you re on your ten year reunion planning committee  .

 i guess  .  don t you have reunions in taiwan ? 
 definitely  .  every year  .  but just for our forty person class  .  
 ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year  .  
what does your job involve ? 
 i m the project manager so i have to make sure our projects run smoothly  .  i work with three project engineers  .  they take care of after sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business  .  
how many languages can you speak ? 
 besides chinese   _comma_   i can speak english and french  .  
 you mean you can read and write both of them ? 
 no   _comma_   i can only carry on a simple conversation in french  .  
 can you read and write english well ? 
 i can speak the language better than read and write  .  
 do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of english speaking countries ? 
 i think so  .  i used to be an interpreter  .  
 do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ? 
 the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work  .  i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm  .  
what can i get for you ? here is the menu  .  
 let me have a look  .  well   _comma_   how many kinds of steaks do you have ? 
 we have sirloin steaks    _comma_    pepper steak    _comma_    and filet steak  .

 just a minute  .  i need to make a list of thinks that we need  .

 let ’ s get both  .  we need some coffee too  .  is that on your list ? 
 yes   _comma_   it is  .  here ’ s my list  .  is there anything that i ’ ve forgotten ? 
 i think you ’ ve got everything  .  i want to got some chocolate and some cheese  .

 i ’ m not sure  .  i ’ ll decide at the cheese counter   _comma_   when i can see what they have  .  have we got enough money ? 
 we don ’ t have enough cash   _comma_   so i ’ ll take my credit card and we can pay with that  .  where are the car keys ? 
 i ’ ve got them there  .  shall i drive ? 
hello   _comma_   can you tell me how to use the telephone ?

 do you have any difficulties in doing business in china ? you know the chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ? 
 i don t think i have any problem with our chinese partners  .  they have always followed the contract strictly  .  we can do business directly with the corporation  .  as i mentioned before   _comma_   the chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law  .  its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies  .  
 well   _comma_   it s known that the sino american relation is in a dilemma  .  does it influence your business in china ? 
 actually not at present  .  but we are afraid it will  .  you know policies influence business to some extent  .  i hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists  .  china is really a large market  .  we don t want to lose it  .  
 thank you  .  
 you re welcome  .

 do you have the package with you ? i would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost  .  
 do you insure package ? 
 yes  .  all you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for  .  
 is there a way that i can be sure that the people in south america receive my package ? 
 the post office rarely loses package  .  you can    _comma_    however    _comma_    request a rectum receipt  .

right    _comma_    let me run through your options  .  you can go ahead and cash your undue large amount deposit certificate if you really want to    _comma_    but i d recommend a personal durable commodities loan  .  
 ok   _comma_   what does that entail ? 
 it s not too much trouble to do it this way and remember    _comma_    your certificate is due in   months  .  if you can hold on to it    _comma_    it ll be much better for your finances  .  
 yes    _comma_    it does seem a little silly to cash it now  .  i ll probably need about      _comma_       rib  .  will that be a problem ? 
 not at all    _comma_    mr zu  .  as the certificate is due in   months    _comma_    you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate  .  
 i m glad you thought of this  .  i d have just gone ahead and cashed it ! and i suppose i can use the money from the certificate to pay back this personal durable commodities loan and i won t lose any interest   _comma_   right ? 
 exactly right  .  if you d like to go ahead    _comma_    i can process that for you now    _comma_    mr zu  .

 the trains for cambridge leave from king s cross station  .  they run approximately every half hour  .  most trains to cambridge go from platform    .  
 how do i get to king s cross ? 
 the best way is to take an underground tube train directly to king s cross  .  the underground station is just round the corner from here  .  
 can you show me on the map ? 
 it is very easy  .  just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads  .  the entrance to the underground station is about    meters further on  .

 ok  .  no problem  .  
we need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this  .  
 ok  .  let me send a memo around  .  
 schedule it for this afternoon   _comma_   when ken gets back  .  
 i don ’ t think he ’ s back today  .  
 oh   _comma_   that ’ s right  .  go ahead anyways  .  i ’ ll fill him in  .  we can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances ! 
 i know   _comma_   it ’ s a big one  .  
would you mind if i ask some personal questions ? 
 no  .  i don ’ t  .  please  .  
 are you in robust health ? 
 i have a little problem   _comma_   i m overweight for my height  .  i think i should go on a diet  .  
the consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us  .  we have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality i am afraid  .  
 is there anything wrong ? 
 we bought     _comma_       sets of chemical instruments from you    _comma_    but there are    not up to the standard  .  
 it s hard for us to believe it  .  our instruments have been the best quality for years  .  have you any reliable evidence ? 
 here is the survey report from a well known public surveyor in london  .  you may inspect the defective instruments personally 
 well  .  according to the contract   _comma_   we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments  .  we ’ ll send our technicians to repair them  .  
 forty faulty instruments means that   % are not up to the standard  .  you should compensate us for   % of the total account on the contract   _comma_   as well as for the inspection fee  .  
 i am sorry about the quality problem   _comma_   but i propose we compensate you for   % of the total value apart from the inspection fee  .  
 all right  .  in that case we are still willing to do business with you  .  
hi bill   _comma_   i saw your grandma yesterday  .  
 oh where was that ? 
 i was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track  .  
 grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy  .  she is always making us kids eat the proper foods  .  
 well   _comma_   it pays off for her  .  how old is she anyway ? 
 she will be    next month  .  
 that is truly amazing ! 
did you punch in ? 
 yes  .  by the way   _comma_   you are having a great make up today  .  i like the color of your lipstick  .  so adorable ! 
 really ? it took me really a while to find the color  .  i am happy you like it  .  
 well    _comma_    girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things  .  actually    _comma_    do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? 
 sure   _comma_   when those never ending meetings  .  
i don t think you ve met my sister   _comma_   mary  .  
 no   _comma_   i haven t had the pleasure  .  
 come and meet her now  .  
 all right  .  
excuse me   _comma_   would you tell me how to return to hilton hotel  .  i m afraid i lost my way  .  
 did you have hotel card or something ? 
 let me see  .  yes   _comma_   i have the address and hotel telephone number here  .  
 oh    _comma_    you stay at the down town hilton  .  when you go down two blocks this way and turn left    _comma_    you will find it on your right  .  
 i don t understand very well  .  could you give me a map ? 
the bathroom looks lovely  .  did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? 
 i did it myself  .  i went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement  .  then i went to diy shop and bought everything i needed  .  i ’ m sure i saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too  .  i learnt a lot by doing it myself  .  
 so      _comma_      let ’ s see  .  you have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls  .  you ’ ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries  .  the bath      _comma_      shower      _comma_      and washbasin are the same as before      _comma_      aren ’ t they ? 
 yes   _comma_   they are  .  i gave them a good clean  .  they are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced  .  
 how long did it take you to do the tiling  .  
 as i hadn ’ t done it before    _comma_    i had to keep referring to income  ation i got from the internet  .  doing the floor tiles took a whole day from early morning to right through to the evening  .  then i spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles  .  putting the cupboard up took about an hour    _comma_    so it took me two days altogether  .  
 i think you ’ ve done a very good job  .  as least as good as a professional would do  .  perhaps i can convince you to redo my bathroom ? 
 you ’ ll be lucky ! however   _comma_   i ’ ll print out the income  ation i got from the internet and you can do it yourself  .  
i d like to see that pen   _comma_   please  .  
 you mean this one ? 
 no   _comma_   the other one in the brown case  .  
 oh   _comma_   this one  .  here  .  
 may i try it ? 
 sure  .  
 it s very smooth  .  i ll take it  .  
 cash or charge ? 
 charge   _comma_   please  .  
i ’ ve come to hear about your offer for bristles  .  
 we have the offer ready for you  .  let me see  .  here it is  .      cases houston bristles      _comma_         mm      _comma_      at    pounds sterling per kilogram      _comma_      c  .  i  .  f european main ports      _comma_      for shipment in june       .  the offer is valid for five days  .  
 why   _comma_   your price has soared  .  it ’ s almost    % higher than last year ’ s  .  it would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price  .  
 i ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that  .  you know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months  .  the price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere  .  
 i ’ m afraid i can ’ t agree with you there  .  i must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ ve received from other sources  .  
 but you must take the quality into consideration  .  everyone in the trade knows that us ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries  .  
 i agree that yours are of better quality  .  but there ’ s competition from synthetic products   _comma_   too  .  you can ’ t very well ignore that  .  prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years  .  
 there ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses  .  that ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones  .  to be frank with you    _comma_    if it were not for the long   standing relationship between us    _comma_    we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price  .  
 well    _comma_    we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price  .  but i ’ ll have to try    _comma_    i suppose  .

 yes     _comma_     i went to cambridge  .  after graduation     _comma_     i started right away into the advertising industry  .  later     _comma_     i made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research  .  
 so   _comma_   what experience do you have ? 
 i have ten years marketing experience  .  this includes both entry level and management positions  .  in my last position   _comma_   i worked my way up to being director of the marking department  .  
 i can see that from your resume . your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company    _comma_    is that right ? later    _comma_    why did you decide to leave your former post ? 
 i felt after five years in one place     _comma_     i was ready for something new  .  i would like to have a job that is challenging     _comma_     something that i can see and do new things every day  .  i loved many things about my former job     _comma_     and i left with amiable feelings on both sides  .  i was just ready for something new  .

 how much do are you looking to spend ? 
 i can only afford about    _comma_      yuan a month  .  
 looks like you ll have to get a place in the suburbs  .  
 it doesn t matter   _comma_   but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route  .  
 anything you need to have in the place ? 
 i want a bedroom with full bath   _comma_   and it ll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side  .  
 you can also check out university bulletin boards  .  
 why ? will those be students who are leaving ? 
 not really   _comma_   but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent  .  
 thank you  .  i ll be sure to take a look  .  
 good luck  .  
excuse me   _comma_   but can i draw on my account for payment of things i buy in china ? 
 certainly   _comma_   sir  .  how much do you draw ? 
 rib     _comma_          _comma_    please  .  would you please tell me my balance ? 
 yes    _comma_    sir  .  your balance is rib      _comma_        .

 you know     _comma_     a little piece of chocolate here     _comma_     some chips on the side     _comma_     candy now and then  .  
 i get what you mean  .

 that is good  .  and here i give you a piece of advice  .  you should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item  .  besides    _comma_    it s better to secure the cartons with metal straps  .  what s more    _comma_    the order number wasn t anywhere on some of the boxes  .  
 i realize that now  .  i will do that after a while  .  
 thank you  .  can i open the packages to check the color and style ?

 you know   _comma_   we are superior to other clothes companies  .  
 yes    _comma_    that s for sure  .  there is nothing wrong with the quality  .  i think you d better pack them first in plastic bags    _comma_    than in cartons  .

hello   _comma_   mr  .  thomas  .  could you spare a minute ? 
 what do you need ? 
 i need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ ve hired  .  i think i am going to have some problems working with him  .  
 he seems to be quite qualified  .  if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves  .  
i can t stand the stupid guy any longer  .  it   s unbelievable ! 
 oh   _comma_   my dear lady  .  take it easy  .  you should forgive a green hand like him  .  
 he does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy  .  
 i suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems  .  
 i have told him how to do it several times   _comma_   but he s never listened to me  .  
 maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss  .  
 oh   _comma_   i always have difficulty in getting along with the staff  .  
 just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do   _comma_   make sure you don t lose your temper  .  
 i think that s a bad idea  .  i d hate anyone here to think of me as a friend  .  how would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? 
 i disagree  .  all you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions  .  
hey   _comma_   you look great ! how s everything ? 
 yeah   _comma_   you know what ? i ve been going to the club regularly  .  the training really pays off  .  now i am in a good shape and i know more about how to keep fit  .  
 really ? tell me about it  .  i haven t gone to the club for a long time  .  i am too busy with work  .  
 it s important to do proper exercises  .  
 you re right  .  too much or too little won t do any good  .  
 the trainer tells me    _comma_    besides regular sports activities    _comma_    i should also have a healthy and balanced diet  .  
 sounds reasonable  .  
 we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic  .  
 and fruits ! 
 surely it is  .  getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness  .  
 i ve heard that  .  does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ? 
 yeah   _comma_   he advises me to stay in a good mood  .  that can help one to keep sound physical health  .  
 i think if you follow your trainer s advice   _comma_   you ll be on the right track  .  
 you bet it ! 
staying out all night   _comma_   you frightened me to death  .  
 i stayed with my friends  .  
 you should at least give me a call  .  
 i m sorry   _comma_   mum  .  
did anyone call ? 
 just mr  .  white  .  
 what did he want ? 
 he wouldn t say over the phone  .  
what kind of job do you intend to do ? 
 i want to do some management job since i have three year s work history  .  
 what are your plans if you were hired ? 
 i would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company  .  
you stepped on my foot ! 
 sorry  .  i didn t mean to  .  
what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ? 
 while i think it s great that they re trying to get people to quit smoking   _comma_   but i don t really care for the advertisement  .  
 why not ? 
 the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing ! 
 it s a pun  .  they use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking  .  
 i know   _comma_   but i think it s not really appropriate for young children  .  
 i think they re trying to scare the young people so that they don t ever start smoking  .  
 all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty  .  
 perhaps you re right    _comma_       _comma_    though  .  maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow  .  
 i have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults   _comma_   but i don t think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them  .  
 that s a good point  .  i think i was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that i didn t think about how children might understand the ad  .  
 you have to give them credit   _comma_   though  .  it s about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking  .  
good morning  .  could i speak with mr  .  willard please ? 
 this is he  .  who ’ s calling   _comma_   please ? 
 this is chris emerson speaking  .  
 hello   _comma_   chris  .  how can i help you ? 
can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum   _comma_   miss thong ? 
 certainly  .  a letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted  .  a memorandum is a communication within an organization  .  
 should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ? 
 no   _comma_   not necessary  .  usually we have a set form which is printed  .  we just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company  .  
 of course   _comma_   let me find one for you  .  
hi   _comma_   do you have any tickets for the show tonight ?

 certainly  .  
lily   _comma_   i am terribly sorry about this  .  but we have to put off or cancel tomorrow s meeting  .  
 cancelled ? that s just can t happen ! 
 sorry to say   _comma_   but nothing can be done  .  the equipment broke down and can t be fixed till friday  .  
 oh   _comma_   i hope it be fixed on friday  .  
overseas operator   _comma_   may i help you ? 
 yes  .  i would like to place a collect call  .  
 can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ? 
 terry and his number is            .  
 please wait a moment  .  it will take a few seconds to get through  .  
would you help me figure out what to do about the office party ? 
 i would be happy to help  .  what would you like me to help with   _comma_   food or entertainment ? 
 i would like to help you with both  .  
 that will work out fine  .  to make sure everything goes together   _comma_   do you think this party should be casual or dressy ? 
 a dressy party would be fun ! 
 that will work out fine  .  do you think that chinese or continental food would be best ? 
 we should probably have both  .  
 yes   _comma_   that will work out fine  .  should we hire a band or bring in a dj ? 
 maybe we could do both ! 
 everything sounds great then ! i ll meet you back here on friday to discuss the details  .  
i can t find the price tag  .  
 it s right here  .         .  
 but i heard other stores were having great mark downs on this item  .  
 ours are of really good quality  .  
 i see   _comma_   please wrap it  .  
peter   _comma_   how often do you exercise ? 
 well   _comma_   i swim and run every day  .

 what do you drink ? 
where can i call a taxi ? 
 there s a taxi rank over there   _comma_   right outside the gate  .  
how did your company s fundraiser go ? 
 the fundraiser events went really well  .  we were able to partner with a few of our competitors     _comma_     all in fun of course     _comma_     to sponsor a marathon for the american cancer society  .  all of the people who participated it had a great time     _comma_     and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research  .  
 so how does it work ? how were you able to make money with the marathon ? 
 each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee  .  also   _comma_   they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran  .  all in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars  .  
 sounds like a great deal for the american cancer society  .  
 in all honesty    _comma_    it s also a great deal for our company  .  the exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community  .  we accomplished as much as last year s advertising campaign    _comma_    plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause  .  
how may i help you today ? 
 i need to open a second account  .  
 what kind of account would you like to open ?

 have you ever been a student cadre ? 
 yes  .  i used to be the monitor of my class  .  
 did it affect you much ? 
 it ’ s a very important experience for me  .  first     _comma_     it improved my organizing ability     _comma_     and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective  .  second     _comma_     it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who i like or dislike  .  
 in your spare time   _comma_   do you have any part time jobs ? 
 yes   _comma_   i used to work as an assistant lawyer for tienda law office  .

i see you have bought the latest copy of “ beauty and fashion ”  .  are there any interesting articles in it ? 
 there ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions  .  i enjoyed reading her thought  .  the “ which ? ” section is very interesting this month  .  they tested facial cleaners  .  the article recommends “ all clear ” for effectiveness and price  .  
 i like to take the tests that they print in this magazine  .  
 which tests do you mean ? 
 you know  .  tests like ” how jealous are you ? ” and “ are you a fashion victim ? ” 
 oh     _comma_     i see  .  i like to do those tests     _comma_     too     _comma_     but i don ’ t take them seriously  .  
 of course not    _comma_    but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do  .  according to the jealousy test    _comma_    i ’ m quite a jealous type of person  .  perhaps i need to control my jealousy  .

good morning    _comma_    mr zhang    _comma_    i wonder whether you have got an answer from your superior  .  
 yes   _comma_   we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon  .  
 what s the answer ? 
 we decided that we could agree to your price   _comma_   but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery  .  
 let me see  .  i quoted your delivery in three months   _comma_   didn t i ? 
 yes   _comma_   but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible  .  
 i thought you would be worried about it  .  so i rang auckland last night  .  as you are our biggest customer   _comma_   they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave auckland next month  .  
 good   _comma_   if you agree we ll draft the agreement right away and sign it then  .  
 by all means  .  
be careful  .  the floor is wet  .  
 what happened ? 
 i spilled my drink  .  
hello    _comma_    this is lucie jing calling from lincoln bank  .  may i speak to mr was    _comma_    please ?

 sending it won t be necessary  .  i m actually coming in for a meeting with my personal banker this afternoon  .  
 what perfect timing ! 
 indeed  .  is there anything i need to do before i collect it ? 
 not really  .  but we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card   _comma_   just in case there is something you aren t happy with  .  
 i m sure it ll be fine  .  how about my pin number ? 
 that will be sent on to you within   working days  .  then   _comma_   you can start using your new card  .  
 great  .  i ll be in later today  .  thanks for calling  .  bye  .  
what are we eating for lunch ? 
 i have no idea  .  what about you ? 
 i kind of want pizza  .  
 i ate pizza the other day  .  
 so   _comma_   what do you feel like eating then ? 
 how about some burgers ? 
 i already had a burger yesterday  .  
 what are we going to do ? 
 we can just each get what we want to get  .  
 that sounds like a plan  .  
 do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ? 
 i think they sell both at the cafeteria  .  
did you bring your certificate for nursing ? 
 yes   _comma_   here is my certificate of nurse  .  
 how about your nursing education ? 
 i learnt nursing through theory and practice for   years at hunan nursing school  .  
 can you manage english conversation ? 
 yes   _comma_   pretty well  .  i have started learning english since primary school  .  
have you ever thought about having children   _comma_   kaitlyn ? 
 my husband and i have thought about it     _comma_     but we ve decided not to have any  .  they re just too expensive  .  besides     _comma_     with all the news about global warming on the news lately     _comma_     who knows what kind of worl 
 well    _comma_    i ve always wanted to have lots of children  .  growing up with only one brother    _comma_    i always felt a bit lonely  .  what do you think about families with only one child ? 
 for me   _comma_   growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention  .  i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn t ever have to share  .  
 don t you think you would miss having other people around ? 
 no way ! i spent    years of my life with relatives around me       .  you know   _comma_   i don t think i ve ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents   home  .  what do you think fo the one child policy 
 if china didn t have such a policy   _comma_   can you imagine how many people there would be in china now ? 
 that s true  .  but as a woman     _comma_     i m glad that even though i don t want any children     _comma_     i at least have a choice in how many children i have  .  on the other hand     _comma_     i can t imagine what china would be like 
 do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? 
 i don t know what other people think     _comma_     but i     _comma_     for one     _comma_     envy only children ! 
ok   _comma_   let ’ s go through this one more time  .  i don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! 
 i know    _comma_    i know  .  ok    _comma_    so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine  .  
 right  .  you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing  .  for example for delicates    _comma_    you should set a shorter washing cycle  .  also    _comma_    be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing  .  
 so complicated ! ok   _comma_   what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ? 
 since this is a white t shirt   _comma_   you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick  .  
 cool  .  then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? 
 no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton   _comma_   you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes  .  
 you know what ? i ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned  .  
is tom in ? 
 no   _comma_   he is at work now  .  
 may i have his office phone number please ? 
 sure  .  it s      _comma_        .  
what about driving to shanghai ? 
 driving ? no way   _comma_   it s too far  .  
 i just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places  .  how long will it take ? 
 too long   _comma_   and you do not have much time  .  
 what a pity  .  
good afternoon  .  i ll show you to your room  .  
 thank you  .  
 could you tell me which bags are yours ? 
 they re over there next to the door  .  those three with green tags on them  .  
 could you wait a moment ? i have to get a trolley  .  may i see your room key   _comma_   please ? 
 sure   _comma_   here it is  .  
 thank you  .  room      .  you re on the  th floor  .  this way   _comma_   please  .  
excuse me   _comma_   sir  .  is there anything i can do for you ? 
 yes  .  i bought the can two days ago   _comma_   but today i found that is beyond the guarantee period  .  
 let me see  .  i am sorry   _comma_   sir  .  we will change another one for you  .  please wait a moment  .  
excuse me   _comma_   but could you tell me the way to the railway station ? 
 the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner  .  the station is at the end of that street  .  
 how long will it take me to get there ? 
 it s about a ten minute walk  .  
 that s very clear  .  i think i can find my way now  .  thank you  .  
 not at all  .  
excuse me ! does this bus go to the railway station ? 
 no   _comma_   you re got on the wrong bus  .  you can take a no  .     bus at the university station and then transfer to a no  .     bus at the railway station  .  
 ok ! thank you very much ! 
i have here our price sheet on a f  .  o  .  b  .  basis  .  the prices are given without engagement  .  
 good    _comma_    if you ’ ll excuse me    _comma_    i ’ ll go over the sheet right now  .  
 take your time  .  
 i can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high  .  
 i ’ m surprised to hear you say so  .  you know that the cost of pro   duction has been skyrocketing in recent years  .  
 we only ask that your prices be comparable to others  .  that ’ s reasonable   _comma_   isn ’ t it ? 
 well      _comma_      to get the business done      _comma_      we can consider making some concessions in our price  .  but first      _comma_      you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us      _comma_      so that we may adjust our prices accordingly  .  
 the size of our order depends greatly on the prices  .  let ’ s settle that matter first  .  
 well     _comma_     as i ’ ve said     _comma_     if your order is large enough     _comma_     we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by   percent  .  
 when i say your prices are much too high   _comma_   i don ’ t mean they are higher merely by   or   percent  .  
 how much do you mean then ? can you give me a rough idea ? 
 to have this business concluded   _comma_   i should say a reduction of least    percent would help  .  
 impossible  .  how can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? 
 i think you are as well   informed as i am about the market for chemical fertilizers  .  it ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup   ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet  .  may i suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? 
 very well   _comma_   i will  .  
excuse me   _comma_   you look lost . can i help you ? 
 oh   _comma_   thank you  .  i m looking for the train station  .  
 right  .  let me see  .  you go straight down here and turn right  .  
 right ? ok   _comma_   got it  .  
 then take the next left then the next right  .  are you with me ? 
 next left then right ? ok  .  
i m sorry   _comma_   but i didn t catch what you said  .  
 i said   _comma_     do you want me to help you ?   
 i m trying to find a post office  .  
 go three blocks and turn right  .  it s right there  .  
 should i take the bus ? 
 no  .  it ll only take about five minutes to walk  .  
 thank you very much  .  
 anytime  .  
it says here that you graduated from beijing normal university with a major in english language and literature  .  
 right  .  then you may think that i am not fit for this job according to my educational background  .  
 yes  .  
 but i want to be a tour guide very much because i like traveling and meeting various kinds of people  .  so i took an evening course at the tourism school of beijing after graduation and i have gotten a qualification certificate  .  
 so you must be an extravert ? 
 yes   _comma_   i always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them  .  
 what do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ? 
 a tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities      _comma_      and offering service of transportation      _comma_      accommodation      _comma_      sightseeing      _comma_      shopping and entertainment  .  
 don t you consider it a hard work ? 
 hard but interesting   _comma_   i think  .  
 have you any experience as a tourist guide ? 
 yes   _comma_   i usually guided foreign tourists around beijing when i was in university  .  
 have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than english ? 
 yes   _comma_   i have learned a little french and japanese as well  .  
didn ’ t you punch in this morning   _comma_   monica ? 
 sorry   _comma_   i don ’ t know the rule about punching  .  
 that ’ s ok  .  i should have told you earlier  .  this is a company rule  .  
 do we also need to punch out after work ? 
 according to the company rule   _comma_   we should punch in before   o ’ clock and punch out after   o ’ clock every work day  .  
 how about the lunch break   _comma_   lucy ? 
 from    thirty to   o ’ clock  .  
 may i ask whether we need to work overtime ? 
 sometimes   _comma_   but not quite often  .  
this needs dry cleaning . can you remove this stain without harming the fabric ? 
 let me see  .  we ’ ll try   _comma_   but i ’ m not sure that we can remove it  .  
 ok   _comma_   then  .  we ’ ll i ’ d also like to have this pressed  .  
 any starch ? 
 no starch  .  
what s the problem ? 
 i have a laceration on my left forearm  .  
 let me have a look  .  how did this happen ? 
 i got hit by a car in an accident  .  
 was there much bleeding afterward ? 
 no   _comma_   not much  .  
 well    _comma_    this doesn t look too serious  .  nurse    _comma_    could you please get me a suture set ? 
 will i need stitches ? 
 yes  .  three     _comma_     i think  .  it wont   be too painful  .  alright     _comma_     we re done  .  that wasn t so bad     _comma_     was it ? 
 no   _comma_   not really  .  
 you re lucky there was no lasting damage  .  i ll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days  .  we ll take those stitches out then  .  so long  .  
 thank you   _comma_   doctor  .  bye  .  
what time is it ? 
 ten to nine  .  
 your watch is ten minutes slow  .  so it s should be nine sharp  .  i m gonna be late again  .  what will be my excuse this time ? it should be set the alarm for seven thirty  .

good afternoon    _comma_    sir  .  you re here to see about a temporary loan    _comma_    right ? the loans we offer are for purchasing income generating assets  .  is that what you require ? 
 yes   _comma_   that s exactly what i need  .  how about terms for these ? 
 well   _comma_   we offer      day or      day loans  .  the balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period  .  
 is there any flexibility on that ? 
 unfortunately   _comma_   not  .  
 ok  .  in my position   _comma_   i think the best way to go would be for the      day loan  .  that would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan  .  
 not a problem     _comma_     sir  .  if you d just fill out these forms     _comma_     and of course with necessary clearance     _comma_     we can get you the money right away  .

hi   _comma_   i would like to return this tv  .  
 sure   _comma_   do you have the receipt ? 
 yeah here you go  .  actually i also want to return this keyboard  .  
 ok  .  may i ask what is the reason for returning these products ? 
 the tv flickers a lot when i am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear  .  
 i see   _comma_   and what about the keyboard ? 
 i spilled some coffee on it and now it won t work  .  
 i am sorry mam    _comma_    but we can only exchange or refund defective products    _comma_    we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages  .  
 fine ! i don t know why they make these things so delicate anyways  .  
there are so many people that the tickets are all sold out ! 
 luckily we got the last two  .  
 look   _comma_   danny  .  the four great inventions ! 
 gunpowder     _comma_     compass     _comma_     the paper making     _comma_     and the printing  .  
 i really admire those who made such great inventions ! 
 may   _comma_   i don t see why they are great  .  they are just simple things  .  
 they look simple today  .  but they were milestones in their times  .  
 milestones ? may   _comma_   you must be kidding  .  
 just think bill gates   _comma_   those inventions are as important as the windows system  .  
 well   _comma_   i suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them  .  
 no   _comma_   quite the contrary  .  
 why ? didn t you say that they were milestones ? 
 yes   _comma_   but they went to the public without any patent protection  .  
 well   _comma_   their inventors were not as clever as bill gates  .  
what can i do for you ? 
 i need some medicine  .  
 for whom ? 
 my wife  .  she suffers from a bad cold  .  
 what symptoms does she have ? 
 fever and a bad cough  .  
 i see  .  don t worry   _comma_   just a common cold  .  
 what kind of medicine does she need ? 
 patulin will be enough  .  
 how many pills for each time ? 
 nine pills per day   _comma_   and three pills after each meal  .  
 thank you very much  .  
 it s my pleasure  .  
do you believe in god ? 
 not at all  .  i ’ m an agnostic  .  do you ? 
 i ’ m not sure  .  why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? 
 i think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one  .  
 i basically believe in science over theology  .  i mean    _comma_    i believe in evolution for example  .  however    _comma_    there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet  .  
 i ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually  .  i think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong  .  
 for example ? 
 religions preach tolerance   _comma_   but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics  .  
 yes  .  such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs  .  
didn t you say your friend was american ? where is she going on her honeymoon ? 
 they re going skiing in colorado  .  
 what a coincidence ! these pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon ! 
 you re probably right  .  oh    _comma_    what the heck ! i ll take it all  .  in maroon    _comma_    like you said  .  
what a terrible house ! 
 i m sick of it   _comma_   too  .  
 the door bell doesn t work    _comma_    there s no hot water    _comma_    and the building is falling apart  .  
 it s no use complaining  .  if we had got enough money    _comma_    we couldn t put up with it    _comma_    and would have moved out  .  
 sure  .  
hello ! 
 is that sue ? 
 speaking  .  
 a . this is george  .  
 hello   _comma_   george . what   s up ? 
this website offers very convenient air tickets booking service  .  it is quick and accurate  .  
 yes     _comma_     i once booked there  .  they give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e mail  .  you can conveniently pay by credit card     _comma_     so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes  .  they also provide e tickets     _comma_     meaning you don ’ t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket  .  you go to the airport directly and check in with your id card  .  
 so it has attracted more and more customers these days  .

 i agree  .

 yes       _comma_       we do  .  you ll go through the acceptance application       _comma_       then a first review       _comma_       then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval  .  why don t you read through this brochure ? it outlines all of the important aspects of the loan       _comma_       the terms and conditions       _comma_       etc  .

 that s ok  .  is anything else recommended ? 
 do you have any special request ? 
 i d like to see some traditional arts  .  
 so that means you are shopping for presents ? 
 yes   _comma_   i m just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends  .  
 actually    _comma_    i think the paper cuts is ok    _comma_    because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it  .  they think that is a miracle  .  
 sounds good  .  i ll take paper cut  .  
 i have collected different kinds of paper cuts all over the country   _comma_   you can pick the one you like best  .  
 you collect them yourself ? i think that you are just doing the wholesale  .  
 as a matter of fact   _comma_   i open the shop because i m interested in the arts  .  i spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country  .  
 wow   _comma_   you are the expert on it  .

mr  .  black   _comma_   i   d like to take some time off  .  i   ve been feeling exhausted these days  .  
 that s no problem  .  let me see  .  you still have ten days annual leave left   _comma_   is that right ? 
 yes  .  i was wondering if i could take another two weeks off  .  
 that s long leave  .  how s your project coming along ? 
 the project i m in charged of now will be done by the end of this week  .  i d like to take my leave from next monday on  .  
 well   _comma_   all right  .  but you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave  .  
 thank you   _comma_   mr . black  .  there are no immediate projects coming up at the moment  .  mr . smith will be in charge during my absence  .  he is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients  .  
 great ! i hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed  .  
 i will  .  many thanks   _comma_   mr . black  .  
did you ever get a parking ticket ? 
 only a few  .  
 what s a few ? 
 i ve gotten six   _comma_   i think  .  
 did you pay your fines ? 
 of course i have  .  
 how much are the parking tickets ? 
 i think they re        .  
 that s expensive  .  
 i just got a parking ticket  .  
 you should probably pay the fine soon  .  
 i m going to pay it today  .  
are you doing anything right now   _comma_   diana ? 
 i am typing a report for the moment   _comma_   mr  .  robbins  .  anything i need to do ? 
 will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ? 
 is it urgent ? 
 yes   _comma_   this letter can t go into the mail any later than    .  it s about a contract  .  
 ok   _comma_   i am coming  .  
 please take a seat   _comma_   diana  .  have you got your spare pens and pencils ? 
 yes    _comma_    i have this time  .  but if i don t understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating    _comma_    can i ask you halfway ? 
 no    _comma_    i ’ d prefer not  .  i don t want any interruptions every other minute    _comma_    but you can ask me at the end of the letter  .  
 all right  .  i understand now  .  do you think i should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments  .  
 of course   _comma_   diana  .  you d better pay attention to the spelling when you type it  .  
 certainly i will    _comma_    mr  .  robbins  .  by the way    _comma_    may i use a window envelope ? 
 yes      _comma_      that s fine  .  now when you finish these      _comma_      i want you to put these cards in alphabetical order      _comma_      using the last names      _comma_      and then make a list  .  
 you want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ? 
 right  .  and the last thing   _comma_   we are going to clean the files out tomorrow  .  now let s begin  .  
you re finally here ! what took so long ? 
 i got stuck in traffic again  .  there was a terrible traffic jam near the carrefour intersection  .  
 it s always rather congested down there during rush hour  .  maybe you should try to find a different route to get home  .  
 i don t think it can be avoided   _comma_   to be honest  .  
 perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work  .  
 i think it s something that i ll have to consider  .  the public transport system is pretty good  .  
 it would be better for the environment   _comma_   too  .  
 i know  .  i feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city  .  
 taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well  .  
 the only problem is that i m going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car  .  
 well    _comma_    when it s nicer outside    _comma_    you can start biking to work  .  that will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides  .  
 that s true  .  i could certainly use the exercise ! 
 so   _comma_   are you going to quit driving to work then ? 
 yes   _comma_   it s not good for me or for the environment  .  
that s really convenient  .  we were wondering if you could take a little off the rent   _comma_   though  .  
 i can take two thousand off  .  that ll make the rent twenty eight thousand  .  
 that s great  .  every little bit counts  .  and we don t need the parking space  .  i guess we could rent it out  .  
 sure   _comma_   for at least three thousand per month  .  
 that ll bring the price down to twenty five  .  that s the price we were shooting for  .  
 i m glad  .  now   _comma_   there s a deposit fee of two month s rent  .  
hello  .  i sent out my laundry yesterday . aren   t they ready ? 
 they ll be ready by this afternoon  .  
 oh   _comma_   no ! i m leaving for japan at    this morning  .  
 is that right ? we re very sorry  .  
 i thought it was   the same day   service . anyway   _comma_   please do hurry  .  
 i m afraid we can t return it by    o clock  .  
 well     _comma_     then     _comma_     would you send it to japan     _comma_     please ? 
 yes   _comma_   we ll do so  .  
hello   _comma_   welcome to lincoln bank  .  what can we do for you today ? 
 i want to effect payment under an l   c today  .  
 no problem  .  ok  .  just checking for you  .  ah    _comma_    i m afraid there aren t enough funds in your account to cover this transaction  .  what you can do is buy some us dollars    _comma_    using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount  .  
 that seems alright  .  what s the exchange rate like today ? good or bad ? 
 it s not too bad today   _comma_   actually  .      .     .  
how can i help you   _comma_   sir ? 
 i am here to have a discussion on your company s investment issue  .  
 sorry   _comma_   could you tell me your name ? 
 i am james pond from fam company and i am here to discuss it with nova  .  
 do you have an appointment ? 
 yes   _comma_   i did it yesterday  .  our meeting should be   pm  .  
 i guess she forgot your meeting  .  she is attending an important meeting in the company  .  will you have a seat ? may i leave a memo for her ? 
 thank you  .  
 she will be back soon  .  
excuse me  .  would you please make a suit with this material ? 
 sure  .  may i take your measurements ? 
 please don t make it too tight  .  this is for autumn wear   _comma_   so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath  .  
 i see    _comma_    sir  .  can you come back for a fitting on the   th    _comma_    that s in a week s time ? 
 the   th ? i m sorry     _comma_     but you see i m going to attend an international conference on the   th  .  could you have the suit ready by the  th     _comma_     or at the latest     _comma_     the  th ? 
 well    _comma_    a business suit usually takes ten days   time  .  but in your case    _comma_    we ll try to have it ready sooner  .  how about coming for your fitting on the  th ? then your suit will be ready for you on the   th ? 
 that s fine   _comma_   thank you  .  
good morning everyone  .  thank you for attending the meeting today  .  i m sure you all have a copy of the agenda  .  so let s get started with the first issue  .  
 we re here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior  .  
 i would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right )      _comma_      we have mr  .  brown      _comma_      who is vice president of sales  .  next to him is ms  .  arts      _comma_      director of marketing for the atlas company  .  in the back row is dr  .  barolo      _comma_      who is visiting from italy  .  thank you all for coming  .  
 i am glad to see everyone is here and on time  .  let s get started ! susan   _comma_   toss out some of your ideas  .  
it seems that many boys are fighting there  .  
 break it up ! i will not permit fighting in this campus  .  
the air quality in this city is horrendous ! the pollution levels were so high that we weren t supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! 
 exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment  .  
 on top of that    _comma_    there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs    _comma_    which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city  .  
 as much as i love this city   _comma_   i think i m going to have to find a greener city to live in  .  living in a polluted city like this just can t be good for my health  .  
 i know what you mean  .  however      _comma_      there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming  .  if it s not the pollution      _comma_      then it s the natural disasters      _comma_      deforestation      _comma_      or the greenhouse 
 what is the greenhouse effect exactly ? 
 it s the gradual rise in the earth s temperature  .  
 i see   _comma_   so it s similar to global warming ? 
 they re related to one another   _comma_   yes  .  
 i heard that some people in england are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it s making their towns a more pleasant place to live  .  
 people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature   _comma_   but it s not all good news  .  they ve been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well  .  
 people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations  .  
 i think if everyone pitches in   _comma_   the world will be a better place  .

every honored guests   _comma_   welcome to hang thou  .  now we are visiting tiger running spring  .

the environment varies greatly because of difference in language   _comma_   customs and traditions  .  
 yes  .  this gap can be filled by export market research before exporting  .  
 but the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers  .  
 that s right  .  they do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury  .  
 therefore    _comma_    when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market    _comma_    they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount  .

 you may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank    _comma_    for example    _comma_    payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments  .  
 does that mean i should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ? 
 exactly  .  you are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank  .  
 that s very thoughtful of you  .  thank you so much  .  
 you re welcome  .

 we have those      _comma_      but i only sell them to people i know well      _comma_      for obvious reasons  .  how about a lizard ? i have some that are very brightly coloured      _comma_      are not aggressive      _comma_      and are easy to feed and look after  .  
 that sounds ideal  .  could you show me some ? 
 sure  .  come over here  .  as you can see    _comma_    i have a wide selection of species  .  they can live together    _comma_    if you want lizards of different kinds  .  do you have a favourite colour ? 
 i like the red one  .  what do they eat ? 
 you can feed them on various things  .  they will eat small pieces of meat    _comma_    but i ’ d recommend insects  .  you can get them from your garden    _comma_    but remember that lizards eat a lot insects  .  i sell them here  .

 so you re quite confident in your experience and skill 
 i think so  .

 i m afraid not   _comma_   unless you want a night flight  .  
 no   _comma_   exactly not 
 how about afternoon ? 
 sounds not good  .  i won t take it  .  
we have settled the question of price   _comma_   quality and quantity  .  now i am calling to talk about the terms of payment  .  what are your terms of payment ? 
 well  .  we only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable l \ c   _comma_   payable against shipping documents  .  
 i see  .  payment by lc is the safest method   _comma_   but could you make an exception and accept da or dp ? 
 i m afraid not  .  that is our usual practice   _comma_   because we are sure we will get the right amount of money that way  .  
 what about the cost of delivery ? 
 we would like to do it in accordance with an f  .  o  .  b  .  
what may i help you with ? 
 i need to file a complaint  .

 what was taken ? 
 my wallet and cell phone  .  
 did you get a good look at the person who robbed you ? 
 i sure did  .  
 would you able to pick him out of a line up ? 
 that shouldn t be a problem  .  
dad   _comma_   i ’ d like to borrow some money  .  
 sure    _comma_    johnny    _comma_    how much do you need ? five bucks ? 
 come on       _comma_       dad       _comma_       i need thirty thousand  .  i wanna get into the market  .  you know       _comma_       i ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn       _comma_       the inevitable recession       _comma_       people stuffing their money in their mattresses  .  i look at this as an opportunity  .  this is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg  .  
 i don ’ t know about that . with all the uncertainty in the markets right now     _comma_     it would be a very unwise decision to invest  .  i don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son     _comma_     but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently  .  there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months     _comma_     and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy  .  there ’ s just too much instability  .  i wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate  .  
 but look at it this way       _comma_       every challenge is an opportunity . and anyway       _comma_       i ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market  .  there are emerging markets that promise great returns  .  look at china       _comma_       for example . they have   .   billion people       _comma_       half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class  .  here alone       _comma_       the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity  .  
 come on      _comma_      son      _comma_      you ’ re looking at this too naively      _comma_      the chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability      _comma_      and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point  .  
 fine    _comma_    then ! if that ’ s the way you feel    _comma_    so be it  .  but you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here  .  i ’ m going to go hit up mum for the cash  .  
could you tell me a little about the organization ? for example   _comma_   how big is your workforce here ? 
 well in total we have around     employees based in hong kong with another     in our head office in beijing  .  the news desk staff in hong kong comprises around    staff  .  
 i see  .  and how about the working hours ? 
 well    _comma_    as you know rebecca    _comma_    in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five  .  you could be on call at any time  .  we do have to work very unsociable hours at times  .  
 well i am used to that    _comma_    mr  .  parsons    _comma_    so that ’ s not really a shock for me  .  
 good   _comma_   as long as you understand that  .  
 and when do you need to fill the vacancy   _comma_   mr  .  parsons ? 
 yesterday ! but no   _comma_   we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month  .  
 that sounds ideal  .  
smells good ! what ’ s for breakfast ? 
 well    _comma_    since we are getting up so late    _comma_    i decided to make a big breakfast ! 
 nice ! brunch ! 
 kind of    _comma_    so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs    _comma_    some french toast and buttermilk pancakes ! 
 wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ? 
 yeah   _comma_   just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light  .  
 looks good ! i ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice  .  
 get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don ’ t forget the syrup !

 yes    _comma_    that ’ s the price they were advertising it at  .  i was hoping it might go on sale soon  .  why    _comma_    how much did you pay for it ? 
 i bought it for one hundred and forty five dollars at helen ’ s boutique  .  i didn ’ t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else  .  
 of course ! everything at helen ’ s is overpriced   _comma_   and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! why didn ’ t you shop around ? 
 i don ’ t know   _comma_   i just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much i wanted it  .  i guess i was too impulsive  .

 yes   _comma_   it ’ s a really nice neighborhood  .  
now darling    _comma_    i know that we ve bought this house together    _comma_    but it s just going to be far too expensive to decorate it  .  i think we should sell it  .  
 oh       _comma_       no       _comma_       nathan       _comma_       i  .  i really think we ve bought this flat at the right time       _comma_       you know . market prices are going to go up       _comma_       and i think you ll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more  .  
 but we re going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating  .  i think we could get a much cheaper place that s already furnished  .  
 but don t you like this place ? i remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely  .  
 well    _comma_    only you liked it really    _comma_    darling  .  
 oh   _comma_   why didn t you say so then ? but i still think we ve made a good buy  .  
hi    _comma_    bob    _comma_    everything okay ? 
 more or less  .  there s just one thing bothering me  .  
 oh ? what s that ? 
 well   _comma_   you know i have some students studying for their master s degree  .  one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy  .  
 what gift ? 
 it s an egyptian carpet  .  the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude  .  seeing what gift was    _comma_    i was really uncomfortable  .  i mean it s too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor  .  i don t think i ve done anything to deserve that gift    _comma_    so i refused it  .  
 you refused the gift ? that s terrible  .  
 i know    _comma_    but i really can t accept such an expensive gift  .  i explained to him why    _comma_    but he seemed really upset about it  .  i think he might have taken it the wrong way  .  
 perhaps  .  he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade  .  
 that s what i am worried about  .  i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored  .  but i really don t think it s proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor  .  i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page  .  
i ve been looking for a swimming pool   _comma_   but i haven t found one yet  .  
 we have no pool    _comma_    sir    _comma_    but we do have swim stations in our gym  .  
 swim stations ? could you be a little more explicit ? 
 you know how you run on a treadmill but don t go anywhere ? well   _comma_   it s the same thing  .  
 gee    _comma_    that s a great idea  .  now    _comma_    how much do i have to pay ? 
 the stations are absolutely free to guests   _comma_   sir  .  
 great ! now   _comma_   when can i go down there and use the stations ? 
 the swim stations are open daily from   a  .  m  .  to    p  .  m  .  
 boy   _comma_   oh boy ! i can t wait to change into my swim trunks  .  
 be warned   _comma_   sir  .  at certain hours the swim stations are very crowded  .

 yeah    _comma_    i guess so  .  i ve never actually heard of this one    _comma_    but  .  
 well       _comma_       it s small       _comma_       but it s a young       _comma_       dynamic       _comma_       rapidly growing company with a progressive       _comma_       humanistic philosophy  .

 four times  .  i m totally prepared  .  oh   _comma_   no ! i forgot to take off my nail polish ! and i have to be there in    minutes ! that s it  .  i blew it  .  
 well   _comma_   they are progressive and humanistic maybe they don t care about nail polish  .  uh  .  even blue nail polish  .  just keep your confidence up and you ll do great  .  
 but the competition is fierce this year  .  and it seems like i m the only one left who hasn t found a job  .

i m calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet  .  
 i m sorry   _comma_   hold on a moment  .  i ll check it out  .  but we have already shipped it to you last month  .  would you like us to contact the express company to know what s going on ?

 i haven t the slightest clue what i m going to make  .  
 a teriyaki bowl sounds nice  .  
 i don t know how to make that  .  
 all you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef  .  
 that sounds fairly simple   _comma_   but how do i cook it ? 
 the first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice  .  
 what s next ? 
 then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it  .  
 what s the next thing i need to do ? 
 then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy  .  
how do i submit an expense report ? 
 you need all your receipts for reimbursement  .

good morning  .  madam  .  what can i do for you today ? 
 hello  .  i hope you can help me ; i m a little worried about my new card  .  
 what seems to be the problem ? 
 i received my new card this morning   _comma_   but i m unable to use it  .  
 oh ? you mean   _comma_   the atm machine has eaten it ? 
 no    _comma_    it s right here    _comma_    see ? the atm will not accept it ! 
 you said you received your card this morning   _comma_   am i right ? 
 yes  .  i was told it would be activated and ready to use right away  .  so   _comma_   what s gone wrong ? 
 did you receive your pin number yet        _comma_        madam ? you see        _comma_        unless you have your new pin number        _comma_        to match your new card        _comma_        you cannot use it  .  we usually send that separately        _comma_        around one day after the card        _comma_        for security reasons  .  
 well   _comma_   that explains it  .  i ve been using my old pin number ! thanks for explaining everything to me  .  
can you manage chopsticks ? 
 why not ? see  .  
 good mastery  .  how do you like our chinese food ? 
 oh     _comma_     great ! it s delicious  .  you see     _comma_     i am already putting on weight  .  there is one thing i don t like however     _comma_     msg  .  
 what s wrong with msg ? it helps to bring out the taste of the food  .  
 according to some studies it may cause cancer  .  
 oh    _comma_    don t let that worry you  .  if that were true    _comma_    china wouldn t have such a large population  .  
 i just happen to have a question for you guys  .  why do the chinese cook the vegetables ? you see what i mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated  .  
 i don t know exactly  .  it s a tradition  .  maybe it s for sanitary reasons  .  
hi    _comma_    francis    _comma_    how was your business trip ? 
 it was a nightmare  .  
 what ’ s up ? 
 actually    _comma_    the business trip itself was very successful  .  we arrived on time    _comma_    we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year  .  
 sounds quite fruitful   _comma_   why do you call it still a nightmare then ? 
 well    _comma_    the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then i lost my carry on bag when i was tackling with the officers in charge  .  i left the airport three hours later than i expected and then i was caught in a traffic jam  .  when i finally got home    _comma_    i was totally exhausted  .  but i found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout  .  
 this is really a sad story  .  did they trace back your luggage ? 
 i am still waiting for their call  .  
 take it easy   _comma_   all sufferings have their reward  .  
do you have any seat preferences   _comma_   sir ? 
 yes   _comma_   could you put me in the no smoking section ? 
 yes  .  would you like a window seat ? 
 if one s available   _comma_   please  .  but not over the wing  .  
morning  .  rent a car agency  .  may i help you ? 
 good morning  .  this is paul alexander calling from the isis advertising firm  .  we need a car to the airport for mr  .  phillips  .  
 certainly   _comma_   mr  .  alexander  .  when would mr  .  phillips like to leave ? 
 let me check  .  his flight ’ s at  :   p  .  m  .    _comma_   so he should leave no later than    noon  .  
i m calling today about a bill that i never received  .  
 can you tell me which credit card it was for ? 
 it was for my master card  .  
 you should ve gotten that bill two weeks ago  .  
 i haven t got it in the mail yet  .  
 the computer is showing that all bills have been mailed  .  
 what am i supposed to do about my bill then ? 
 maybe you should call your post office  .  
 but if it s their mistake   _comma_   can i get an extension on my bill payment ? 
 yes   _comma_   but you will need to send us proof of their mistake  .  
 okay   _comma_   thank you very much for your help  .  
 not a problem  .  enjoy the rest of your day  .  
jenny   _comma_   don t you think it s really charming ? 
 yes  .  it s a feast of eyes to walking in the museum  .  
 let s take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum  .  
 what a shame that we can t take pictures  .  
ok   _comma_   allen  .  it s your turn  .  are you ready ? 
 i really would rather just listen  .  isn t there anyone else who wants to sing ? 
 come on ! in the two hours we ve been here you haven t sung even one song ! 
 i know    _comma_    but  .  hey    _comma_    stanley s here ! i ve been wanting to hear him sing all night  .  
 well   _comma_   you asked for it  .  why don t you put on an elvis song for him  .  he loves   the king  .    
 i ll put the song at the front of the list  .  
here is the document you asked for this morning  .  
 oh   _comma_   you are so efficient  .  i thought you might give it to me tomorrow  .  thanks  .  
 you ’ re welcome  .  you know    _comma_    these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination  .  the more i think about it    _comma_    the more i hate myself for being so disorganized  .  i decided to change the situation as soon as possible  .  otherwise i will be more regretful later  .  
 this is encouraging news    _comma_    good for you ! what is your solution    _comma_    then ? 
 the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities  .  it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place  .  
 sounds not bad ! better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more  .  it is about focusing on the right things to do  .  
how are you doing   _comma_   jim ? 
 fine   _comma_   just fine . how about you ? 
 not too bad  .  
i think your presentation impressed the client   _comma_   daniel  .  you did a good job  .  
 thank you   _comma_   mr  .  cooper  .  i hope we get the contract  .  
what s for lunch ? 
 pork chops  .  
what happened to you ? 
 i think i caught a cold  .  
 do you have any symptoms ? 
 runny nose and coughing  .  
 do you have a fever ? 
 i have just taken the temperature   _comma_   i don t think so  .  
 it s not serious  .  
 are you sure ? 
 yes  .  
 what should i do ? 
 you should drink more hot water   _comma_   and do some exercise  .  
what kind of place shall we rent ? 
 it should be close to the university  .  neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is   _comma_   the later we can get up  .  
 absolutely  .  that s the most important thing to take into consideration  .  i m not too worried about the size of the flat  .  
 neither am i  .  so a small place is ok   _comma_   but we ll get a bigger one if it s not expensive  .  do you mind if it s in a noisy area  .  
 i don t mind  .  i m not a light sleeper   _comma_   but quieter is better for when we have to study at home  .  
 good point  .  ok   _comma_   let s go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us  .  
 yes   _comma_   if we re lucky we ll find something in the next few days  .  i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early  .  
 how much do you think the rent will be ? 
 i asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month  .  
i don t think we can meet the delivery date you suggest  .  it s too soon  .  
 well   _comma_   is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of june ? 
 the earliest we can do is by the end of june  .  
did you have any working experience during college ? 
 yes     _comma_     i did some part time jobs such as english tutor     _comma_     salesman     _comma_     and model  .  
 what did you learn from your part time jobs ? 
 i learned to be patient   _comma_   professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales  .  
smells good ! what ’ s for breakfast ? 
 well    _comma_    since we are getting up so late    _comma_    i decided to make a big breakfast ! 
 nice ! brunch ! 
 kind of    _comma_    so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs    _comma_    some french toast and buttermilk pancakes ! 
 wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ? 
 yeah   _comma_   just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light  .  
 looks good ! i ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice  .  
 get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don ’ t forget the syrup ! 
can you tell me if there is a flight to new york ? 
 yes  .  flight db    departs at  :   pm and arrives in new york at  :   am with a layover in chicago  .  it also makes a refueling stop at colombia  .  
 so many stops ! don t you have any direct flights ?

would you like some more coffee ? 
 no thanks  .  i m full  .  we need to find our waitress and get our bill  .  
 the waitress is bringing the bill right now  .  
 this waitress has really been on top of things   _comma_   hasn t she ? 
 yes   _comma_   this waitress did a great job  .  
 ok   _comma_   let s see what the damage is  .  the total for our meal is      .     .  
 what do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ? 
 fifteen percent is a normal tip   _comma_   but she really did a great job  .  what do you think about    % this time ? 
 yes   _comma_      % would be perfect  .  
 her tip will end up being     .    plus the bill of      .     .  the total will be      .     .  
 yes   _comma_   that was one fantastic meal ! 
 i agree  .  maybe we can come back again next week  .  
it ’ s time for me to go now  .

 i ’ d rather you typed it  .

 i ’ d rather you told her  .

 i am innocent  .

 well    _comma_    to tell the truth    _comma_    i don t really feel like it tonight  .  i had a pretty hard day and i m sort of tired  .  
 hmm  .  well    _comma_    in that case    _comma_    we could go to the movies  .

what s our target audience for this campaign ? 
 this go around we re focusing on new moms   _comma_   families with median income and one or more children under the age of two  .  
 do you think that s much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? 
 well        _comma_        there are some similarities that come up  .  because both groups are made up of mothers  .  so as before        _comma_        we can play up on maternal instincts        _comma_        hygiene        _comma_        safety        _comma_        along those lines  .  but that being said        _comma_        there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here  .  
 right   _comma_   that makes sense  .  what s the average age ? 
 demographics say an average age of    .      _comma_    educational background of university or post grad    _comma_    annual household income of       k a year  .

 thanks for your help  .  
i miss grandma  .  i dreamed about her yesterday  .  
 dear   _comma_   let ’ s drop the subject  .  
good morning   _comma_   sir  .  can i help you ? 
 good morning  .  i d like to cash this check  .  
 yes   _comma_   sir  .  can you show you identity ? 
 what about the driving license ? 
 don t you have any other identification ? 
 i am sorry  .  i only have my driving license with me  .  
 ok  .  would you please sign your name on the back of the check ? 
 thank you  .  here you are  .  
 how do you want your money ? 
 would you give me some in twenties and tens ? 
 all right  .  please wait for a moment  .  
could you fill in this form   _comma_   please ? 
 all right  .  
 have you got any identification ? 
 yes   _comma_   here s my id card  .  
oh   _comma_   my god ! i ve been cheated ! 
 what ? what did you buy ? 
 it s a brick ! i can t believe how stupid i was  .  damn it ! 
 what is it ? why did you buy a brick ? 
 there was a guy on the sidewalk . he had three new boxes   _comma_   panasonic video camera boxes . he said he had to get rid of them quick  .  
 and ? 
 so he said he d sell me one for twenty dollars  .  a four hundred dollar camera for twenty bucks  .  
 and it s a brick ? 
 yes  .  
 i can t believe how stupid you are  .  why didn t you open the box ? 
 i wanted to  .  but he said     _comma_     no     _comma_     the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . if it s opened     _comma_     other people won t believe it s new  .  
 so he had the boxes wrapped in plastic  .  
 yes    _comma_    it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . look    _comma_    it even had a bar code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new  .  
 but why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
 he said he had to get rid of them  .  they were stolen  .  
 aha ! now i understand . you were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . so    _comma_    what i think is    _comma_    you deserve to get cheated ! 
 c mon   _comma_   don t blame me ! i thought it was a new camera  .  we could use it . we were even thinking about buying a camera  .  i don t understand how he could have such a perfect looking box  .  
 that s no problem . he just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap  .  that s easy . and probably it s the same shop he got the boxes from . maybe his friend works in an electronics store  .  they sell video cameras there . probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . so they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . twenty dollars a brick  .  that s a good profit if they can sell enough bricks  .  
 you re right   _comma_   sarah  .  i was a fool  .  i can t believe it  .  how could i fall for such a trick ? 
hello   _comma_   arthur  .  what seems to be the problem ? 
 hey doc  .  well    _comma_    i think i might need glasses  .  i ’ m getting headaches    _comma_    and i really struggle to see things that are far away  .  but i have always had       vision  .  
 sounds like you may be far sighted  .  ok    _comma_    then    _comma_    cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you  .  
 mmm  .   .  x       _comma_       e       _comma_       r       _comma_               _comma_       a question mark       _comma_       and i can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but i think it ’ s the peace sign  .  
 wow   _comma_   arthur ! you ’ re as blind as a bat ! 
 yeah    _comma_    i know    _comma_    my vision is really blurry at times  .  
 ok then   _comma_   head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while i fill out your prescription  .  
 thanks doc ! 
 arthur   _comma_   that ’ s the bathroom  .  
would you like some more coffee ? 
 no thanks  .  i m full  .  we need to find our waitress and get our bill  .  
 good luck finding the waitress ! 
 the service this evening has kind of sucked  .  is that our server over there ? 
 i ll go get the check   _comma_   since our server doesn t seem to be headed this way  .  
 good  .  i ll just stay here until you get back  .  
 so the total is      .    for our dinner  .  
 how much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ? 
 i wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service  .  
 i kind of feel the same way   _comma_   but they may have just been really short staffed tonight  .  
 i think that we should leave    %  .  
     .    will be the right amount for the tip  .  
i want to fly to congo on monday   _comma_   the   th  .

 take a guess  .  
a guy in my office got the flu the other day  .  today i seem to have come down with it   _comma_   too  .  
 very likely  .  you have a slight fever  .  do you have a headache   _comma_   too ? 
 yes  .  i wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon   _comma_   because i ll be on a business trip in two days  .  
 well   _comma_   you have to let your flu run its course  .  you must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest  .  usually it will take   to   days to make a full recovery  .  
 but i m going on a business trip in two days ! 
 maybe you ll have to cancel it or postpone it  .  if you go out while you are sick   _comma_   it won t help you recover  .  you may even pass your disease on to others  .  
would you care for a drink ? 
 no   _comma_   thanks  .  i m fine  .

come in   _comma_   arnold  .  have a seat  .  
 good morning  .  
 would you like something to drink ? 
 no   _comma_   thank you  .  i just had two cups of coffee at my desk  .  
 so   _comma_   you re a serious coffee drinker  .  
 yes   _comma_   it keeps me going  .  sometimes i think i m addicted  .  
 well    _comma_    coffee isn t such a bad thing . everyone has to have something . for me    _comma_    it s cigars  .  are you a cigar smoker ? 
 no   _comma_   i ve tried them  .  but i m not really a smoker  .  
 well   _comma_   what would you like to talk to me about ? 
 i wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal  .  
 i m glad when people have new ideas around here  .  tell me about it  .  
 it is about the staff meetings . you know how we have a staff meeting every tuesday  .  
 yes  .  
 well   _comma_   i have been thinking about it . and i believe we could do things more efficiently here  .  
 what do you suggest ? 
 the way it is now   _comma_   the staff from all four branches get together once a week . we meet for one hour  .  but i think a lot of time is wasted in transportation  .  
 you mean because people have to go across town to get here  .  
 yes  .  some people spend half of the morning on the road  .  
 that s true  .  but our staff meetings are very important   _comma_   arnold  .  i don t know how we can function without them  .  
 i think they are important too . that   s why i want people to have a better attitude about them  .  
 i know a lot of people think the meetings aren t too useful  .  i m aware of that  .  
 here s what i propose  .  i think we should meet once every two weeks   _comma_   but meet for ninety minutes or more  .  
 well  .  
 i also think the meetings should be more focused . and i would be willing to take responsibility for that  .  
 you mean you want to run the meetings ? 
 no     _comma_     not really run them  .  but i could help organize them  .  i could discuss meeting topics with you     _comma_     and then prepare a schedule for each meeting  .  i could then send an e mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting . this way the meetings would become more focused     _comma_     and people would prepare better  .  
 hmm  .  but we would meet every two weeks  .  
 i really think it would work . the meetings could be longer   _comma_   and better organized  .  
 i am not against the idea     _comma_     arnold . it may really be more efficient     _comma_     as you say  .  i ll tell you what we can do . why don t we try your proposal for a month     _comma_     and see how it works  .  
 excellent  .  i would be happy to get started on it  .  
 i will call the managers . then tomorrow i ll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this   new style  .

good afternoon miss    _comma_    would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? you know    _comma_    you can never get enough  .  
 i think my husband has some  .  
 are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? if something terrible happened with your husband    _comma_    and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance    _comma_    my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you  .  
 that ’ s true  .  if something happened to my husband     _comma_     i might lose everything  .  both of us have to work to keep our home     _comma_     car     _comma_     and our children ’ s education  .  i can ’ t afford that by myself  .  
 could we sit and look at the policy i mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ?

you look depressed  .  what s on your mind ?

 take it easy  .  when we last talked   _comma_   you promised there would be more exercises in your life  .  but now you are putting on some weight  .  
 i have to admit it s easier said than done  .  
 well   _comma_   i think it s time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle  .  regular exercise will improve your health  .  
 but you know i m just not into exercises  .  and i wouldn t have time for exercises   _comma_   either  .  
 you can do some jogging  .  it s easy and it doesn t take much time  .  
 actually   _comma_   my doctor said the same thing  .  
excuse me    _comma_    sir    _comma_    but you have to put your bags here before entering the market  .  
 oh  .  i am sorry  .  i was busy looking for some whisky . can you tell me the exactly place where i can find any ?

 it s been my pleasure to help you  .  
did you go and buy your bus pass ? 
 no   _comma_   i didn t  .  
 when are you going to go get it ? 
 i m not sure where they sell bus passes at  .  
 why didn t you just ask me ? 
 where should i go ? 
 you can get one from student services  .  
 i had no clue that i could get it there  .  
 i already knew that  .  
 thanks for letting me know  .  
 you re welcome  .  
 i m going to go and get it right now  .  
tomorrow is my first day at work   _comma_   what do you think i should be wearing ? 
 well       _comma_       if you want to look professional       _comma_       serious and more conservative       _comma_       a blue dress       _comma_       white shirt and not too high shoes would be the best choice  .  but sometimes       _comma_       very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues  .  it depends on the company ’ s dress code  .  
 indeed    _comma_    i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview  .  only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony  .  it seems that their dress code is not that formal  .  probably    _comma_    i should put on car key and simple shirt  .  
 whatever you choose   _comma_   make sure they are neat and clean  .  
excuse me  .  will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? i just want to make a phone call  .  
 certainly   _comma_   but will it take long ? 
 no   _comma_   i ll be right back  .  
 ok  .  i ll look after it then  .  
mike s mechanics  .  can i help you ? 
 yes   _comma_   how do i get to your shop from chilin ? 
 go straight up zhongshan road and you will see our sign on your right   _comma_   after you pass the museum  .  
 thank you very much  .  
don t take too much off  .  i m trying to grow my hair longer  .  
 how about two inches ? 
 that sounds perfect  .  do you think i can get some highlights today   _comma_   too ? i ve always wanted red  .  
 i think that will over process your hair   _comma_   you should wait at least two weeks  .  
 all right  .  i ll just have the cut and perm today  .  
 great  .  my assistant will wash your hair   _comma_   and then i ll be back to help you  .  
 ok  .  
oh   _comma_   damn  .  there ’ s another traffic jam on the highway  .  
 how can there be a traffic jam on a      lane highway every day ? 
 there are just too many people   _comma_   and too many cars  .  
 i wonder if there was an accident  .  
 no   _comma_   they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the capitol exits  .  
 well   _comma_   let ’ s put on some music  .  we ’ re going to be stuck in this for a while  .

 that s so convenient  .  where are the dirty clothes ? 
 they are in the basement already  .  
 but i didn t see you carry them down  .  
 don t you know that we have a laundry chute in the house ? 
hi   _comma_   john  .  
 oh     _comma_     hi     _comma_     mary     _comma_     come on in  .  any problem ? 
 oh   _comma_   no problem  .  
 great  .  i forgot to ask you   _comma_   though  .  how long did you want the place ? 
 six months  .  
 oh    _comma_    well    _comma_    that might be a problem  .  i usually only sign one year leases  .  
 well    _comma_    one year would be fine    _comma_    too  .  i ’ m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon  .  
 well   _comma_   if it ’ s not a problem  .  then here you go  .  
 just let me look at it quickly  .  
 of course  .  
 looks like a standard lease  .  
 yeah    _comma_    and don ’ t worry about the security deposit  .  if everything ’ s all right when you move out    _comma_    you ’ ll get it back  .  
 o  .  k  .  great  .  just sign and date it here ?

you look fresh recently  .  and  .  what s your weight now ? 
     pounds  .  
 really ? congratulations ! that s really something beyond my imagination  .  how did you make it ? did you keep on a diet ? 
 no   _comma_   you know i can t bear eating less  .  
 then do the slim pills take effect on you ? 
 i ve quit it already  .  i go to aerobics class everyday instead  .  
 how s it going on ? 
 you see  .  i ve lost my weight in spite of my good appetite  .  
 i d better exercise my body too  .  my limbs are rusty now  .  
 i don t think so  .  you look full of energy every day  .  time has stood still with you  .  
 thank you  .  
ahhs ! i m beat ! 
 what happened to you ? you look like you got hit by a tornado ! 
 i just got back from fighting the crowds  .  
 you mean at the mall ? was there a sale ? 
 yeah  .  for five minutes   _comma_   everything was half off  .  it was total chaos  .  
 cool ! 
 grabbing   _comma_   pushing and shoving  .  
thank god you are open ! i have an emergency ! 
 hello   _comma_   mr  .  henderson what can i do for you ? 
 i need this dress and this suit dry cleaned asap ! 
 ok   _comma_   i can have it ready by the end of the week  .  
 no    _comma_    you don ’ t understand    _comma_    i need this tomorrow morning ! i accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ’ s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! she ’ s gonna kill me ! 
 ok    _comma_    i can have it ready tomorrow afternoon    _comma_    but this suit is also very stained  .  i can ’ t guarantee we can remove it completely  .  
 fine ! can you also iron and starch this shirt ? 
 certainly  .  
 great ! this is our secret ! if you see my wife   _comma_   say nothing to her about this ! 
how often does the bus run ? 
 every five minutes  .  
 oh   _comma_   here comes a bus ! 
 it comes on the dot  .  
my warmest congratulations on your promotion ! 
 thanks  .  it ’ s nothing special actually  .  
 don ’ t say that  .  it owes to your efforts and team spirit  .  
 oh   _comma_   it was nothing  .  anyone could have done it  .  i still have a lot to learn yet  .  
 you are very modest  .  best luck in your new position  .  
 thank you  .  i won ’ t let this promotion change me  .  
yes   _comma_   emergency  .  there is a huge fire here  .  
 calm down   _comma_   sir  .  what s your name and where are you now ? 
 my name is jerry and we are on the intersection of west road and east road  .  
 sir   _comma_   leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house  .  our men will be over in   minutes  .  
do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? 
 of course ! it is the no  .    stressor in my life  .  you know job stress has become a very common problem these days  .  so we must learn to cope with it  .  
 totally agree  .  what is your solution ? 
 well      _comma_      there are two causes of job stress  .  one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition  .  so if we want to manage job stress      _comma_      both we and the companies should do something  .  for me      _comma_      i am trying to balance work and leisure time  .  you know      _comma_      all work and no play make jack a dull boy  .  
 you seem to have a very relaxed outlook  .  
 it is necessary  .  positive attitude helps to prevent stress  .  
 but i don ’ t think we can change our working condition  .  anyway   _comma_   we are not the bosses  .  
 i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them   _comma_   like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities  .  our boss is a smart person  .  he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team  .  
excuse me   _comma_   is this the parcel counter ?

 thank you  .  
 you are welcome  .

 you are right  .  but what if the avalanche happened ?

 anyway    _comma_    the show is breathtaking  .  by the way    _comma_    where did they get so much snow in here ? 
 don t you know that ? are you kidding me ?

 as you know    _comma_    we are in a very special time  .  this is a very hard time for many countries   economics    _comma_    both developed and developing  .  i think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies  .

 once the us economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack   _comma_   the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world  .

 outside   _comma_   on the sidewalk  .  
 hmm  .  it s very cold today . but i brought my jacket  .  maybe it will be alright to wait  .  
 the myoma is very popular  .  there will be a lot of people  .

 oh   _comma_   sorry . it stands for the museum of modern art  .  it s an acronym  .  m o m a myoma  .  
 i see  .  do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ? 
 i suggest you go to the jewish museum . it   s not far from the guggenheim    _comma_    near central park  .  it is really very interesting . also    _comma_    there is a great museum of medieval european art further up north . it   s called the cloisters  .

 check with somebody from the it department  .  they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment  .  
what should i do to prepare for a job interview ? 
 an understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential  .  do you have that ? 
 sort of    _comma_    but i could know more    _comma_    i guess  .  
 with that understanding   _comma_   you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude  .  right ? 
 i think that they are a very formal company  .  
 what you wear is important  .  so keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing  .  need help ? 
 i need a lot of help in this area  .  
 in addition to clothes we need to think about other basics   _comma_   ok ?

 be prompt  .  don t forget to be friendly and interested  .  listen carefully and listen to what they are really asking you  .  you ll be a hit ! 
what are your responsibilities as a secretary ?

 let me see here  .  yes   _comma_   there s one left  .  
 ok  .  i ll take that one then  .  
 alright  .  how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ? 
 i like to travel light so i just have this one  .  
 if that s your only piece of luggage   _comma_   it is small enough to carry on with you  .  would you like to do that so you don t have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? 
 yes   _comma_   please  .  that s a fantastic idea  .  which gate do i need to go to ?

i need a pan  .

 well    _comma_    the bigger the better    _comma_    i think  .  
 look at this one  .  it s our biggest pan  .  
 yes    _comma_    that is big enough    _comma_    but it s too heavy for me  .  
 okay   _comma_   we have the same thing in aluminum  .

 things are so great here  .  i almost smiled myself to death last week  .  one of my coworkers had to give me cpr  .  
 oh . jack   _comma_   i have missed your sense of humor . ha ha ha ! nobody else sees things quite like you do . it   s your gift  .  
 or a curse  .  
 nope    _comma_    it s a gift . anyway    _comma_    we need some more of those mid range speakers you tricked me into buying last time  .  
 that    _comma_    my dear    _comma_    was classic sales technique delivered by a professional  .  
 are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ? 
 heck no     _comma_     we doubled the price     _comma_     but because it s you     _comma_     i ll let you have em at    off  .  
 you silver tongued devil  .  can t you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ? 
 i could   _comma_   but where s the fun in that ? 
hi  .  i ’ m here for flight     returning to beijing but the board shows there is a delay . how long of a delay is expected ? 
 so far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late   _comma_   but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case  .  
 do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ? 
 i think you should stay in the airport  .  even though the delay is expected to be two hours   _comma_   the flight departure could be announced any minute  .  who knows ? 
 what seems to be the problem ? 
 it seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings  .  it happens all the time  .  no need to worry  .  
 umm  .  you know  .  actually i was thinking of trying another airline  .  no need to hold my seat  .  
i need to go to the atm  .  
 so   _comma_   why don ’ t you ? 
 i have no idea how to use the atm  .  
 what do you mean ? 
 this will be my first time using an atm  .  
 i can help you with that  .  
 explain to me how to use it  .  
 just put your card into the machine  .  
 now what do i do ? 
 then you need to type in your pin  .  
 now what ? 
 just click on one of the choices they give you   _comma_   and that ’ s it  .  
would you like something to drink ? 
 yes please  .  do you have any teas ? 
 of course we have lots of teas ? 
 what do you recommend ? 
 what about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ? 
 what ’ s this one ? 
 that ’ s oolong tea – it ’ s a cantonese tea  .  
 ok   _comma_   i ’ ll try that  .  
may   _comma_   is this the hall of ancient china ? 
 yes  .  look at these historical relics here   _comma_   amazing ! 
 why are they all in glass boxes ? 
 for protection  .  some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air  .  
 so there isn t air in the glass boxes ? 
 no   _comma_   there isn t  .  they are all vacuumed  .  
 i wonder how old these things are   _comma_   thousands of years ? 
 yeah   _comma_   they all come from a very ancient time  .  
 hey   _comma_   look at the three leg cup  .  i ve seen it on tv  .  
 the bronze cup was made    _comma_      years ago  .  it s priceless ! 
 yeah   _comma_   it has no value at all  .  who will use this cup today ? 
 danny   _comma_   priceless means so valuable that you can t put a price on it  .  
 oh   _comma_   it does ? 
i am so worried about this english contest  .  i have butterflies in my stomach now ! 
 i have confidence in you  .  believe in yourself  .  
what would you like on your pizzas ? 
 we want one vegetarian supreme and one double pepperoni  .  
 would you like anything to drink with that ? for     .      _comma_   you can get a two liter bottle of coke  .

comfort inn   _comma_   may i help you ? 
 i ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center  .  
 you ’ re in luck ! we ’ re just a two minute drive from there  .  would you like to make a reservation ? 
 not just yet  .  i have one or two questions  .  how much for a single ? 
 during the peak season   _comma_   a single room goes for    dollars on a night  .  but we ’ ve got a single super saver special going on right now – only      a night  .  and we ’ ve also extended our checkout time    in 
 that ’ s a good deal  .  since this is a working trip   _comma_   i wonder if you have meeting rooms where i can get together with some clients  .  
 yes       _comma_       we have five meeting rooms       _comma_       of various sizes  .  we can accommodate large meetings and small       _comma_       informal gatherings as well  .  of course       _comma_       if you have many small meeting       _comma_       you might consider checking 
 that sounds great  .  do you accept checks ? 
 i ’ m sorry    _comma_    sir    _comma_    we don ’ t  .  but we do accept all major credit cards  .  
i am sorry to trouble you   _comma_   but there s a lot of noise in the next room  .  
 oh   _comma_   is there ? which room is it ? 
 it s  .  i think   _comma_   neighbours on the right  .  
 you mean the room thirteen thirteen ? 
 i m not sure    _comma_    but i think so  .  i m very exhausted    _comma_    but i can t sleep  .  
 all right   _comma_   ma am  .  i ll check and tell them to be quiet  .  
 if next room is still noisy    _comma_    could you give me a different room    _comma_    please ? 
have you ever been to xi ’ an ? 
 yes   _comma_   i ’ ve been there several times on business trips  .  but i have never really seen the terra cotta warriors as it is outside the city  .  
 i ’ ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring  .  i really want to see the old walls and terra cotta warriors one day  .  of course i won ’ t miss the local food either  .  you know    _comma_    the sites interests a food in scenery    _comma_    food is a key factor when visiting a place  .  
 i agree  .  as long as the food is not too bizarre once i saw some people eating insects  .  that is frightening  .  
 sure it is  .  is it convenient to get there by plane ? 
 well    _comma_    the airport is quite far from the downtown area    _comma_    but it is still more convenient than taking the train  .  
a ticket to london   _comma_   please  .  
 a cheap day return ticket ? 
 yes   _comma_   including london tube  .  
 that ll be twelve pounds  .  
doctor   _comma_   what is the best way to stay healthy ? 
 having a good diet is probably the most important thing  .  
 it is very confusing to know what to eat  .  
 you need plenty of fruits and vegetables    _comma_    small amounts of protein    _comma_    and whole grains  .  
 are there certain things that i should avoid ? 
 you shouldn ’ t consume too much sugar or caffeine  .  also   _comma_   watch your intake of fatty food  .  
 after watching my diet   _comma_   what else should i do ? 
 you need to stop smoking   _comma_   and make sure that you get    minutes of exercise every day  .  
 can i have a glass of wine now and then ? 
 as long as you don ’ t overdo it   _comma_   a glass of wine a day should be ok  .  
darling   _comma_   i am back  .  what are you doing ? 
 i am washing clothes  .  are you hungry now ? wait for a moment   _comma_   i ll cook dinner for you  .  ( steven bends his brows ) 
 b   _comma_   should we get a maid ? 
 i can do all the housework  .  we don t need a maid  .  
 you have worked very hard in the office  .  if we can get someone to help you   _comma_   you can have more rest  .  
 we really don t need to  .  
 you are a good wife   _comma_   julia  .  but you must take care of yourself  .  
 give me some time to think about it  .  
can i reserve a room from the   th to the   th ? 
 certainly  .  how do you like your room ? 
 i d like a suite  .  what s the rate ? 
      per night  .  
is there anything i can do for you ? 
 excuse me   _comma_   can i change my order ? i am afraid i don t have so much time to enjoy my dinner  .  
 i am sorry   _comma_   sir  .  your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can t change it  .  
 that s all right  .  
have you graduated now ? 
 yes  .  i graduated this past june  .  
 which university did you graduate from ? 
 guangzhou university  .  
 what degree did you receive ? 
 i received a bachelor s degree in economics  .  
 what courses did you take in college ? 
 my major courses were microeconomics       _comma_       macroeconomics       _comma_       international trade       _comma_       international finance       _comma_       world economy       _comma_       psychology and business english 
 why did you choose to study economics ? 
 because i was quite interested in economics then  .  
 can you speak other languages except english ? 
 i can also speak a little japanese  .  
 i am very satisfied with your answers  .  
 thank you very much  .  
once you arrive at the american airport   _comma_   please call me  .  
 ok   _comma_   don ’ t worry about it  .  i will  .  
 take care of yourself  .  
sorry    _comma_    mary    _comma_    i can t make it in time for dinner  .  
 okay    _comma_    bob    _comma_    when will i see you ? 
 maybe i will be around later  .  
 okay   _comma_   i ll see you later  .  
i am sorry   _comma_   sir  .  i have broken the reading lamp in my room  .  
 well   _comma_   sir  .  may i have your room number ? 
      .  i would like to pay for it  .  
 please fill out the form first  .  
 ok   _comma_   can you bring me a new one ? 
 of course  .  
excuse me  .  i need to refill this prescription  .  
 it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills  .  
 yes   _comma_   i need to refill it today  .  
 alright  .  i m sorry    _comma_    miss  .  according to our file    _comma_    this prescription has already been refilled twice  .  
 i was worried about that  .  i couldn t remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not  .  
 well   _comma_   it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription  .  
 listen  .  this is an emergency  .  i tried to call my doctor   _comma_   but he is out of town  .  so i can t see him in time  .  i need this medicine  .  it is for skin condition  .  i ve run out . can you just refill it once more ? 
 i m sorry   _comma_   miss  .  we can t do it  .  we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out  .  
 but i need it  .  please  .  refill it for me just this once  .  i can go to the doctor around ten days from now  .  then i ll have another prescription  .  
 miss   _comma_   i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it   s the law  .  i can t do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription  .  never  .  
 but i have a prescription  .  i just need more of it  .  
 a prescription must be valid  .  it cannot be an expired prescription  .  i m sorry   _comma_   miss  .  it s the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you  .  
 oh    _comma_    it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan    _comma_    and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor  .  
 miss    _comma_    i just can t help you on this  .  i m a pharmacist    _comma_    not a doctor  .  and there are other customers i need to help now  .  i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it  .  i m sorry  .  
 this is ridiculous ! in taiwan   _comma_   it is much easier to get medicine when i need it  .  
 maybe that s true  .  i don t know . but i m sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too  .  
what are you doing ? 
 i ’ m trying to put the vase on the shelf  .  
 let regive you a hand  .  
 no    _comma_    thank you  .  i can manage it    _comma_    i think  .  
there are so many record players here  .  that is hard to choose  .  
 look at this one  .  it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers  .  
 i d rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound  .  
 yes   _comma_   but we shouldn t get any thing too big  .  remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture  .  
 that s right  .  now this one looks alright ? it s a detached or do you prefer this one ? it s sony  .  
 let s ask the salesmen for a demonstration  .  
ahhchooo ! 
 you ve been sneezing a lot lately  .  are you sick or something ? 
 no  .  every spring time around april   _comma_   i m stricken with allergies  .  
 i never have seasonal allergies  .  
 consider yourself lucky  .  
 what are all the symptoms ? 
 well       _comma_       as you just saw       _comma_       i sneeze a lot  .  also       _comma_       my nose becomes very runny       _comma_       my throat sometimes itches       _comma_       and my eyes start to water  .  
 that doesn t sound good  .  
 no   _comma_   it s not  .  so you don t have any type of allergies ? 
 well   _comma_   i have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol  .  it runs in the family  .  
 everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol  .  
 i get it pretty bad  .  my whole face turns red    _comma_    including my ears  .  my eyes become bloodshot    _comma_    and i start to itch all over my body  .  
 that s pretty bad  .  
 but that doesn t stop me from drinking  .  ahahah  .  
let s have a look at the map first  .  
 all right  .  wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here  .  
 let s buy some tickets  .  
 the train is coming  .  there are a lot of people waiting here  .  let s stand in a better position to get on the train 
 well    _comma_    it s not as crowded as we expected    _comma_    is it ? 
 no    _comma_    but it will be soon  .  look    _comma_    there re two empty seats over there  .  let s get them  .  
what do you do ? 
 i m an apprentice with a local engineering firm  .  my training lasts for two years  .  two days a week i study engineering at a local college  .  if i pass all my exams   _comma_   i hope the company will take me on as an engineer  .  
i want to keep a pet   _comma_   but i don t know which one to buy ? 
 dogs are nice    _comma_    but they are really energetic    _comma_    and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day  .  
 having a dog would probably be too much work for me   _comma_   then  .  
 what about cats ? they are more independent  .  
 actually   _comma_   i was thinking of something a little more exotic  .  i don t want a common pet like a dog or a cat  .  
 how about a lizard ? are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ? 
 yeah   _comma_   are they easy to look after ? 
 yeah   _comma_   they are pretty low maintenance ; they eat almost anything  .  
can i be of any service to you ? 
 i ve been told that chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship  .  we d like to take some home  .  what would you recommend ? 
 there are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop . for example       _comma_       there is tricolored pottery originating in the tang dynasty       _comma_       embroidery       _comma_       batik       _comma_       jade carving       _comma_       just to name a few . do you have anything in mind ? 
 no   _comma_   not really . but i think it should be something distinctively chinese  .  and easy to carry  .  
 i would suggest you buy paper cuts   _comma_   embroidery and batik . they are very easy to carry  .  
 so   _comma_   we d like to see some embroidery  .  
hey   _comma_   mary  .  we re back  .  have you eaten yet ? 
 i had some bread for breakfast  .  
 let s go out for brunch  .  
 brunch ? 
 it is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch  .  on sundays   _comma_   many americans sleep late and go out for brunch  .  those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also  .  
 actually    _comma_    many taiwanese wake up late on sunday mornings    _comma_    too  .  it may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch  .  
hi   _comma_   my name is sovia . what ’ s your name ? 
 my name is jeff  .  
 what do you do ? 
 i ’ m a podiatrist  .  what about you ? 
 i ’ m a nurse . what do you do in your free time ? 
 i like to play piano   _comma_   go bowling and chat with my friends . and you ? 
 i like to hang out with my friends   _comma_   play games and go swimming  .  
 would you like to go out some time ? 
 sure   _comma_   that ’ d be great . where would you like to go ? 
 anywhere with you  .  
 aren ’ t you sweet  .  
oh    _comma_    i m starving  .  i d like to try some real chinese cuisine  .  what would you recommend    _comma_    waiter ? 
 well      _comma_      it depends  .  you see      _comma_      there are eight famous chinese for instance      _comma_      the sichuan cuisine      _comma_      and the hunan cuisine  .  
 they are both spicy hot   _comma_   i ve heard  .  
 that s right  .  if you like hot dishes   _comma_   you could try some  .  
 they might be too hot for me  .  
 then there s the cantonese cuisine and the kiangsu cuisine  .  most southerners like them  .  
 what about any special beijing dishes ? 
 there s the beijing roast duck  .  
 oh   _comma_   yes  .  i ve heard a lot about it  .  i d like very much to try it  .  where can i find it ?

 yes   _comma_   that s why i m here  .  i m thinking about buying a second hand apartment  .

 that s true  .  by the way   _comma_   what kind of apartment are you looking for ? 
 my first job s salary will be a bit low  .  so the cheaper the better  .  just one i can afford  .

 i m sorry   _comma_   sir  .  you will need to wait at least a short time . we are very busy tonight  .  there was a big car accident on highway      .  
 i thought this was the emergency room  .  
 it is  .  but unless you are critically injured    _comma_    you still need to wait . you aren t bleeding    _comma_    are you ?

 yes  .  but why do i have to fill out a form anyway ? this is the emergency room  .  
 yes   _comma_   it is  .  but even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done . have you ever been in an emergency room before ?

 this cafe offers a wireless internet connection  .  that means i can get on the net for free while i ’ m here  .  of course   _comma_   i have to buy a cup of coffee ! 
 that ’ s great  .  can you do it anywhere ? 
 no  .  you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection  .  there are only about    or    places that offer it in this city  .  
 so   _comma_   what programs do you have on your laptop ? 
 i ’ ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs  .  
 i know you are keen on photography  .  it ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera  .  then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone    _comma_    anywhere    _comma_    at a 
 it ’ s wonderful   _comma_   isn ’ t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?

 i hope i could get promoted some day  .  tell me about your experience   _comma_   ok ? 
 well     _comma_     just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough     _comma_     you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective  .  don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging  .  they might be opportunities and failing is not fatal  .  you learn more from that actually  .  sometimes     _comma_     you need to fail to be successful  .

 i couldn t find the files you request   _comma_   even though i checked all the cross references  .  i don t think it s there  .  
 i am sure that document was filed  .  
 well   _comma_   let me check again under a different heading  .  
 good idea ! it seems that i asked you to put it in nova s files  .

 i am not sleepy  .  
 it s getting late   _comma_   and you have to wake up early tomorrow  .  
 there is no way that i can fall asleep right now  .

 it won t work  .  i m nowhere close to being tired  .  
 i really don t care   _comma_   just go to sleep  .  
 what if i stay up and do something   _comma_   until i get tired ? 
 you ll be up all night if i let you do that  .  
 i m going to get to sleep eventually  .  
 you need to go to sleep now   _comma_   so go to sleep  .  
 good night  .  
i want to go try on these clothes  .  
 what did you find ? 
 i found some jeans   _comma_   and a new blouse  .  
 go and try it on  .  
 what do you think ? 
 i love that shirt on you  .  
 what about the jeans ? 
 they don t really fit you right  .  
 i don t think so either  .  
 that blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though  .  
 well   _comma_   i ll just buy the shirt  .

now   _comma_   miss childs passed on your resume to me and i ’ ve had the chance to look it over and i must say i ’ m quite impressed  .  
 thank you very much  .  i ’ ve tried to keep it short and clear  .  if there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me  .  
 well yes    _comma_    i do have a number of questions    _comma_    but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background  .  
 yes      _comma_      of course  .  well as you can see from the resume i ’ m    and grew up in brooklyn      _comma_      new york      _comma_      although our family moved to london when i was quite young      _comma_      at around sixteen  .  
 ah i see   _comma_   so you were actually educated in europe ? 
 yes precisely  .  although i was born in the us   _comma_   i would definitely call london home  .  but as you see i ’ ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country  .  my father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in saudi arabia too  .  
 very interesting  .  so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood  .  
 absolutely ! we were never still for too long  .  but now i ’ m really looking to settle down  .  
 i see  .  okay   _comma_   well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ? 
can you tell me    _comma_    ms  .  smith    _comma_    about the training programs you initiated this year ? 
 we ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained  .  
 what ’ s the result ? 
 we directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of    % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received  .  
 that seems very impressive  .  good work ! 
 thank you   _comma_   but i cannot take all the credit  .  our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level  .  
well    _comma_    good morning    _comma_    tom  .  i haven t seen you for a long time  .  
 i d been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago  .  
 what seems to be the trouble now ? 
 i feel run down   _comma_   tired  .  i ve been having headaches almost every day  .  and i m not getting as much sleep as usually do  .  
 have you been eating properly ? eating the right kind of food is important for your health   _comma_   you know  .  
 well    _comma_    i haven t been eating well    _comma_    i guess  .  i usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch  .  
 and what about dinner ? 
 sometimes i m too tired to eat anything at all  .  
 that s not good  .  you don t have a well balanced diet  .  have you been taking vitamin pills ? 
 i don t like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first  .

 i want to get a puppy for my son  .  
 that will make him so happy  .  
 i ll get him one of those little dogs  .  
 one that won t grow up too big  .  
 and eat too much  .  
 do you know which one he would like ? 
 oh    _comma_    yes    _comma_    i took him there yesterday  .  he showed me one that he really liked  .

hello  .  i want to send the computer to my sister in shanghai by logistics transport  .  
 ok  .  is it in the box ? may i see it ? 
 yes  .  this is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor  .  
 is there anything else ? 
 there are a mouse and a camera  .  
 is that all ? 
 yes  .  how much is it to send these things to shanghai by regular delivery ?

 ok  .  see you later  .  
what happened ? why didn t he win ? 
 didn t you hear ? he was disqualified  .  
 how did that happen ? he s so talented ! i thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! 
 if he didn t have any drug problems   _comma_   he would have won  .  
 what ? what kind of drugs was he using ? 
 he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster  .  
 i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs  .  
 they are  .  the reason why they didn t disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards  .  
 that s so disappointing  .  i don t know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs  .  
 i don t think it s right   _comma_   but i can understand why they might  .  imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! 
 regardless of how much pressure you re under   _comma_   there s never a good reason to take drugs  .  
 i agree  .  hopefully with the new regulations   _comma_   fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs  .  
 let s hope so  .  
i need to use the atm  .  
 what ’ s stopping you ? 
 i ’ m not sure how  .  
 i don ’ t understand  .  
 i ’ ve never used one before  .  
 i can help you figure it out  .  
 what do i have to do ? 
 slide your card into the machine  .  
 then what ? 
 you need to type your pin in  .  
 what do i have to do next ? 
 click on whichever option you want   _comma_   and you ’ re done  .  
what are you doing ? checking the   to do   list for the wedding ? 
 yep  .  there s still so much to do ! 
 so let s start by checking off what we ve already done  .  
 did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the taiwanese guests ? 
 not yet   _comma_   i was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the net  .  
 cool ! i can t believe he agreed to go all the way to dallas with us ! 
 hey ! we re paying for his ticket ! 
it is my first time coming to china  .  i want to buy something unique of china to my friends as gifts  .  
 we have a great variety of chinese antiques and porcelain  .  do you like them ? 
 yes    _comma_    i love them    _comma_    but they are fragile  .  it is not convenient to take them  .  
 you are right  .  how about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ? 
 sounds good  .  may i have a look ? 
 of course  .  these paintings have many designs      _comma_      such as animals      _comma_      flowers      _comma_      landscape      _comma_      aquatics and so on  .  
 they are beautiful   _comma_   but i can t understand the connotation in them  .  let me see the handkerchiefs  .  
 all right  .  chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality  .  
 oh   _comma_   i like the bamboo design  .  what is this ? 
 this is a series of animals   _comma_   called chinese zodiac  .  
 good  .  so i will take three series and five bamboo ones  .  
 ok   _comma_   i will wrap them for you  .  
can you make out what he s saying ? 
 no   _comma_   it s too loud in here  .  
excuse me  .  
 yes ? 
 can you tell me the way to the peak tram   _comma_   please ? 
 certainly  .  go along queen s road  .  
 along queen s road  .  
 yes   _comma_   and turn right at the hilton hotel  .  
 right at the hilton  .  
 then go up garden road   _comma_   past the cathedral  .  
 the cathedral ? 
 yes  .  then cross the road at the next traffic lights  .  the peak tram is straight ahead  .  you can t miss it  .  
 that s very kind of you  .  thank you  .  er  .  have you got a pencil ? 
 yes  .  why ? 
 can you repeat all that ? i think i d better write it down  .  
hi    _comma_    nally    _comma_    are you hungry ? 
 i m starving  .  let s go grab a bite  .  
 where to ? 
 how about karlis ? 
 are you kidding ? that place is too ritzy for lunch  .  
 true  .  ok let s go to grumose ? 
 same thing   _comma_   meals there all coarsen arm and leg  .  
 i guess it is a little pricy  .  
 let s stop it at multicolor for a quick lunch  .  
 that will be ok  .  come on   _comma_   i can t wait to chow down  .  
 that was a great lunch    _comma_    the food was good    _comma_    but the service was lousy  .  
 is that why you stiffed the waiter ? 
 you got it  .  all right   _comma_   let s go back to school  .  
good morning   _comma_   sir  .  
 good morning  .  i d like a business suit made with this material  .  
 do you have a particular style in mind ? 
 the kind that never goes out of fashion   _comma_   i guess  .  
 i think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes  .  
 i m sure you re right  .  i just dread the idea of making a new suit every year  .  
 the changes are usually not that dramatic  .  we just got some pictures of the latest fashion  .  would you like to take a look ? 
 good  .  i think i ll choose this single breasted one  .  when can i get it ? 
 next friday  .  
 thank you  .  
oh   _comma_   gosh ! i feel everything around me is against me  .  
 don t take it too hard  .  there are some tips you should know in job hunting of       .  
 well   _comma_   i am all ears  .  maybe they are helpful  .  
 firstly      _comma_      you must always show your best to the interviewer  .  and secondly      _comma_      try to avoid spamming through e mails      _comma_      because this will make the reader go crazy  .  the last but not the least      _comma_      there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age  .  
 i understand what you mean   _comma_   and i will not upset myself  .  face it  .  
 good luck to us  .  
look   _comma_   mary ! there are so many people over there ! 
 oh    _comma_    i remember    _comma_    there is a job fair in the personnel market  .  
 i have never been to the personnel market  .  
 really ? i have been there several times  .  
 are there many employers ? 
 yes  .  the personnel market is a place specially for job hunters and employers  .  
 so there will be many large companies in the personnel market   _comma_   right ? 
 yes   _comma_   there are many famous corporations  .  
 when will there be a job fair ? 
 every saturday and sunday 
 do i need to pay to go into the personnel market ? 
 no   _comma_   it s free  .  
 how about going there to have a look now ? 
 ok   _comma_   let s go  .  
could you show me the t shirt on the model ? 
 here you are  .  we have three different colors    _comma_    white    _comma_    blue and pink  .  
 what s the price ? 
       .  
 can you make it any cheaper ? 
 it is cheap  .  
 i ll take it if you give me a discount  .  
       .  that s the best i can do  .  
 ok  .  i ll take the blue one  .  
hello   _comma_   again  .  did you discuss everything with your colleagues ? 
 yes   _comma_   yes  .  it seems that everything is settled  .  
 have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ? 
 we have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees s accounts   _comma_   whether they are currently with this bank or not  .  
 that s not a problem  .  
 of course    _comma_    if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank    _comma_    or open new accounts with you  .  
 thank you very much  .  we always welcome new customers  .  
i think this spring is a good time for us to start looking  .  
 we should plan to move out of here before july  .  i m tired of living in apartments  .  
 i know   _comma_   dear  .  i am too  .  but we ve just been too busy to look for a house  .  
 we need to find a good realtor  .  
 not necessarily  .  if we use a realtor to find a house   _comma_   it will be more expensive  .  
 what do you mean ? 
 realtors always get a commission . if the realtor helps us find something   _comma_   we have to pay him  .  
 but doesn t a realtor help with the contract ? i thought they take care of all the legal troubles  .  
 yes   _comma_   that s often true  .  but you have to pay them  .  
 i still think we should have a realtor . we   re new in this country  .  we don t know all the laws of buying a house . and also   _comma_   the realtor will inspect the house . he can tell us if the house has 
 of course we need a home inspector . but we can hire an inspector on our own . and as for the legal problems   _comma_   i have friends  .  they can help us  .  
 so how can we find a house if we don t have a realtor ? 
 it takes a little more time  .  we have to check the ads in the paper . probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . then we have to drive to the homes and look at them  .  
 and doesn t the person selling the house have a realtor ? 
 sometimes they do   _comma_   sometimes they don t  .  it s best to find someone who is selling by themselves  .  
 why ? 
 because if the seller has a realtor   _comma_   their price will be higher . he will have to pay a commission to the realtor  .  
 hmm  .  it all sounds very complicated  .  
 it is  .  but buying a house is very important  .  so it takes time . that   s why we haven t done it yet  .  it s very troublesome  .  
 i want to look in the papers today  .  maybe we can see something we like  .  
 alright  .  i ll buy a newspaper when i go to the drug store  .  
i m calling about our appointment  .  i can t call on you this evening . my wife is terribly ill  .  
 sorry to hear that  .  
 how about next week ? 
 fine   _comma_   we ll be expecting you then  .  
which restaurant do you prefer ? 
 i d like to taste mexican food  .  
 how about the one on baker street ? 
 oh   _comma_   i ve never seen a better mexican restaurant  .  
the numbers in this table don t seem to be in accord with reality  .  
 i know   _comma_   but these are the figures that we came up with  .  
oh   _comma_   so the zoo is over there  .  thank you so much for your help  .  
 you ’ re welcome  .  can i ask you what brings you to china ? 
 i ’ m actually travelling around asia  .  
 oh   _comma_   very nice  .  how long will you be in beijing ? 
 probably another week  .  
 oh     _comma_     i see  .  well     _comma_     i ’ ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide     _comma_     please call me  .  
 thank you very much  .  that ’ s very kind  .  
could you type up this document for me   _comma_   sandra ? 
 sure   _comma_   but i have to finish this report first  .  
 never mind  .  i ll do it  .  
are you interested in mountaineering ? 
 yes     _comma_     in some sense  .  i should say i like mountain climbing     _comma_     you know     _comma_     because i m not so professional  .  how about you 
 i m the same with you   _comma_   an amateur mountain climber  .  i went climbing in the rocky mountains with my friends last summer vacation  .  we spent two days in the mountains  .  
 how did you spend the night there ? 
 we pitched a tent in the night   _comma_   waiting for the sunrise  .  wow ! it was too beautiful  .  
 i had a similar experience   _comma_   but that was on the top of tasha mountain in my country  .  
 tasha mountain ? it s very famous in china   _comma_   isn t ? 
 yes  .  it is one of the five mountains  .  
 i want to climb tasha mountain this summer vacation  .  would you be my guide ? 
 i d love to  .  
sir   _comma_   what s wrong with you ? 
 i have a spasm of nausea and dizziness  .  
 have you ever suffered from airsickness before ? you re probably airsick  .  
 no   _comma_   this is the first time on a plane  .  maybe you are right  .  please get me some pills  .  
 ok  .  i will get some for you  .  there s an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you . please wait me for a moment  .  ( go away for a few minutes   _comma_   and now she comes back  .  ) here are two pills  .  and the water is in the glass too . please take the pills with water  .

 can you show me some traditional chinese arts and crafts ? 
 maybe sandalwood fan is good  .

 i ll take two small ones and a big one  .  
 what else are you interested in ? 
 i m afraid not  .  
 ok  .  here you are  .  
good morning . mrs . smith  .  
 good morning ! can you help me   _comma_   please ? i m looking for some books for my mother  .  
 well   _comma_   what kind of books does she like ? 
 she s very fond of detective stories ? 
 i see . has she read any detective stories ? 
 oh   _comma_   yes ! 
 do you know if she s read this one ? 
 i m not sure   _comma_   but she probably won t remember if she has ! she s very forgetful ! 
 ah ! she has a bad memory . how old is she ? 
 she s eighty seven  .  
 i suggest you take this book . it   s very exciting  .  
 thank you . that   s a good idea . she likes exciting books . can you suggest another one ? 
hey    _comma_    jimmy    _comma_    you ve been sitting in front of the tv all day  .  anything interesting on tv ? 
 not really  .  quite boring right now   _comma_   actually  .  mostly infomercials and public service announcements  .  
 why don t you turn off the tv and get outside ? you need to get some fresh air  .  
 i know    _comma_    i know . but my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes  .  it s the series finals    _comma_    and i wouldn t miss it for the world ! 
 really ? what s the series about ? 
 well   _comma_   it s about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in america  .  it s a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny  .  i think you d like it  .  
 it sounds interesting   _comma_   but i am not a big fan of tv shows  .  they re time consuming and don t have much depth  .  
 i believe some shows are quite informative and interesting  .  take this show for example    _comma_    it examines american xenophobia and how it might conflict with the american dream    _comma_    with hilarious results  .  
 really ? that s interesting ! 
 yeah . oh   _comma_   here it comes ! why don t we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode  .  it should be good  .  
 ok   _comma_   i ll give it a go  .  
hello   _comma_   hot water overflowed from the bathtub  .  would you help me ? 
 would you turn off the tap ? 
 i did it  .

 ok   _comma_   i will  .  
 i will have our housekeeper come right away  .  
 i am sorry   _comma_   i was too tired to fall asleep  .  
 when you woke up   _comma_   the water was coming out the tub ?

 well   _comma_   little girls seem to love barbie dolls  .  
 that s perfect  .  i want to see one  .  
 here you are — she s called digital barbie  .  
 oh   _comma_   i like digital barbie ! how much does she cost ? 
 this barbie is only      .     .  
 that s perfect  .  let me have her  .  
 very good  .  is there anything else you would like ? 
 no   _comma_   that ll do it for now  .

 yes   _comma_   sir  .  please examine it  .  
 anything subject to duty in your suitcase ? 
 no     _comma_     sir  .  nothing except my personal belongings     _comma_     such as clothes     _comma_     notebooks and some gifts  .  
 any cigarettes or liquor ? 
 i have cigarettes for my own use  .  
 i think you ll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota  .  and this article is liable for duty  .  
 how much duty should i pay ? 
 one hundred dollars  .  
 here is the money  .  
 just a moment  .  i ll make out your duty memo  .  ( writing and giving the memo to mr  .  green ) take it and pay the girl over there  .  
 thank you  .  
so that concludes the introduction  .  now let s move to the first part of my talk      _comma_      which is about      fiscal year marketing plan  .  so first      _comma_      right off the bat      _comma_      when looking at the marketing plan      _comma_      tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with  .  
 we wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also    _comma_    in line with that goal    _comma_    redo our image  .  
 that s correct  .  if you remember               _comma_               we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets  .  now               _comma_               when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals               _comma_               there are three things to consider  .  first               _comma_               the original condition of the market               _comma_               second               _comma_               our marketing numbers from the previous year               _comma_               and third               _comma_               our final sales figures for this year  .  now i want to describe for you the second and third parts  .  if you look at the overhead               _comma_               you ll see a graph  .  the blue line represents our sales from the year                    _comma_               the red line is the sales in       .  as you can see               _comma_               our sales in      were quite slow to start off with               _comma_               but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year  .  on the other hand               _comma_               you can see this year s sales took off like a rocket  .  
excuse me    _comma_    sir    _comma_    may i talk to you ? 
 bill ! sure   _comma_   come on in  .  what can i do for you ? 
 well sir    _comma_    as you know    _comma_    i have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years  .  
 yes  .  
 i won ’ t beat around the bush  .  sir   _comma_   i would like a raise  .  i currently have three companies after me and so i decided to talk to you first  .  
 a raise ? son    _comma_    i would love to give you a raise    _comma_    but this is just not the right time  .  
 i understand your position     _comma_     and i know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales     _comma_     but you must also take into consideration my hard work     _comma_     pro activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade  .  
 taking into account these factors    _comma_    and considering i don ’ t want to start a brain drain    _comma_    i ’ m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time  .  how does that sound ? 
 great ! it ’ s a deal ! thank you   _comma_   sir ! 
 before you go    _comma_    just out of curiosity    _comma_    what companies were after you ? 
 oh    _comma_    the electric company    _comma_    gas company and water company ! 
are you going to vote on tuesday ? 
 of course  .  how about you ? 
 i ’ ve already voted  .  
 how ’ s that ? 
 i sent in an absentee ballot  .  
 why ? 
 i won ’ t be able to vote on tuesday  .  
 why not ? 
 i have to work  .  
 why don ’ t you go to work late ? 
 i have important business to take care of that morning  .  
 i see  .  
how would you describe your ideal job ? 
 i think the job should make use of the professional experience i have obtained   _comma_   and offer me opportunity for advancement  .  
 why do you think you might like to work for our company ? 
 i feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and i am very interested . what   s more   _comma_   your company is outstanding in this field  .  
 what makes you think you would be a success in this position ? 
 my graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job  .  i am sure i will be successful  .  
 how do you know about this company ? 
 your company is very reputed in this city  .  i heard much praise to your company  .  
did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning ? 
 no  .  i haven t had a chance to read the paper yet  .  
 you ve got to see it  .  it s an unbelievable picture ! 
 what s so interesting about it ? 
 well    _comma_    this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up    _comma_    half his face had been bitten off ! 
 what ? how did that happen ? 
 they think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn t   _comma_   so ended up biting him in his face  .  
 wow  .  what does his look like now ? 
 it looks pretty frightening  .  he doesn t have any lips   _comma_   so all you can see are his gums and teeth  .  most of his nose and chin are missing too  .  
 what did he look like before his dog bit his face off ? 
 he was actually quite handsome  .  what a shame  .

 your products may have certain advantages   _comma_   but your prices are too stiff  .

hey there chris   _comma_   what are you up to ? 
 i m just poring over some brochures about various car models  .  
 oh   _comma_   so you re thinking about buying a new car ? 
 yeah     _comma_     it looks that way  .  my wife has been bugging me about it  .  i thought we could probably survive without one     _comma_     but with a baby on the way     _comma_     maybe it is time to get a car  .  
 so this would be your first automobile ? 
 that s right  .  for quite a few years   _comma_   i rode a bicycle to work  .  then i got a motorbike  .  
 yeah   _comma_   i think i can understand your wife s position  .  asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she s pregnant is a tall order  .  
 oh  .  i don t let her ride with me  .  it s just too dangerous  .  she takes the bus to work   _comma_   but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it s crowded and hot  .  
 so it s time to buy your very first car ! wow   _comma_   that s exciting ! 
 yes   _comma_   but it s also a pretty big financial responsibility  .  
 yeah  .  i still remember my first car  .  it was an old clunker that my dad gave me when i turned     .  i drove it around for a couple of years until i scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car  .  
 i m having a hard time deciding which model is best for us  .  
 yeah   _comma_   it is a tough call  .  each one has its pros and cons  .  are you looking for a sedan ? 
 yes    _comma_    i d like a jeep    _comma_    but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives  .  
 i d advise you to listen to your wife  .  she will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice  .  
can i help you ? 
 i d like to send a fax to shenzhen  .  
 is it a photograph or a document ? 
 each of both  .  
 could i see both of them ? 
 here you are  .  
 you can t send this document ; it is not clear enough to send  .  the photograph is all right  .  
 well   _comma_   how long will it take to arrive in shenzhen ? 
 couple of minutes  .  
 great  .  how much ? 
      .  you should change another much clearer photograph for fax  .  
 thank you  .  i will deal with it  .  
good morning    _comma_    can i see your passport    _comma_    please ?

 no   _comma_   you mustn t sit on the grass  .  don t you see the notes ? 
 yes   _comma_   i can see it  .  but what s on it ? 
 it says   keep off the grass !   
 well   _comma_   there s a bench under the tree  .  we can sit there  .  
 be careful  .  you can t smoke here  .  
 why not ? 
 can t you see the notes there ? it says   no smoking here    .  
i d like a double room  .

 probably two days  .  my wife will join me tomorrow  .  then we will decide when to leave for seattle  .  
 would you sign the register   _comma_   pls ? 
 by the way   _comma_   does my room have a private bath ? 
 certainly   _comma_   every room in this hotel has a private bath  .  
 does my room have twin beds or a double ? i prefer a room with twin beds  .  
 your room has twin beds   _comma_   mr . lee  .  it also has a view  .  i am sure you will like it  .  this is your key  .  it s on the eighth floor room      .  the elevator s over there  .  
 thank you  .  one more thing   _comma_   where is your restaurant ? 
 the restaurant is on the second floor  .  we also have a cafeteria on the top floor  .  if you would like something to drink   _comma_   you can either call room service or come down here  .  the bar is right behind the lobby  .  
 thank you   _comma_   you are very kind !

good morning    _comma_    may  .  good girl    _comma_    you are reading english books again  .  
 good morning  .  there is no reason to miss so beautiful a morning  .  is that a new bird ? 
 oh    _comma_    yes    _comma_    my daughter bought it yesterday  .  we call her lulu  .  
 it looks so cute  .  is it a parrot ? 
 yes  .  just look at her colorful feathers  .  what else can it be ? 
 i see  .  it s interesting that there is also a parrot in my english book  .  his mane is polly  .  
 really ? a foreign parrot ! 
 he can speak english   _comma_   too  .  
 maybe you can teach lulu some english words  .  
 lulu  .  lulu  .  say hello  .  hello  .  oh   _comma_   she is so smart  .  good bird  .  
my mp  player is broken   _comma_   so i want to change it for an mp  player  .  can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? 
 an mp  player ? why don t you buy a new cell phone ? you can find an mp  player inside any of the latest cell phones  .  
 oh   _comma_   that s a good idea  .  perhaps i should have a try  .  
 look at my cell phone  .  i can listen to music      _comma_      watch movies      _comma_      take pictures      _comma_      play games      _comma_      surf the web and download documents  .  it s just like a pad  .  
 that s cool  .  i can use the computer and the internet pretty well   _comma_   but i m a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products  .  
 that s ok  .  you know    _comma_    digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry    _comma_    and they won t cost you too much  .  
 yeah     _comma_     if i buy a cell phone like this     _comma_     i don t have to take a music player everywhere i go     _comma_     and i can save the cost of buying an extra mp   .  
 that s right  .  what s the flash memory of your old mp  ? 
    mb  .  
 then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over    mb  .  
what can i get you ? 
 a cheeseburger and an order of french fries would be great  .  
 would you like anything to drink ? 
 i feel like having a coke  .  
 that s a good idea  .  i think i ll join you  .  
mr  .  bryant ? hi   _comma_   i m mike from florence incorporated  .  i ll glad you made it okay  .  how was your flight ? 
 it was pretty bumpy    _comma_    also a bit long    _comma_    all together about   hours  .  
 that is a long flight  .  you had a layover too   _comma_   is that right ? you must be tired  .  
 actually i feel quite rested  .  i was able to sleep on the plane  .  
 good ! here   _comma_   let me help you with your bag  .  is it your first time to seattle ? i d be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you re up to it  .  
 that will be very nice  .  you re too kind  .
