yeah  _comma_  i m doing alright now  _comma_   but with minor injuries . 
cool :) is your car damaged a lot?
the car was badly damaged _comma_ i veered outside the road and hit a tree trunk .  next thing is insurance follow up . 
a few weeks ago    _comma_     i was walking through my hallway    _comma_     minding my own business    _comma_     when all of a sudden a hand reached out from under a table and grabbed my ankle .  i was so suprised .  i thought i was got .  turns out    _comma_     it was my son .  
that s funny _comma_  hope he didn t give you a heart attack . 
i may have let out a scream that will have him question my manhood for the rest of our lives _comma_  lol .  
i would probably scream also . 
i m overly excited because will be flying outside the country for the first time tomorrow .   .   please enter here . 
wow! that sounds amazing .  where are you going? 
traveling to south africa then to ghana .  also my first time visiting africa
you are going to love it i am sure .  safe travels! 
one time   _comma_    i was holding my son over my head   _comma_    when all of a sudden   _comma_    he threw up all over my face .  i almost cried . 
thats horrible _comma_  hope he is ok . 
yeah  _comma_   he had just drank a bottle  _comma_   and i was moving him around like an airplane .  in retrospect .  i deserved it . 
i see _comma_  glad he is ok . 
hello
hi _comma_  how are you?
im doing great i just wanted to tell you a short story about a time i helped an elderly lady .   she was struggling to carry her bags from a trip she had took .   i helped her carry them to her door ! pretty good feeling when you help others 
that was kind of you _comma_  i am sure they appreciated that!
i went to the kemah boardwalk with my boyfriend .  it made me think of times i went vacationing with my family . 
my last vacation went horribly wrongq!
all i thought about was being at home again and being able to relive those moments . 
yes i love to reminice
my dog died a few years ago after i had my son .   it was right around christmas and i had the dog for fourteen years . 
im sorry to hear that .  i have never had a dog .  what was your experience of the dog?
the dog was there with my throughout my life .  he saw me through boyfriends and friends . 
i am really sorry to hear that .  what was the dogs name?
hello
hello how are you and what is your story chat about today? 
i locked my keys in my car about a week ago .  it was    degrees outside and i was at the store getting groceries . 
omg wow .  i hope you got it open quick! 
luckily there are police who patrol around the mall on the other end of the parking lot .  one of them got it open for me
hello
hi       _comma_        a few months ago       _comma_        my mother found some stray dogs that were starving       _comma_        so she told us about them .  of course       _comma_        we brought the poor babies to our house       _comma_        a mother dog and her two puppies .  my heart went out to them       _comma_        as their ribs were showing       _comma_        but they were still so loving and sweet . 
oh no im so sorry to hear that :  thats good that you took them in 
yes    _comma_     i really felt so much sympathy for them and we all really liked them .  we already had several pets    _comma_     so i wasn t going to keep them    _comma_     but i wanted to help them get better and find them a good home .  we did for all of them    _comma_     with the puppies being able to stay together . 
i wanted to let you know recently i saw a younger man helping an old lady who fell to the ground .  its nice to see people helping others
that is really nice to see .  i bet it made you feel good! so sweet .  
yeah it made me feel great :)
nice to still see that behavior in todays world .  :)
so this one time my grandmother gave me a scooter  _comma_   it was the best gift ever  _comma_   i was really happy
thats sweet that you remember that _comma_  how old were you? 
i was around    years old i think _comma_  it was quite a long time ago for me now haha!
i wont make you reveal your age! lol :p 
hah appreciated _comma_  have you ever received a fun gift?
i was extremely lucky when my girlfriend said she would date me _comma_  she is my world now . 
that s wonderful .  how long have you guys been dating?
we have been together for close to   months now _comma_  so not very long haha!
time flies by pretty fast .  could be together    years from now!
i hope so haha _comma_  are you dating anyone?
i started a new job about a month ago and it s going really well . 
congratualtions .  what do you do?
i work in i . t .  for the provincial government in canada :)
oh wow .  we re practically neighbors . 
so my friend built a deck and it turned out amazing _comma_  i didn t know he had it in him . 
how big was the deck?
i think its probably about    feet by    feet? i m bad at guessing that kind of stuff hah
wow that is big . 
my girlfriends really quiet and she tends to scare me a lot . 
what is scary about what she is doing? i m not quite understanding what you mean . 
well  _comma_   when shes dealing with her own personal issues she tends to kind of just vanish  _comma_   i haven t talked to her in a few days and it s making me worry . 
oh wow _comma_  i can see why you re worrying .  you should really talk to her about all this if she comes around soon . 
i have to fill out forms all day so i scripted a program that does half of it for me and it works really well!
thats great .  did you create the script?
yeah _comma_  had to google a bit of it but it worked out well . 
i love google .  it is my favorite search engine . 
i was extremely relieved when i found out my dad beat cancer . 
thats wonderful news! its such a nasty disease! how long has he been clear? 
about   years now . 
well i hope he has     more years to go! :) 
my girlfriend hasn t talked to me in a few days and i m struggling to keep it together but i am at the moment . 
have you tried to call her?
i have _comma_  but she s going through a rough time and likes to seclude herself . 
maybe give her space . 
my grandma gave me a stone and said it was my birthstone and i hold it very close to my heart now . 
what birthstone is it . 
it is amethyst . 
what birthstone is it?
i play some competitive video games and i think i m pretty good at one of them . 
i love to play madden . 
do you play madden often?
yes _comma_  every day . 
i haven t been able to talk to my girlfriend in a few days and it s making me quite sad . 
where is she?
she s in the same city as me _comma_  but she s going through a hard time and has decided to seclude herself so i can t reach her . 
just give her space . 
my daughter is very smart .  she learns things really quickly . 
thats great . 
yes _comma_  she picks up on things that i didn t even think she knew about . 
did you teach her?
i can t believe how big the waves are .  hurricane chris amped up my summer . 
did you stay and ride it out? i bet it was quite a thing to see!
yes _comma_  i ve been surfing for ever .  only three of us in the water .  
that must be so much fun .  i have never surfed but love to be on a boat .  
you are never to old to start .  i m teaching my mate and he is    i think .  hopefully i have a boat soon .  
wow i hope i am fit enough at    to surf!
i usually hate to ask for help _comma_  so when my friends all surprised me by taking turns bringing us meals for   weeks after my  th child was born i was blown away .  i was so relieved to have help .  
wow _comma_    children my first is on the way and i m freaking out .  you must have great friends .   
that is so exciting  _comma_   congratulations! we moved    hours away from family  _comma_   so having a great group of friends is really important to us .  
thank you .  that is our next step we are moving from nyc to miami after the baby .  how can we find friends like yours? 
get involved in something .  church  _comma_   a social club for interests you are in .  i don t recommend parent groups  _comma_   for some reason they get really nasty .  just find a way to connect with people .  having children is so much harder without a support system!
i see what you mean about a parents group .  i joined a dads group in facebook and it s full of people who complain non stop about  being an adult .  
i went to this thing called a paint night and i ended up making an okay looking painting
that sounds fun _comma_  i was never any good at painting
i am not either _comma_  but they had an instructor to follow along to! :)
that probably helps a good deal!
that jerk _comma_  did nt even wave when he cut me off .  
i wish i had a rubber bumper to ram those people with!
after the apocalypse i ll just ran them off the road .  to make things worse he was in a horse and buggy .  
that is terrible _comma_  he could have hurt the horse!
that s what me the most mad .  it s like he did not care at all .  
so i got a new job recently _comma_  and i got my first paycheck and it was pretty good compared to what i was expecting!
nice _comma_  congratulations .  how are you liking the new job itself?
it s pretty good so far _comma_  i think i m gonna like it for the long haul!
awesome _comma_  i hope the job goes great for you!
when i was a little girl _comma_  our cat ran away and was gone so long we didn t think he would come home so we adopted another kitten .  
thats sad _comma_  hopefully the new cat got to live a long and full life with you
well  _comma_   we had a funny twist .  the same day we brought the new kitten home  _comma_   or old cat showed up .  we kind of thought maybe he was hanging out close to home and was mad that we replaced him . 
haha thats crazy  _comma_   i hope they became best friends  _comma_   i love cats . 
i really liked having my mom here .  she helped with the kids but then when she left i missed it . 
i can imagine! that extra set of hands    and a person you can  trust     that s the best!
yes _comma_  the kids really missed her when she left .  it took us a while to get back to the normal around here . 
does she live far away? it sounds like maybe visits aren t too frequent . 
this one time i spent an entire hour waiting for food at dennys . 
an hour? damn for somewhere as meh as denny s that really isn t worth it . 
its really not _comma_  the foods not worth that long of a wait . 
i haven t been there in so long for that exact reason . 
i went to a nice work dinner with my husband .  i can t get over how stupid i made myself look .  
oh really? what happened that made you look bad?
i went to the bathroom real fast before we went into the dining room .  i tucked my dress into my panty hose and didn t even notice .  i walked past everyone with my underwear showing .  i m sure i ll laugh about it .  someday .  
oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or    before you can laugh at it but at least its over . 
a lady was having issues with a program on her computer _comma_  and i solved it with no problems!
that s awesome! my experience was quite opposite as i sat waiting in the dentist chair for a       hour procedure!
that sounds unpleasant _comma_  did you get in afterwards?
yes! i m actually glad it s over :) so _comma_  how long did it take you to fix the computer problem?
i m so angry they end up charging me     in charges that did not belong to me .   
yeah _comma_  that is pretty annoying to have happen . 
i called them and did not hold back .  
good man! that is your money and they just wanna snatch from you . 
i was going to go down and go nuts but my wife stopped me .  
my friend was telling me about teaching jobs to apply for .  i didn t get hired _comma_  but she got one right off the bat!
it sounds like you re happy for her _comma_  which is commendable given you didn t get hired .  were you very disappointed?
i was kind of envious that she got the job and i didn t because it seemed like i was more qualified than she was . 
that s always tough .  it s so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that .  are you happy where you re currently at _comma_  or still looking?
my girlfriend has some mental health issues and sometimes ends up in the hospital _comma_  and i go and see her as often as i can . 
i m so sorry about that .  it sounds like you re doing your best to be supportive . 
thanks  _comma_   i am definitely trying to be as supportive as i can  _comma_   she s my world . 
she s very lucky to have you .  i wish you guys the best!
i love going to places that i explored and play at as a child .  every time i go _comma_  i always feel super nostalgic . 
i am very nostalgic too _comma_  that must be a fun time!
yes  _comma_   until you realize that it was    years since you played there  _comma_   and you start feeling old
that is true   _comma_    but it is part of life   _comma_    but it is cool to see things again   _comma_    regain perspective
i hope this doesn t make me sound like a horrible boyfriend   _comma_    but when my girlfriend first moved into my house   _comma_    i felt very apprehensive towards the move at first .  i was used to it being one way   _comma_    and she was changing everything .  took some getting used to . 
i m sure it did! it s not easy to have to adapt to another person s habits . 
i know .  it caused some tension the first week or so .  i had to take a deep breath  _comma_   and realize its just things  _comma_   and it was just me being reluctant to change .  
yes _comma_  sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things .  it sounds like you have done a great job!
i always hate thinking that my son is getting old .  just like a few days ago  _comma_   i was looking at some of my sons old clothes  _comma_   and it made me very sentimental .  i never want him to get old on me .  
i believe you are really sad although it s a fact of life
yes .  you get to see them change and grow .  it makes it all worth it .  
true  _comma_   and the good thing is that when the kids grow  _comma_   they provide moral support to parents . 
i love a good surprise like anyone else; however  _comma_   when my girlfriend waited until   pm on my birthday to tell me happy birthday and give me a present  _comma_   i was caught off guard .  i thought she had forgot .  
maybe she did and remembered last minute .  you should ask her!
she remembered but was trying to draw it out to make me think that she had forgot .  i should have known because i made her wait until    pm on her birthday . 
next year i would just forget her birthday all together!
i work two full time jobs and he stays at home all day _comma_  not fair!
is he a stay at home father _comma_  or does he just not want to work?
he s    he just wants to party and sleep . 
i am sorry to hear that .  maybe as he gets older he will get his priorities in order and see how hard you work . 
doubtful _comma_  he s a punk!
so the other day was my   rd birthday! i had no idea what my friends had planned but i walked into a room   _comma_    a room which i thought was empty as the lights were all off   _comma_    and all my friends jumped out and yelled happy birthday! it was such a shock   _comma_    and felt so nice to have people who cared deeply about me provide me with such an experience! 
must of been pretty surprised _comma_  also great to have friends like that . 
it really was! they even had my favorite kind of cake _comma_  chocolate mousse from my favorite bakery! 
that must of just made everything even better!
right?! i mean who doesn t love cake .  but that s not even the best part .  on the counter _comma_  there was a huge pile of presents calling my name .  
i m thrilled .  i got a raise!
that is a great news .  you surely have done a great job . 
best ever .  i didn t have a clue i was going to get it .  i just walked in and boom got a raise . 
you are very lucky
your not kidding and to think i was going to quit .  
have you seen the film  within  on netflix? the other night my boyfriend and i watched it and i had trouble sleeping afterwards _comma_  it was pretty creepy!
no i haven t actually _comma_  i recently just canceled my netflix service! i have been thinking about resubscribing though .  
why did you cancel your subscription? if you ever re subscribe i would definetly recommend checking out  within !
i could not find the content that was best suited for me personally to consider it worthy at the time _comma_  but if i do i will definitely check it out!
i spilt wed wine on my moms red carpet and blamed it on the cat
was the color of red that different to show on the red carpet?
very! it was a dark maroon stain .  
oh! wow that must of been pretty obvious then . 
my wife is angry and i don t know what to say .  my anniversary was yesterday and i had no clue!
argh! that s tough! have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology? it can be easy to be defensive in those situations _comma_  which of course only makes it worse!
i m still working on it .  she has has not given me much of a chance .  
what s your approach? does humor ever work . ? you know  _comma_   like wearing a dunce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers? or going john cusack and holding a boombox overhead  _comma_   playing  your  song?
i used diamond earrings .  
so the other night my boyfriend and i were out socializing at a networking event and another woman went up to him and touched his arm i coudn t help but feel a little envious even though he pulled away . 
you should not be so insecure like that . 
its not about insecurity! 
what is about them? do you think he is better than you?
have you ever been to las vegas? 
yes _comma_  several times . the place is magical . 
i m actually going for the first time in my adult life this fall! i m really excited!
well  _comma_   you are about to have the fun of your life  _comma_   but gamble responsible . 
i was thinking about my boyfriends wedding proposal the other night _comma_  it had left me in absolute shock .  i did not expect him to get down on one knee and propose . 
why .  did you started dating recently or something
no we d been dating a very long time but he was never the traditional kind .  never wanted an official ceremony but after meeting me i guess it all changed!
the most important thing is what you want . 
i m one of the best surfers that has ever hit the beach .  i ride giants . 
really?? are you famous then? what is your name?
yes _comma_  you can google me . 
are you still competing on a professional level?
nope _comma_  i ve got a family now to support so i surf less and work more .  but i ve still got killer moves .  
i can t believe the bottom of the bag ripped and my wonderful taco s covered the ground .  i m sure my face was bright red with anger . 
not the tacos!!!! seriously _comma_  i can understand how frustrating that is .  especially when you have the taste for something . then gone!
it s not like i could back in .  i waited in line    minutes and had been looking forward to them all day .  i had to skip lunch due to work being busy .  i m still mad . 
even worse .  i m so sorry .  what did you do instead?
a bowl of dry cereal .  
laughing  and  crying for you! next time!
text time i m going to treat those sweet fatty taco s like the baby of jesus .  i get heated up just thinking of it . 
i wish i could emoticon this whole thing . a string of cry laughing .  i wish i could treat you to lunch there!
have you ever participated in any races _comma_  half or full marathons? 
i have not! i used to run a lot for soccer practices .  have you?
i have not either! my best friend recently recovered from a broken leg and just completed her first full marathon _comma_  it was inspirational!
that s great for her .  
i am not afraid to admit this: i am    and afraid of the dark .  the other day     _comma_      my electricity went out due to a storm .  it was dark     _comma_      i couldn t find my phone or a light     _comma_      so i screamed for my girlfriend to wake up .  am i embarrassed to say that     _comma_      not at all     _comma_      lol
hahaha thats funny why are you still afraid of the dark?
i am not scared of the dark .  i am just scared of the things in the dark .  and the ironic thing is   _comma_    i don t even believe in the supernatural   _comma_    so i am scared of the dark to just be scared of it   _comma_    i think .  
ooo so you think something else is hiding in the dark and that s why your scared?
nope .  i am just scared that in case there is the supernatural .  it makes sense in my head;however   _comma_    when i am saying it out loud   _comma_    it doesnt   _comma_    lol
before i applied at inline i really did some background research on the company and what all they were involved in . 
that s probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place .  were you happy with your results?
i was!  it ended up securing me the job because the company itself is small so the ceo and interviewer were really impressed . 
sometimes it s the extra step someone is willing to do that will make it .  good for you!
thank you!  i really enjoy this position a lot so i am happy it turned out well . 
my husband hangs steel and the last time he had to go work in another state i felt really lost and alone for a bit . 
i feel the same way when i m away from my cat .   does he have to travel a lot for work?
sometimes he does .   lately there hasn t been any local work so he has had to go out of state and its just too far to come back . 
maybe one day if you have the time _comma_  you can pay him a surprise visit . 
that is a good idea! i ll have to sneak his work schedule and give it a try . 
i made it on time to the bus stop . 
that is good .  where you running late
i was running late and so did the bus . 
that sucks .  i hate when i am running late i always feel behind
so i kind of ate the last piece of pizza that we had and i didn t know tom wanted it .  feeling kinda bad . 
i don t think you should feel bad _comma_  you didn t know!
yeah but he just seemed so disappointed when he came home for lunch . 
i m sure he will be okay .  maybe you can make it up to him . 
i should probably just buy him another pizza soon . 
sounds like a good idea . 
i will start off saying i hate the water! i can t stand being in it; however _comma_  that changed last week when i took my son to his first pool .  his joy erased all my hatred for water .  
aw .  children will make us do things we never thought we would (or could) do! 
yes! i start swimming lessons next week .  i have went    years without knowing how to swim _comma_  and that one visit changed all that .  
that is so exciting! congratulations! you are a fabulous role model for your son . 
oh today i heard one of nannie s favorite songs on the radio .   it made me really miss our car rides together .   
oh that s so sweet .  my grandmother is a great person too and i m glad to know her . 
she was a lovely lady indeed!  i miss our time together a lot especially when i hear the music she used to listen to . 
i think it s great that you have such positive memories of her _comma_  that way she ll always be there in some form . 
do you go visit some place that makes you miss growing up?
yes _comma_  i love to visit the zoo!  
i recently went back to michigan and got visit my old town and even the high school i had such great times back then . 
what were some of your favorite things to do back in highschool?
i played football all   years _comma_  used to skateboard in the parking lot and hang out in the auto shop .  the good old days . 
my mother was always there for me when i was sick _comma_  annoyed and sad
that is wonderful! .  it is always nice to have at least one good parent . 
well my dad too but my mum was so much more _comma_  even when i was naughty she was still there . 
my mom was pretty awesome too! i m glad you had a good one as well . 
when i was little i got chased by a large dog and now that i m much older the feeling is still the same .  
that is bad .  are you still afraid a lot?
i am  _comma_   everytime i see a dog  _comma_   i begin to run the other direction instantly
you need to fight your fear
i actually have no friends _comma_  can you believe that? i m ok with it though . 
wow that s very sad!  i am really sorry!
no  _comma_   it s not sad .  i really like to be alone  _comma_   as i m an introvert .  i need my space . 
well i guess if that is something you enjoy .   i can t say that i have alot of friends .   mostly my friends are family 
well in that case  _comma_   i have a few friends .  outside of family  _comma_   i don t .  
do you ever find it hard to see at night when it s raining?
yes i do actually _comma_  i was almost in an accident because of rain at night once .  
that s so scary! i am always on edge in those cases .  i hydroplaned really bad last time . 
i m glad you were okay and nothing bad happened .  
thank you .  i ve never been in a traffic accident .  thank goodness for that . 
i was eating at a restaurant and as i was leaving _comma_  an employee there gave me my phone which i had left behind
oh that was so nice of them! i bet you were relieved!
i was _comma_  it saved me a lot of problems
i bet _comma_  losing your phone causes all kinds of stress!
i written down my notes on a double sided a  paper _comma_  now i just have to wait for the exam which will begin in the next   minutes . 
okay that s good to know .  hopefully you pass the test and i hope you studied .  
oh i did _comma_  i have been doing it for weeks!
very nice man .  let me know your exam results when they re released! 
an employee who had not been working as long as me received a promotion
oh no! i ll bet that made you feel terrible!
i definitely did not feel appreciated
i can see why not! i m so sorry that happened to you . 
when that happened to me _comma_  even the teacher couldn t stop herself from laughing .  
that is hilarious .  i bet . 
i was so awkward and quiet in school _comma_  how about yourself?
oh my just the opposite lol
so you were outgoing and popular _comma_  huh?
i can t wait to december when my first born arrives into the world .  i m going to make sure they have a great life . 
oh wow! congratulations! that is wonderful . 
thanks i m stressed _comma_  excited and hopeful for the future .  do you have kids?
i do not yet but hope to one day .  i think you will be a great parent! 
thank you .  we have been trying for a year .  
i was just speaking with my buddy .  he is very over wight and somehow finished a marathon last weekend .  impressive!
wow yes it is 
i couldn t believe it .  just the day before we were crushing cheese steaks . 
he probably stored that up for his energy for the race
i guess _comma_  i;m sure he eat again after that .  he loves food .  if he can do it i know i can run one . 
my friend stayed awake for    hours studying for the mcat! 
haha oh wow _comma_  how was that for them
she did well actually _comma_  i was impressed with how well she managed to do despite lack of sleep!
thats great _comma_  im glad she did well
i was commuting to work and a driver cut me off
i hate it when that happens! were you ok?
i made it out ok _comma_  just so irritating
i always wonder what goes through peoples heads when that happens . 
i was busy due to work and visited my family for the first time in awhile
that sounds nice! did you have fun
it was great _comma_  felt refreshing to be around them
i m glad you enjoyed yourself _comma_  it is important to make time for family . 
i get so annoyed with people who say one thing and do something else .  my boss is one of those people .  i wish there was just instance that i could be like this is where he annoyed me _comma_  but that isn t the case .  it happens every day .  
i m sorry to hear you re having to deal with that
yeah _comma_  it can get annoying at times .  i just stir clear of him when he is around .  
sounds like the best thing to do honestly
i have an   hour shift in the office today but i can t wait to go home to see my boyfriend! 
you will survive _comma_  and you have something to look forward to
exactly _comma_  it s keeping me going since i m not feeling to good today!
i hope your work day goes by fast
when i was       _comma_     i got ran over by a truck .  i was with my older cousin and his car messed up .  since he was my hero    _comma_     i listened to everything he said    _comma_     so when he told me to get the truck rolling and jump in .  i listened .  however    _comma_     my    year old legs didn t make it and got trapped under the truck
oh wow that is so scary .   i can t believe he asked someone so young to do that . 
well   _comma_    he was    at the time   _comma_    so in his defense   _comma_    he just was being a  dumb teenager  .  my parents never let me go with him again after that though .  
i really hope you didn t have any lasting effects from the injury?
i only got a b  on an assignment i worked really hard on recently _comma_  but i m working even harder now studying to ace the exam! 
wow! i m sorry to hear that .  do you think you will get an a this time?
 i do actually! 
congratulations! studying can be hard _comma_  but sometimes it s about technique rather than time spent .  are you doing anything different this time?
i was inspecting rooms yesterday when i bent down to look under a bed _comma_  i felt the back of my pants tear .  the hole was the entire back of my pants .  
oh no! i m so sorry! i hate when that happens!
yes _comma_  i have a staff of    and i think each one saw me at some point in the day .  i have khaki s on .  i had to tape and staple the hole .  
ugh! that s the worst! too bad you couldn t run home and change!
that would have been nice .  but home is an hour each way .  
i had to compose myself and pull over to remove the spider .  i m so thankful that i didn t freak out and crash the car . 
oh that sounds so scary!
it was very scary _comma_  i m terrified of spiders .  what are you afraid of?
i hate snakes! they are like little evil creatures . 
so as i ve gotten older over the last    years .  i gained    pounds .  my wife has me on a diet but every night when she goes to bed i have a bowl of ice cream .  
don t even tlak about diets . i miss the times i was young and could eat all i wanted
yea but those times are behind us .  tonight for dinner was a kale salad .  it was gross but i ve gotten a dish or rocky road with my name on it later .  i do feel bad for lying to her but i need it . 
ugh . so boring . what wrong with being fat . at least they are all happy . 
i think i m average .  i m           .  it could be worse .  i still exercise a lot .  perhaps i need to enjoy the ice cream more and try to feel less guilty .   
did you ever attend college? i just completed my bachelor s degree and i m feeling really good about my future!
yes _comma_  i have an associate s in nursing . 
wow that s great you must enjoy helping others! 
yes _comma_  it s been a great career .   how exciting for you to be about yours .   congratulations!
have you ever felt sandpaper on your bottom? because that is what the new recycled toilet paper my wife want s us to use feels like .  
holy smokes! let me guess _comma_  better for the environment?
yes but in the end it s still paper and still going to the same place .  i dream of the day i can enjoy angel soft or charmin again . 
you poor soul! i m all for saving the planet _comma_  but you have to draw the line somewhere .  i hope you get some relief!
i m going to have to start waiting until i go to work to use the potty . 
i scored a    on my promotion exam _comma_  i was upset that i missed one question . 
but that is an awesome grade!  you should be so proud!!!
thank you _comma_  i am definitely proud! when was your last exam?
oh _comma_  it s been years since i ve taken an exam!  perhaps the last one was a para pro exam to help out in the local schools when my kids were younger   but they didn t even give me the grade   it was a pass fail type exam (the horror of not knowing the grade though!!)
on the way from work i hit     in my vw on the autobahn .  i was well impressed with the car . 
i love the autobahn . 
i ve been faster in my old audi but this little car is a   cylinder and still super fast . 
yes i use to own an audio . 
awesome _comma_  it s time to buy another . 
last weekend i did something big .  i finished my first     mile iron man race .  i m still pumped . 
i have never done that _comma_  good job . 
that s it was a bucket list item and the hardest thing i have ever done but now i want to do it again . 
you should .  when is the next one . 
this fall .  i m need to train more .  it was a    mile running race _comma_     mile swim and the rest on bikes .  so much fun!
last night i was looking at my things i have in a storage locker and found a tub filled with my grandfathers things .  the good memories came flooding back . 
oh wow thats cool . 
yes _comma_  he s been gone    years but i still think of him daily .  it s strange how someone can make such an impact on someone for so long .  
thats good you still think of him . 
yes _comma_  he was my hero and still is i guess .  
i went to a school for massage therapy _comma_  but i was worried at first that it would be strange to massage people i didn t know .  
thats cool .  was it hard?
some of it was .  i had to learn the name  _comma_   attachment point  _comma_   and action of every muscle in the body .  there are over     .  
wow that is a lot . 
i think i get it from my mom .  she would never open the door for uninvited guests . 
what do you get from your mom?
being bothered by uninvited guests
i don t like uninvited guests either! so annoying!
some people think it s ridiculous to have a problem with that _comma_  but i adore my privacy and space . 
my first dog was a dalmatian .  we adopted her and then went right to a soccer game before i even had time to play with her .  
i love dalmatians . 
she was a great dog! that game felt so so long though .  i had to watch her sitting with my parents while i played .  
how old was she . 
  weeks when we got her .  
i have a friend who is always complaining .  she always has to make it sound like her life is harder than everyone else s .  
well maybe it is but it could also just be she s spoiled . 
i didn t know her when she was young _comma_  so she could be .  i think she just likes to be miserable .  
does she have like some other issues like mentally?
i wouldn t be surprised .  
have you ever put a pair of shoes on your feet that felt so sweet that made your sole happy?
i have a pair of fuzzy slippers that make me feel pretty cozy and happy in . 
yea _comma_  i had that but recently my shoes wore out and they no longer make them .  i m so sad!
that is the worse  _comma_   you finally find a brand and fit that perfect and they discontinue making them that is the worst  _comma_   happens to me all the time . 
yes _comma_  i was angry and sad . 
so did you end up finding a shoe that you could live with and that was close to the ones you had _comma_  or have you been unsuccessful?
nope _comma_  i gave up on shoes all together .  
i was on lunch and my coworker made me laugh .  i pee ed my self .  i felt like i wanted to die . 
wow _comma_  did they notice?
yep _comma_  to make it worse i m the boss .  i m pregnant so i tried to pass it off like the baby was pressing on my bladder .  
they will forget about it soon . 
the next day someone had put a diaper in my desk . 
becasue of a certain person who worked at the corner grocery i became uneasy to shop there . 
i am so sorry to hear that .  what did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there?
they were a friend and customer of mine in a small business and cheated me out of a large sum of money . 
that s the worst! you think you can trust people _comma_  and then they stab you in the back .  i don t blame you for not wanting to see them again . 
i just found out my new insurance is going to cover my big dental surgery coming up .  no more bad jibbers!
that is great .  that should be good insurance .  are you generaly happy with it?
yes  _comma_   they are covering     _comma_      worth of work .  i only have to pay      total .  i can t wait to have good teeth .  
that is nice .  good luck with the sugery . 
thanks _comma_  i m a little scared but it will be worth it .  being from the uk bad teeth are in my genes . 
i have a solo trip coming up .  i m going to colorado to climb mt .  elbert solo .  it s the tallest mountain in the united states . 
i love colorado _comma_  my favorite state . 
yes me two .  i used to live in colorado .  i have not been up a mountain that big in years _comma_  i m getting the belly butterfly s .  
i wish i could live there . 
it was a great place to live but very expensive and winter was rough . 
last weekend i was on a date with a wonderful guy but right after dinner i got bad gas . 
did you fart?
it sounded like trumpets were filling the room .  he looked like he wanted to puke each and ever time .  
did they smell?
have you ever drove past a cow farm or garage dump? yes _comma_  well those smell better then i did that night .  
we had a hail storm about a month ago .  it ruined our roof so we are trying to find a good roofing company to replace it .  
did anyone get hurt?
no _comma_  thank goodness .  just a lot of car and property damage in the area .  
thats good _comma_  as long as no one got hurt . 
my husband just ran a marathon .  he had no training i was blown away by him .  true inspiration! 
no training at all!  wow _comma_  that s pretty impressive .   how far is a marathon?
   .   miles .  he walks about    miles a day at work so that s some training sorta . 
that s still pretty impressive .   i bet he was proud of himself also!  does he plan to do it again and will you maybe do it with him?
he wants to do an iron man .      .   miles  _comma_   running  _comma_   biking and swimming . 
wow   he certainly is adventurous and determined .   i bet he will do amazing . 
yes _comma_  i m well impressed with him .  
i don t like saying this  _comma_   and this is the first time i have but a few days ago i drove by my ex wife and mine house  _comma_   and for a few seconds it made me nostalgic .  
wow you are brave . 
yes _comma_  it was only a fleeting moment but it was there .  
i bet you drove fast . 
i m going skydiving this weekend .  i m afraid of heights and freaking out a little . 
oh my! that sounds exciting for sure! i couldn t do it _comma_  i don t think . 
yea _comma_  until this morning when i called and put down a deposit i did not think i could either . 
have you ever done anything else so frightening?
yes _comma_  i love doing something crazy and the feeling i get from it .  
i would say that you re an adventurous person .  me _comma_  i m more laid back and mellow .  kudos to you and have fun!
that s i m so scared but it will be worth it .  you only have one life so don t hold back . 
can you believe that i learned to ride a bike at age   ?
at least you did it .  lance armstrong did not learn until he was    . 
really? i didn t know that .  is there anything that you d say you were a late bloomer for?
love _comma_  it took me    years with the same person to build up the courage to ask her to marry me .  
well congratulations for taking your time _comma_  look at it that way . 
yes not if i can just calm the nerves for this skydiving trip . 
maybe try controlled breathing exercises _comma_  i m sure you ll be fine and want to do it again . 
hope so .  i don t do well with heights . 
i had a huge exam that like    percent of my grade .  i study for   weeks for it
oh _comma_  i bet that was very stressful and difficult .  i hope you did well on it?
yeah because the professor got mad that the book store didn t have the little blue books to write in _comma_  so he canceled it and said whatever our current grade was to bump it up a letter grade
well  _comma_   at least you didn t go down in your grade .  but  _comma_   it wasn t right to treat the students like that!
as i get older i ve fully accepted who i am .  i m not here to impress .  it makes life easier when you think like this . 
that is good _comma_  how old are you?
   so not super old or super young .  just happy with who i am . 
i am    so same generation . 
have you stopped caring yet? about others opinions? 
got a pizza last night .  it gave me food poison .  now i m stilling here sick and angry . 
oh gosh _comma_  i am sorry .  did you let the pizza place know? 
yes _comma_  i called and they laughed at me .  told me it was the new pizza buy and that he must have used old cheese or something .  
wow! in that instance _comma_  i would prefer them to lie to me than to laugh and be like i knowingly fed you bad food .  
yes _comma_  for the first    hours i just had to lay in the bathroom floor in pain . 
i had studied for an exam for several days _comma_  so i was confident when i strolled into class because i knew i would ace it
and did you knock it out of the park? 
uh   _comma_    i made a b on it   _comma_     so it was a false sense of confidence   _comma_    lol
perhaps be less cocky next time? either way b s get degree s .  
when my son was   years old   _comma_    he had to have his tonsils taken out .  i thought it would be nothing   _comma_    but when they went to take him back   _comma_    i got so anxious .  
was he okay? i ve never heard of that going wrong . 
yeah   _comma_    he was fine   _comma_    but i had read a few horror stories online .  i knew i shouldn t   _comma_    but i did .  
that s where you went wrong lol .  i m glad he was fine .  i would ve been scared if it were one of my kids too .  surgery is still surgery . 
my neighbors are still doing fireworks every night around midnight .  scares my dogs and they can t sleep through it .  
oh _comma_  i bet that could be frightening for your dogs .  did you try to complain to them?
we don t know them well  _comma_   but if they do it again tonight we probably will .  i understand on the  th and even a couple of days after  _comma_   but some people have to get up for work .  
i think they have some leftover fireworks that they don t want to sit on .  they should just use them next time . 
my dog had bone cancer and we had to put her down .  it was a very sad _comma_  but necessary decision .  
it takes a strong and compassionate person to make that kind of decision . 
it was very hard _comma_  but she was suffering .  our vet was very helpful and we did ask him if he thought it was too soon .  he assured us that it was not .  
she had a happy life .  i m sure she understands . 
my mom is here visiting me and my family .  it has been a really fun visit .  
sounds nice .  how long has it been since you ve seen her?
about seven months .  too long .  
oh wow .  that is a long time .  do you live far apart?
yes _comma_  about a    hour drive .  
we had a really great guest speaker at work today . 
that s awesome! what did they talk about?
he was a retired fbi agent who talked about his experiences in the field in the      s . 
fascinating! what kind of work do you do?
i m a role player that trains law enforcement by acting as victims or suspects . 
sounds like it was very exciting!
yeah he talked about his toughest cases and some funny storties about suspects who incriminated themselves with simple linguistic tricks . 
i am a bit breaking bad fan and love better call saul .  season   starts in august .  
me too! i also iike staying home all day . 
i wonder what will happen this season .  i m expecting it to be really nail biting .  
i have more time to watch movies and shows on netflix alot .  i stay home with my little one year old during the day . 
i came home today and someone had eaten my leftovers .  i was so irritated!
i hate when that happens!  i look forward to those all day you know!  did you find out who the culprit was?
yes _comma_  it was my partner .  he owes me big time
i think that calls for a nice steak dinner out   on his dime!
right! he says i m greedy anyway _comma_  but that s besides the point!
i got into some serious financial troubles a few years back . 
it happens to everyone _comma_  are you out of it now?
yeah but what i did was terrible .  i was self employed and i manipulated the system so i received money i was not owed  .  my husband helped me out of the jam once i came clean about aht i did . 
oh well _comma_  it was nice to have someone to help you . 
do you like fair rides? i can t take them myself . 
i don t like them at all .  i ve seen too many videos on the internet where people get injured or they break easily
yes _comma_  i remember in      a teen was decapitated at six flags in atlanta . 
yeah that is terrifying .  the smaller country fairs are worse .  i bet they have no one really checking up on them except the carney folk . 
i just don t think they re safe enough _comma_  many rides at the small carnivals are rickety and wobbly . 
yeah _comma_  and the people in charge don t get paid enough to always check up and repair them
i ll just stick to the food and go home .  funnel cakes and polish sausages are my favs . 
two years ago  _comma_   i discovered that my now ex wife was cheating on me with someone she worked with .  when i first discovered it  _comma_   i was angry and hurt . 
i bet you were _comma_  i did that to my husband when i was young .  i thought it was the solution to relief from abuse . 
i know it was a horrible experience at the time _comma_  now i think its the greatest thing to ever happen to me .  sleeping in different beds for   years isn t healthy .  it took that to wake me up
i guess that was what you call a temporary situation .  sometimes moving on is required . 
i wish i could go back to the    s for a little while at times .  
don t you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them
that s nothing but the truth! what s your favorite era?
don t you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them
do you have a favorite era?
probably the mid to late   s .  this is going to be hilarious but my one memory from that era is when i first heard brittany spears hit me baby one more time song .  it changed my life
did you graduate high school? it s a lot harder than most people think . 
sure i did! it takes determation to succeed
i didn t think i woudl have to do that much studying .  i figured that came later in college .  
so if not by studying  _comma_ what else?
i hit my toe on the edge of the doorway and it bent backwards .  i was furious and crying at the same time!
that must have hurt a lot . did you go to the hospital? 
no  _comma_   i don t have insurance .  just like when i twisted my ankle on the stairs and fell .  it took months to heal  _comma_   but it healed . 
you are very accident prone . you should get an insurance right away . 
that s hilarious! i can t afford it right now though .  i ll just be more careful . 
sometimes we can get a phone call that shakes us to the core . 
that is so true .  and sometimes that phone call can be a trip of a life time!
my phone call was my mom telling me my    year old had just died of a heart attack while at her house . 
oh my goodness! once things settle down i will give you the info about our cruise .  it will help you relax like it did me!
i can t believe my husband planned this all by himself! my mind is still blown by this!
sounds so exciting .  what did he plan?
we are going to mexico .  i have mixed feelings _comma_  but mostly excited!
when and how? are you flying or driving? just because or is it your anniversary?
it s our   th anniversary .  we are making the drive to fl since we live in georgia .  
don t you hate when you have to give stuff away and then can t? well  _comma_   that happened to me recently .  i was going to give away some of my son s old toys  _comma_   but started looking at then and realized that i need to keep them for no other reason than that i was being sentimental 
that s too funny .  you know _comma_  i m the exact same way .  i get so nostalgic with my old things .  can never throw them away!
i know! i am always like i need this notebook that has my  rd grade handwriting back from the   s because it will be very useful someday .  lol
yes _comma_  someday .  haha .  i love looking back at those kinds of things .  it brings back so many good memories .  such a good feeling
i was looking through some of my old pictures a week or so ago _comma_  and saw a picture of my grandmother who passed away a few years ago
i m sorry to hear that .  were you two very close?
yes  _comma_   we were .  i used to spend my summer vacations with her when my parents were out of town  _comma_   so it allowed me to get really close with her . 
that s sweet _comma_  i had the same experience with my own grandma too .  god bless y all!
i was frozen in fear at the gym monday _comma_  when a guy started seizing .  he got so violent and ran away from paramedics . 
wow _comma_  that must have been challenging for everyone! was he okay ultimately? was someone able to help him?
they couldn t capture him _comma_  he jumped the fence by the pool and rolled down a hill .  i don t know what happened to him . 
that is frightening! hopefully nothing you ll have to deal with again!
i hope not! i m not good with crisis situations at all!
yes _comma_  i was surprise on how he changed to another talk
what was the initial talk?
i should descript how i could feel when am lonely
so how do you feel when lonely?
wow _comma_  the situation is always very bad
it is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great _comma_  and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn t you on your wife s computer .  makes for a wonderful day!
maybe she does not have the hots for you anymore . 
it is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great _comma_  and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn t you on your wife s computer .  makes for a wonderful day!
yes _comma_  i understood the first time . 
oh    _comma_     sorry    _comma_     i meant to say ex wife .  i am so glad she didn t .  the years haven t be kind to her    _comma_     so got out just at the right time    _comma_     lol
i slipped on a puddle in the mall once .  i was so embarrassed that i pretended i was hurt badly . 
i know the feeling .  once i fell in high school from a puddle and laughed it off even though i was hurt _comma_ 
even animals get embarrassed _comma_  i ve seen it in my cats . 
oh really? i haven t seen that in an animal as of yet .  that s pretty interesting . 
yes _comma_  my cat fell from the mantle above the fireplace and looked totally embarrassed . 
oh dang _comma_  talk about a fall! if i were your cat i d be embarrassed too! lol
one day my girlfriend told me about a guy that works with her and she mentioned how hilarious he was which then made me think of a meme that i read about how funny guys will make you laugh and then all of a sudden you don t have clothes on .  it was only for a split second but it happened
that is a hilarious intro  _comma_   thank you for that! so were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous? (and you re very insightful   intelligent if you say yes! though being both of those things  _comma_   you have nothing to worry about ; ))
well   _comma_    i most def want to be insightful and intelligent   _comma_    so i will say yes .  i know i had nothing to worry about   _comma_    but it is crazy how in those instances when you least expect it a ridiculous meme shots into your brain and you start playing  along came polly  sceneros in your head .  
these references are perfect .  and your girlfriend must enjoy you very much .  mazel tov _comma_  you crazy kids!
lately  _comma_   my two year old boy has been so much into wearing dresses and playing with babie dolls  _comma_  i don t even want to think of i
is that good or bad? why the concern?
i think it is bad
ok why do you think so?
boys are meant to be playing with car toys not dolls . 
it is such a privilege to be able to help someone in any way you can . 
indeed .  it makes you feel good when you can help somebody else with their problem
it also makes me feel bad when i m unable to help . 
i think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another _comma_  we would not have much problem
that is so true! there is no reason for there to be a problem with famine in the world . 
my math teacher told the class i needed to do better on my next test . 
well you should try to study more and see what happens
i did  _comma_   i can t remember  _comma_   i either made an a or a b in there . 
well maybe you should talk about getting a tutor or somethinf
well        _comma_         this isn t going to make me sound like the manliest individual ever        _comma_         but i think i need to tell it to someone .  a few weeks ago        _comma_         i was driving home from work .  it was late .  i was tired .  so i wasn t my usual self .  i was singing along to some song when all of a sudden i glanced up and saw two eyes looking back at me        _comma_         and at the time i didn t know whos eyes they were so i was scared to death .  i slammed on my breaks        _comma_         in the middle of the road        _comma_         jumped out        _comma_         and was ready to run .  i mean fight whoever was in my back seat .  long story short        _comma_         i saw my own reflection in the mirror .  
that is terrifying .  until the end of your story .  then i laughed so hard i cried .  but that is so relatable .  i ve been terrified of my own shadow more than once . 
it seems to happen to me at least once a week .  if i watch a scary movie or show then it happens at least every other day until i forget about it _comma_  lol
that s hilarious _comma_  but i also feel bad for you .  perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie?
i have gotten better .  i don t have to sleep in my parents bed anymore .  granted  _comma_   i am    now  _comma_   lol
haha hey i would sneak into my parents bed even as a teenager when i was scared _comma_  especially during storms . 
why no response?
i m supposed to wait for you to start .  :) 
is my response not good enough?
you haven t said anything yet other than asking why i hadn t responded .  sorry i m a little lost as to what i was supposed to respond to?
se
it is really hot here most of the year . 
really?  where do you live at?
alabama .  it s winter for about   weeks . 
i feel your pain .   i live in orlando _comma_  florida .   so im in the same boat . 
ok i was in walmart buying a video game when this dud eshows up and immediately questions my selection .  like it s some kind of internet forum!
that is so annoying . who he thinks he is???
i dunno  _comma_   but i just said  that s great  _comma_   bro  and left .   then he follows me to the checkout counter to continue giving me crap about it . 
i would be scared of a guy like that . 
well i just got incensed with him and told the clerk to do something about him or i m not shopping there anymore .   he was told to leave . 
this was several years back .  i was single   _comma_    but i also like watching the notebook type of movie   _comma_    so i thought it would be okay to go watch the vow alone .  wrong! horrible mistake .  it was a tear jerker   _comma_    and i had no one there to see it and be like awe .  all those tears wasted for nothing! lol
aww .  sorry to hear that .  i haven t personally seen the show .  what hit you the most?
oh     _comma_      it was a movie about a woman who lost her memory     _comma_      and her husband had to get her to fall back in love with him .  at the time     _comma_      i was like i want that; however     _comma_      now that i am in a relationship     _comma_      i am like i don t know about this .  i wish she would get amnesia as well
sounds like a touching but sad story .  love without two ways interaction is really hard .  i can t imagine myself going through relationship like this honestly . 
i was joyful because my grandad shared the gospel with me when i was    . 
you mean nostalgic?
i guess i am nostalgic now . 
what your grand father did to you was very special . 
he read a tract to me .  he explained god s love for me with pictures in a way i could understand . 
can you believe that my neighbors downstairs allow their dog to relieve itself in the street?
that is not very considerate or respectful _comma_  plus the dog could get hurt if a vehicle were traveling down the street . 
that s what i m afraid of as well! but the dog seems to only want to use it that way .  do you like your neighbors?
i live in the country _comma_  so i do not have neighbors that live close .  
how fortunate _comma_  my grandparents lived in the country .  i would always be scared at night thinking of their scary stories .  
i sometimes get freaked out _comma_  but getting freaked out every now and then is better than having to deal with neighbors .  
that s true .  you can live in peace . 
yes .  peace is key . 
i regret drinking way too much soda .  now my teeth look bad . 
uhmmnn! cut down on the intake

this is a silly story   _comma_    but it reminds me how confident teenagers can be .  when i got my first tattoo   _comma_    for some reason   _comma_    it gave me this false sense of confidence .  i am not sure why other than at the time i thought my tribal tattoo was something to admire
do you have a tribal tattoo .  how does it look like?
i got it when i was    .  i didn t take care of it  _comma_   so now it looks like a shady prison tattoo  _comma_   lol

a co worker at work needed some money for a drink  _comma_   but i didnt have any cash  _comma_   so i let them have my debit card to go buy them something
i think i would have just said i didn t have any cash and let that be the end of it . 
not really .  the individual kind of seemed shady as well _comma_  but my debit card has a feature that allows me to turn it off
i never expected to fail my final exams _comma_ that is a major blow for me .

were there any signs that the driver might have been impared _comma_  as opposed to the breaks malfunctioning?
no  _comma_   the driver was okay  _comma_   the problem was with the breaks
i hope the child recovers from her injuries . 
one time somebody ran into our brick mailbox with their car and knocked a few bricks off .

oh really _comma_  that was hectic for you i guess
it really was _comma_  and a missed opportunity to cut my costs .

you need to calm down and focus so that you can pass the exam

i lied because  _comma_   had it been i told  her first  _comma_   she wouldn t have agreed
oh about what exactly? are you talking about family or friend or so?
i went out with my friends
ah ok _comma_  was it fun then?
do you ever feel sad about anything?
oh yeah _comma_  i ve been through quite a few sad things before .  what about you?
yeah some .  it s a part of life i guess . 
definitely _comma_  the sad is needed to balance out the good . 
i am afraid of hospitals since my cousing was admitted due to injuries in a road accident .  i saw alot of blood and sick people and the thought of going there scares me .  
i figure we ll all be there at some point once we get old . 
i dont want to imagine
my parents worked in them _comma_  so i am used to them . 
my cat disappeared _comma_  we figure it died . 
oooh  _comma_   sorry about that  _comma_   what happened
i was the last person to look after it when people were on vacation for about a week .  i feel bad cause for a couple of those days i didn t crack the garage door . 
sorry _comma_  i hope you areokay now
the house was so quiet  _comma_   and if i talk  _comma_   it will echo
where you the only one in the house?
oh yes _comma_  i would have gone out with my best friend but she went on a holiday
wow _comma_  that s nice!
i had an important high school race .  and i left my shoes at home . 
wow _comma_  that s a big mess up! how did that turn out?
i got my second best time at the distance after borrowing someone else s shoes . 
good thing you found someone who had as big of feet as you do!
i was amazed because i thought he had no money _comma_  i was not expecting it
why? what was the unexpected thing that happened?
that he bought me a watch _comma_  not just a watch but gold
who bought you this golden watch? was it a wizard?
one time at work i put together a shelf that had nonmatching parts . 
oh? is it more of art than purpose in its form? 
it s more like there were leftover parts and we made do with what we had . 
oh _comma_  i see .  a workable shelf then .  
it was a happy moment that day i checked my result _comma_  i was so afraid but later it varnished
hahaha hope you did very well
of course _comma_  very excellent result
that s good .   i did well too
i was very expectant of money last week
so _comma_  did you get it?
noo _comma_  but hopefully i will get it this week
that is cool .  definitely you will
one time i was driving my car at it s maximum speed potential because i was late for a meeting . 
wow _comma_  and you didn t get pulled over?
no _comma_  i had not tried to max it out .  but at    it pretty much shook and wouldn t go faster . 
must ve been some important meeting!
i was flogged very well that day
i don t know what flogging is . 
wow _comma_  i mean i was disciplined
looking up the definition tells me its punishment by being whipped or beaten  _comma_   so unless you mean you were beaten metaphorically  _comma_   you shouldn t be  wowing  me . 
i was amazed with the good performance i put up on stage yesterday 
well done _comma_  what type of performance was it?
dance performance 
was it a ballet .  i enjoy watching dance performances . 
really _comma_  she surprised me .  i was so happy
what did she surprise you with?
by helping me with my chores _comma_  even without me asking
amazing! thats really nice
i was really hungry and ready to eat 
what do u want to eat?
noodles i guess
ok _comma_ have u prepared it?
she was told that she will give birth through cs _comma_  but she delivered normal
normal is the best way _comma_  it helps the mother bond with the child
exactly _comma_  and it helps the woman heal fast . 
we are adamant to have our baby born normal .  i have seen first hand the cs mothers and their closeness (lack of) with their kids
so many relationships are being spoilt by cheating and  unfaithfulness 
you think so? 
yeah cox i ve been in that situation before
well   _comma_    i ve kept quite a few relationships throughout my life .  if i actually wanted to look at online profiles   _comma_    i do it mostly for research or investigative purposes .  other than that   _comma_    i m only interested in online chat .  
i needed money this weekend 
why _comma_  what do you have planned?
wanted to go see a movie with my girlfriend 
sounds like fun!  i hope you find the money to do it . 
i got a job interview for a very prestigious company .   i spent weeks studying and researching them then had my interview this morning . 
great! you must be well prepared .  are you nervous?
no actually i was feeling very positive as i had done so much research .   during the interview i was able to answer the questions with ease and my courage just grew and grew .   i left feeling on top of the world as it had gone so well!
yes it sounds like you did everything right .   i hope you hear back from them soon about a job offer . 
i just did and i got the job! i think i will be going on for a celebration tonight . 
i needed money last week and was very expectant of money 
did you get what you needed?
nooo but i got a little
well that s better than nothing at all :)
i had the worst day ever yesterday .   i started early and was half asleep getting ready .   i just grabbed to pumps and put them on my feet but when i got to work my male colleague pointed out that i had infact put two odd shoes on!!
oh no _comma_  i ve had a few days like that .  did you laugh it off?
not really i was just mortified!! one shoe was plain black and the other had a pink bow on it at the front .   i had to walk about all day while the whole office couldnt stop laughing .   i think by the end of the day though i tried to see the funny side . 
well good on you for toughing it out .  your the stronger for it . 
lol i dont know about that but i have definitely learnt to always have one last check of what im wearing before i ever leave the house again!!
that food was my last hope _comma_  i was so hungry that day
what kin of food was it?
pasta food .  i felt bad
i love pasta
i passed all my papers _comma_  even my teachers were proud of me

that is great
oh yeah _comma_  my parents bought me special gift because of my success
how nice
very good one _comma_  gold watch
wow that is very nice
i was really lonely sitting alone in the train
that sucks .  sometimes it doesn t matter if you re surrounded by people _comma_  you can still feel alone
yeah most especially when you have no friend around
the hardest lesson in life is that we re all alone
went for a music concert yesterday 
awesome .  what type of music was played there?
hip pop  mostly _comma_   they invited beyonce but she didn t show up 
oh my god .  that s so cool .  hope the ticket was not expensive?
he actually came back with a gold medal _comma_  i was actually doubting him for a while . 
who came back with a gold medal? 
my friend _comma_  he won the     metre sprint carnival . 
oh   _comma_    nice .  well   _comma_    if you work upon on something   _comma_    anything is possible if you work upon it .  
yes _comma_  because that s how i feel about it . 
hello friend! may i ask what it that you feel that way about?
it encourage to be impressed . 
i don t understand what you are talking about .  are you feeling okay today?
you need to be happy for you to live longer
of course  _comma_   like they say happiness is contagious  _comma_   if you are happy everything around you stays happy and it will be hard to die young
yeah for sure _comma_  that s why i always like to be happy 
also your home stays blessed because you become a more better partner
my roommate and i used to plan for weeks to prepare for music festivals!

i m glad you did!  i had a tumor removed _comma_  and it was not cancerous!
oh wow _comma_  i am glad that you are okay . 
the other night i went outside to unplug the pool pump and saw a snake .  we have poisonous snakes around us so i was a bit worried when i saw it .  
omg i would have ran faster than forest gump .  what did you do? 
i ran inside and got my husband out of bed .  he killed it since we have little kids we didn t want to take a risk that it was poisonous .  
im glad no one was hurt! 
i was on facebook and my memories popped up reminding me that i lost my dog to bone cancer three years ago . 
oh no _comma_  i m sure that was a hard memory to have brought up for you .  
it was _comma_  she was a very special dog .  one of the old souls with a heart of gold .  i still miss her . 
what was her name? have you read rainbow bridge?
yes _comma_  it is a beautiful poem! her name was skyber .  
what a beautiful name! hopefully your memories are more happy than sad now . 
i am so happy i was able to pass my teacher certification test and become an english teacher . 
that s great .  teachers are so important . 
it s such a fulfilling job .  the test was difficult _comma_  but i spent a lot of my free time studying for it . 
i wanted to become a teacher before .  i was afraid of how hard it would be . 
it s a lot of work  _comma_   but if you really put in the effort  _comma_   it becomes much easier . 
well congratulations! i hope your students appreciate you as much as they should . 
i was in a back room in our house and everyone else was asleep .  i heard a weird crinkling noise and was worried that someone had come in the house .  
oh my goodness _comma_  did you go to check what the noise was?
i did _comma_  it turned out to be my cat playing with a play mat the kids left out .  
i m glad it wasn t anything serious! it s scary how quick our mind goes to the worst possible scenarios . 
when i turned    i got my first surprise party thanks to my parents . 
that s really cool of them .  you weren t expecting it at all _comma_  hu?
no .  i just thought we were going to an early dinner together .  
parents can be great sometimes .  did you have a good time?
i found some old keepsakes in my parents basement and it made me feel nostalgic 
what did you find?
old toys  _comma_   sports equipment  _comma_   video games etc
i love old school video games .  what were your favorites?
chrono trigger was my favorite
for my current job _comma_  i thought about interview answers that i did poorly on before .  i was able to ace this interview and have been there for three years!
congratulations .  interviews can be stressful
true .  the interview i had before i got this job went so _comma_  so badly .  i studied some common questions so i was ready the next time . 
thats smart .  and it worked . 
my puppy is turning   years old next month .  the day i adopted her was one of the best days of my life . 
nice .  what is his name?
churro .  he s a boxer mix . 
nice .  i like dogs . 
i went zip lining in thailand once .  a nearby tree fell and part of it hit the platform we were on . 
oh my that sounds so scary! was everyone ok?
we were all fine .  a bit shaken up _comma_  but nobody got hurt thank goodness . 
do you think you will ever zip line again?
oh yes .  it was a great experience . 
my son experienced stranger anxiety and didn t want to be out in public . 
oh no .  what do you do for that?
we had to leave the restaurant before everyone could order drinks . 
oh .  how old is he?
he is one and it was sad because i stay at home all day so that was my chance for some interaction . 
today as soon as i got to work i got sick .  i have a new coworker that stepped in and helped me out .  her works looks good but i m nervous . 
well _comma_  i hope you are feeling better .  what makes you so nervous? are you worried your superiors will look down on you leaving early?
no we are allowed to help each other but i m worried his code will not pass once the program is done .  
i m sure you can get in tomorrow and see how it looks .  you can work together to make sure it works!
i work so .  i want to trust him but we have only worked together a few weeks .  
i just upgraded the turbo on my car .  i wanted more power but currently my vw can beat a corvette in a race .  so i m happy
that is very cool! how much did it cost?
i did all the work my self but the parts were around      besides the price off the all work i ve all ready done to it .  i m trying to build a grocery getter that i can take to the race track . 
wow _comma_  sounds nice! was it hard to do the work?
not really i enjoy working on cars .  i work a white collar job so i went off work i like to do something different .  
hired   more people to join my crew at work last week .    all ready quit .  i m bummed .  
dang _comma_  that really stinks .  why did they quit so quickly?
the  work was to physically hard for them .  but i still had big hopes for them .  
perhaps you should screen new employees better? like give them a physical performance test?
i wish .  it s hard to find anyone that is willing to work hard . 
we are supposed to do the amusement park _comma_  tomorrow but i think it may rain . 
i hope it s nice for you .  do you have any alternate plans?
we do _comma_  but i think my friends want to do the amusement park as well as something else .  i don t know if i have money for both . 
well  _comma_   that s always a problem for me too  _comma_   but at least you ve got another    .    now . 
hello! i recently read an article about medical marijuana now being allowed in the united kingdom _comma_  what do you think about it?
i think that is wonderful _comma_  it s about time more countries and states are making this medicine an option . 
the way it ended up being legalized      _comma_       imo      _comma_       was a complete disgrace      _comma_       they confiscated some childs weed who was epileptic      _comma_       and as a result   predictably   he immediately started having seizured without it .  like gee      _comma_       well done on torturing the kid! do you think it was right to confiscate it      _comma_       even though it technically wasnt legal at the time?
no  _comma_   but as mark twain once said  _comma_   the law is an ass .  
what an excellent quote 
i m glad they made the right decision eventually though .  it s about time!
the coolest race i saw was a high school      meter relay . 
the coolest race i saw was late at night on the highway out of town . 
i am a bad driver _comma_  otherwise i might like it . 
yeah  _comma_   it can be pretty dangerous  _comma_   but i was young . 
sometimes i race after the stop light _comma_  but that s it . 
my hamster donatello just died . 
i m sorry to hear that .  how long did you have him? 
i had him for two years .  he was my best friend . 
i bet pets are amazing .  they re hard to replace once they re a part of the family
exactly _comma_  i just don t know how i m going to get over it .  i don t want another hamster i want donatello back . 
i cant believe my brother snitched on me .  he told my girlfriend i cheated on her . 
oooh _comma_  that s rough .  did you make him mad?
no _comma_  he just doesn t understand the meaning of loyalty . 
well _comma_  i hope you can work things out at least
i didnt like flying abroad
flying has seemingly become terrible these days .  what about your trip was so bad?
it was snowingh really bad and the plane had to land in sc instead of chicago
that sounds frustrating and a little scary .   did you eventually make it to your destination?
no _comma_  i decided to cancel and eventually went home next day . it was the best idea . 
that s too bad .   but better safe than sorry . 
yea that was the idea .  go back to safety zone .  no place like home .  have you traveled much ?
not too much .   i used to fly a lot but not anymore .   i stick around home now mostly . 
i miss beating my brother in the pokemon card game everyday . 
well _comma_  have you tried reliving that through the pokemon app that you can interact with?
no _comma_  i need the real thing it just doesn t feel the same . 
yes _comma_  i can understand that .  sometimes nothing compares .  have you guys played recently?
my boyfriend had to go out of town for a few days and i was left alone in the apartment .  i didn t have many friends here at the time . 
i know how that feels .  i bet it was boring and lonely . 
yeah _comma_  it was .  i didn t have much to do all that weekend and the apartment was quiet . 
did you get out and do anything?
my son starts kindergarten next month .  i don t know what i will do since i don t work . 
that really is a big change for you! are you excited to have some more down time?
i am but also not sure how i feel like him  leaving the nest  .  
yeah _comma_  that feeling will change when you see him coming home with a huge smile on his face!
i hope so!
i was flying to alaska and it was a nervewracking flight . 
was it a long flight? or was there lots of turbulance? 
it was about   hours .  a little bit of turbulance .  i just have nothing to do on flights . 
ah _comma_  i can t imagine being up in the air that long! sounds like it was a boring flight too .  
well the sights outside were pretty
i guess that is one positive! 
i studied all night and i still flunked my math test .  i can t believe it!
did you study hard?
yes _comma_  it just baffles me .  maybe next time i shouldn t even study . 
no _comma_  you should keep studying . 
i really wanted a certain job and i did not get it
that stinks _comma_  it s never worth giving up though! what line of work do you prefer?
video work .  it is very competitive . 
i can definitely believe that .  i hope something opens up for you soon!
it was so fun!
what was so fun?
taking my dog to the dog park!
oh yeah!!! i love taking my dog too _comma_  she gets to get all that dang energy out before i bring her back to our little apartment!
yeah _comma_  my golden retriever is really happy to meet people .  for some reason he doesn t care much for other dogs . 
i really miss my dog who passed away . 
that sucks _comma_  i love dogs . 
me too .  she is a better place now . 
yes i am sure she it . 
the other day i lost control of my car and got in a huge wreck .  my leg broke _comma_  but i knew i would walk again .

no _comma_  by the grace of god .  he protects me at all times . 
awesome .  i am so glad to hear that .  always good to hear the stories were someone gets away!!
i hate when i make plans and the rain cancels them . 
i agree with that! i just had the rain cancel my trip to the beach yesterday! makes me so mad . 
yeah _comma_  some people like the rain! i don t get how . 
i mean i like the rain at certain times .  but not when i m trying to do fun stuff outside!
at least it s the summer so being in the rain doesn t make you freezing cold! if you re in the northern hemisphere that is . 
i m planning to return to college for engineering which should be cool . 
that is such a brilliant idea _comma_  are you excited about it?
yeah _comma_  i have more years left . 
that s awesome _comma_  you ll thank yourself later down the road for making yourself do it!
i hope to get a cool job  _comma_   not sure what industry i want to be in  _comma_   maybe cars or airplanes . 
i caught somebody stealing a package from my front yard on surveillance . 
oh wow! i have heard of that happening to lots of people .  did they get arrested?
not yet .  people these days just don t care .  they steal anything they lay their eyes on!
yes they do .  it has gotten really bad around here with car thefts .  it s no wonder are car insurance rates are so high . 
i just got back from buying a few groceries at the store .  
oh really? what d ya get?
just stuff for dinner .  at the checkout _comma_  a guy took my receipt!
why did he do that?
i am not sure .  he was on his phone though . 
i studied really hard for my math test last week _comma_  so i knew i would ace it . 
math is a tough subject .  good for you . 
i know _comma_  i feel like i can solve math problems that even einstein couldn t solve . 
being good at math will open lots of opportunities for you .  keep at it . 
we have taken many unplanned trips this summer that i didn t have money for .  but i was able to pick up more work and pay for them . 
how exciting that you were able to do that .  i hope it was fun . 
it has been a fun summer! i am so tired though . 
it s funny how you need a vacation to recover from vacation . 
oh yes! i have so many pictures to go through though!
i had a major project and felt very ready to present it to everyone at the office
how d it go
it went well _comma_  i think i gained confidence by being so prepared
that s great .  do you present often?
i was walking home late at night and noticed i was being followed
oh no _comma_  what happened?
i ended up running back to my place
glad you are safe!
my girlfriend seems to be distant and talking to other guys

she fell out of love with me
sorry to hear that _comma_  i hope you find somebody else in your life .

yeah _comma_  it was pretty gross .  a lot of rotten food .

i did .  he is just a puppy _comma_  so hopefully he will grow out of it . 
i really miss my dog .  we had to put her down . 
that sucks .  what was his name?
barney .  he was such a good boy . 
barney was the name of my hamster . 
i was very anxious to start driving at    . 
i know that feeling .  it s nerve racking trying to incorporate everything you learned at the dmv in real time . 
it really is .  it s like i can t remember all the rules of the road . 
it s also scary thinking about getting in a car accident the whole time _comma_  that would definitely get me nervous . 
i cannot wait to see taylor swift in concert!
my wife _comma_  loves taylor swift .  
i actually went to high school with her .  i cannot believe she is as famous as she is . 
that is awesome _comma_  i went to high school with brett favre! small world . 
a female coworker came onto me at work the other day _comma_  but i refused her advances because i love my wife .

dang .  my old roommate was an engineering student .  he always told me how hard it was .  what kind of engineering?
i m doing mechanical _comma_  it s pretty hard but it s interesting .  a career in the field would be awesome!

i saw a colleague stealing money at work .  i wonder if i did the right thing by not telling my boss . 
is there a reason why you didn t tell your boss?
i just didn t want to be labeled as a snitch _comma_  but now i m having second thoughts . 
is there a way you could report it anonymously?
i hate when it rains _comma_  especially for several days at a time . 
oh i do too! i like a nice sunny day . 
how has the weather been where you are . 
it s been really rainy .  my power just went out awhile ago . 
oh no _comma_  does that happen a lot when it rains near you?
yes it makes me pretty upset to be honest . 
hopefully it doesn t rain this week but the forecast is at least   % all week!
i remember when we used to compete with yo yo s to see who could do the best tricks . 
my brother used to have a yo yo! he did a trick called  around the world  and also one called  the cradle .   know those?
yes _comma_  my favorite was called  walk the dog  . 
oh yeah! i remember that! i wasn t good at doing any of them .  i mostly just watched him .  good memories . 
last week we were at an amusement park and i cant believe my little brother got on the roller coaster with us .  he s usually afraid of heights . 
oh man i would have terrified i hate being up so high .  he sounds really brave!
i know _comma_  he usually never goes on dangerous rides . 
did he go on anymore after that?
my son got spaghetti all over himself at dinner at a restaurant one night . 
well he s young _comma_  so you can t really fault him . 
i didn t really care too much .  i had remembered to pack him an extra set of clothes though . 
that s good .  you seem like a great parent . 
i hate when it is storming it makes me so uncomfortable .  
does it happen often in your part of the country?
yes especially in the summer time storms are bad and hurricanes are at a high i hide under my covers lol . 
wow .   i can only imagine
i was using the toilet at walmart yesterday and somebody walked in on me . 
thats nuts . 
whats worse is that i was in the wrong restroom .  it was the girls restroom .  i just wanted to get out of there as fast as i could . 
did she scream?
i was finally going to get to see dolphins up close . 
did you get to? what happened?
i went to sea world for the very first time .  we got to feed the dolphins . 
i have never been there! sounds fun _comma_  but i don t support sea world and the way they treat their animals . 
last week there was a huge tarantula on my wall .  i thought it was going to jump on me . 
oh gosh! i would burn the whole house down .  i m terrified of spiders and bugs
omg me too! i hit it with a rolled up news paper and a bunch of baby spiders came out .  i had a panic attack and stomped on them . 
i would have a heart attack!
i will never forget the first time i felt old .  i saw a video of grandparents playing with grandchildren and i realized it had been awhile since i did those things . 
i know how you feel .  life is too short . 
yes _comma_  i try to remind myself that i still have a lot to offer . 
yes _comma_  you do! just keep living everyday like your last . 
yesterday we had a pool party .  my brother got drunk and did a back flip off the roof and landed in the pool . 
wow _comma_  i never did understand why people want to get drunk in the first place .  i sure hope he wasn t hurt . 
i wasn t mad at him .  i just never knew he was that athletic . 
it does sound like an amzing feat
i got on social media yesterday and saw that my friends went to a party _comma_  but they didn t invite me . 
ohh that s rough . did you talk to them about it
no _comma_  sometimes i feel like they just don t understand me . 
do they give you any kind of value . or do they just ignore you   put you down   % of the time?
awhile back i was taking a relative to get a heart cath .  the surgeon sent for me to enter the operating room . 
is your relative okay now?
oh yes _comma_  thank you for asking .  other family members just got a call and told them everything went ok .  kind of scary when i was sent for . 
it must ve have been .  glad they are okay now . 
i got teary eyed when i watched my little brother get his diploma at graduation . 
congratulations to him! you must be proud . 
i am  _comma_   every time he succeeds  _comma_   i succeed .  i love my big headed brother . 
he s very lucky to have you . 
i was supposed to drive a friend to work
oh yeah what happened? 
i forgot to pick him up as i overslept
omg is he upset? 
a friend needed help moving
so did you help him   her
yeah _comma_  he didn t know of anyone else to turn to for help so i gave him a hand
that s pretty nice of you
yesterday my friend bought the ferrari i always wanted .  i deserve it more than him . 
wow _comma_  thats a nice car
yes _comma_  i don t know how a clown like him ended up with one before i did . 
it happens sometimes i guess
i was thinking about my old neighborhood
memories .  what state? 
can t say _comma_  but i was mostly just thinking about the friends i had there growing up
i understand but memories are always nice .  
i needed to use my car to drive somewhere _comma_  but couldn t
what happened with your car then?
my car was hit while parked
ugh! that stinks! did you found out who did it?
i was at a journey concert with my son and he had to go to the bathroom while they were switching out performers .  
i would love that show
it was a very good show _comma_  but the people were so rude .  we had to squeeze through a crazy crowd and didn t make it to the bathroom in time . 
oh well _comma_  it happens
i am suffering from severe fever for the past two days i don t have any energy 
have you been to the doctor?
yes i had .  he prescribed medicine for curing 
you will be fine then
i will take care of my self .  thank you so much for your concern .  take care of you too . 
sometimes i m surprised my son is actually my son .  he currently has enough merit aid to pay for     of his college tuition!
well that is quite the accomplishment .  
it is certainly much better than i was ever able to do .   i think my scholarship was      and i had no merit aide .   he set his academic bar high .  i just told him to do his best . 
he sounds like he has a great head on his shoulder .  you must have taught him well . 
i now have a new boss _comma_  and today was my first day of a leadership meeting with him .   you never know how you will be received . 
oh man _comma_  that s so nerve wracking .  do you think you guys will be a good fit?
he spent some time laying out his beliefs and his expectations   _comma_    and i have to say   _comma_    i agreed with all but one of them .   that s pretty good .   he spent a lot of time watching the rest of us interact with each other   _comma_    so i think he is trying to feel us out without making judgments yet . 
then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to overreact .  i guess you could say you lucked out _comma_  but that may be me speaking too prematurely
my mother will be    in a few days .  my sister planned a surprise party knowing the day _comma_  hour and location would be very difficult for me to attend . 
i hope you make it .  thats a big birthday . 
it is day after tomorrow and i am still not certain i can work it out .  sometimes people are very inconsiderate . 
that not good .  maybe she will understand if you just can t make it . 
my cousin just called with the craziest story .  she and her family are locked inside a cemetery . 
wow .  that would be one of my worst fears .  how did they even manage to do that?
they had gone to a fair and decided to stop on their way home and walk around .  i guess her husband lost track of time .  the worst thing is they haven t eaten anything since about noon . 
wow! any way they can get out? did they call someone?
you hope your teens make the right choices  _comma_   but sometimes even the right choices feel wrong .   he is choosing to be away with friends and not at home much .   i believe this is healthy  _comma_   but i can help but want something different . 
i know it is hard to start letting go  _comma_   but it gets easier with time .   don t worry  _comma_   you are not alone . 
that s what my own mother says .   in fact    _comma_     she said my dad had a harder time than she did when i called and said    _comma_      hey    _comma_     i m staying the night at so and so s    _comma_     be back tomorrow .    i guess i will survive!  hopefully he will choose to spend time here as he hits his   s!
yeah _comma_  they always seem to come back!  you just have to love them from afar for  a while . 
i witness a great sight .  i saw a gas station attendant leave his post to pump gas for a lady who has a hard time getting around . 
that s really sweet .  we don t have gas station attendants here .  but that s nice that they re that helpful . 
the one i refer to is more like a cashier .  he is supposed to stay in a little shack and collect money and turn the pumps on .  the lady offered him a tip and he wouldn t take it . 
ohh  _comma_   that makes sense .  yeah  _comma_   then that s really nice of them! and really sweet of her to offer a tip .  i guess there s good in the world after all . 
i have been fortunate to live a good life but i found a lump in my neck .   most people would get it checked out immediately .   i waited .   i was scared to get the news . 
i would absolutely be scared too .  good news or bad _comma_  i would be a worried wreck beforehand .  have you gotten it checked out yet?
i finally went to an ent doctor in may .   they biopsied it  _comma_   and that was the most nerve wracking five days i have ever waited .   it was good news  _comma_   but still had to have removed . 
i m so glad to hear it was good news _comma_  though!
even when life is tough and seems very unfair i have done my best to care for my family . 
thats great of you .  life is very unfair but we can go at any minute _comma_  so cherish those you love!
it can be difficult .  but i learned early on retaliating helps nothing . 
it doesn t help us no .  but you must take care of yourself too  take some time for yourself when being a caregiver ok!
i am off work for a month in the summer  _comma_   but i today was my first day back  _comma_   and it felt great to be back on a routine!
coming back to work could be good after a break . 
a month is a great break to  get away from the daily grind  but believe me   _comma_    at the end of week one you think oh   _comma_    i have all the time in the world   _comma_    and you aren t as productive . 
i understand
i still can t believe i did that .  my power had been off and i didn t even realize it . 
that isn t good . 
i arrived at church just as everyone was leaving .  boy did i feel awkward
did anyone help you?
when i was pregnant _comma_  i thought so much about what my son would make me feel!
i wish i could feel that feeling  _comma_   (unfortunately  _comma_   i am a man) .  what did you end up naming your son?
i named him george _comma_  men can have feelings of their sons too .  hopefully one day you will as well . 
i am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well .  george is such a nice name . 
thank you! my husband was excited when i was pregnant _comma_  but i don t think he got it until he arrived . 
have you ever been hospitalized? it s not much fun .  i had a mini stroke and was stuck there for a few days . 
i have   but not for anything that severe .  are you suffering any side effects of the stroke?
i am   % me  the hardest part of the hospitalization was at the end of the day when my last visitor would go home .  i am not good at being alone . 
yup   i know that feeling .  and it s always so hard falling asleep in those uncomfortable beds with an iv in your arm . 
i have a full time job that doesn t pay anything . 
that really sucks man .  are you planning on looking for a new one?
i love my job _comma_  it involves my five year old kid and my eighty year old grandma . 
well  _comma_   as long as you re doing something you enjoy  _comma_   that s all that really matters . 
it does! i love being there with my family . 
i have a table that is somewhat unsteady _comma_  i put my computer on there because i have no where else to put it .  
have you figured out what s the problem?
i have not _comma_  it seems to do ok except when my son puts his foot on there even though i tell him repeatedly not to do that!
sounds like maybe one of the legs on the table is bent? 
it could be _comma_  i just hate when he doesn t listen!
my   year old daughter keeps picking up random words lately . 
yes? thats so cute _comma_  but you have to be carefull not to say bad words in fron of them
i know!  she said the f word!
omg  _comma_   well it is a bad thing but now you can be more polite in front of them  _comma_   and also when you are not with them!
i went to a concert last weekend and saved the tickets . 
are you keeping it as a souvenir?
i am _comma_  i plan to scrapbook it once i get the pictures back . 
nice _comma_  i do that sometimes with movie tickets if it s a great movie that i enjoed a lot . 
we recently went camping .   everyone definitely gets closer in such close quarters!
i ve been camping a few times   the proximity to others makes me feel stuffy too .  where do you usually go?
we went by a lake .   i accidentally opened the bathroom door with someone in it!
oh wow! i bet the person inside would ve pooped his pants _comma_  but there was probably none left!
this spring has really made me appreciate family . 
what happened?? did you guys went camping or something?
my grandmother fell ill _comma_  and passed away . 
ho _comma_  i am sorry to hear that . 
i got a notification on my phone that i had a package delivered and went to look for it
too late i already took it .  just kidding _comma_  did you find it?
i did _comma_  they left it sitting in the middle of the driveway so it could get run over!
oh _comma_  that s bad .  was there anything important in it?
it was some pills for my dog _comma_  luckily i found it before it got run over .  
my son and wife are coming for a visit .  been a long time since i have seen them
wao thats so cool you must so excited _comma_  how long has it been?
about a year .  i am on the east coast and they moved out west
wao it must be very difficult to be separated from your wife and son _comma_  sorry
i went to a hockey game with my five year old son earlier this year .  i had to bring lots of supplies!
oh yeah? do you have to do that every game?
when i have my son with us i do! my husband was shocked when he said he wanted his blanket and i pulled one out of my purse!
thats funny .  well at least it sounds like you are always prepared .  
i have been married for ten years .  since we aren t swingers _comma_  i m a one man kinda lady . 
that s cool .  i am not a swinger either . 
staying with the same guy day in and day out over a long period of time can be tough . 
how did you do it?
it s a commitment to stay with just one person . 
after a full year of trying to get a leak fixed   _comma_    i got help from a neighbor s roofer   _comma_    who  knew a guy .    he said the guy didn t work on roofs   _comma_    so i was confused!
that makes no sense . 
exactly!  the roofer told me that since i replaced my roof and the leak was still there   _comma_    the problem had to be my fireplace chimney .   he said stone chimneys often develop leaks .   as it turns out   _comma_    this chimney guy fabricates a type of gutter for chimneys to keep the water from running down the rock .   for      he made and installed the  gutter  on site   _comma_    and i have had no leaks!
that seems like a good price . 
its so hot here .  i ve had to shower like     times a day cause you start sweating anyway and it feels icky .  hows the temperature at your place?
right now it s freezing in my home lol i just got out of bed after    mins of sitting because it s coold
what? where the hell do you live? what do you mean its freezing? oh my god i am so jealous
haha i live in virginia where right now the temperture outside is muggy    degress just regular ac pumping in my home
ooooh you have an ac  _comma_   thats why .  i live in europe and ac s . arent a thing at all  _comma_   only the occasional pharmacy will have an ac
aw man that must suck how do you huys keep cool through the summer
we dont _comma_  icecream and cold drinks is literally it .  
oops .  i meant i was upset when my dog died . 
i m sorry _comma_  how long has it been?
happened in febuary . 
that s always a tragedy . 
yea she was    yaers old  _comma_   and had cataracts  _comma_   so i knew it would happen someday
last week _comma_  my girlfriend invited me to meet her parents .  the whole time i was on edge because i wanted to make a good impression . 
that s nerve wracking for sure .   how did it go?
well we had dinner and the whole time a was stuttering because her father was asking very personal questions _comma_  but i think they liked me . 
it probably went well _comma_  despite the common jokes most parents want their child to date someone good so try to look for the best in people . 
we love going on our annual family camping trip _comma_  and just got back from it!
oh nice! how long did you guys stay?
we went for a week _comma_  but did have to come back to town once . 
oh no _comma_  what happened?
nothing bad .   we actually purchased a house to pick up and move _comma_  and they drove it down the road the week that we were on vacation . 
i really love being in the great outdoors with my family!
oh yea? where are you guys? in the mountains? camping?
we went camping   _comma_    yes .   we re in the midwest   _comma_    so no mountains   _comma_    unfortunately .   but we were near a lake . 
lakes are awesome .  a body of water around here is pretty far .  how long are you guys staying?
we were out there for a week . 
i did well on a project for a company
did you get anything extra _comma_  like a bonus or a trip . 
i think i might get promoted based on the work
great .  what business is it?
i was on my way home when a car drove through a huge puddle near the sidewalk
i can tell where this is going . 
i got completely drenched _comma_  it was terrible
that has never happened to me .  thank god!
i am a stay at home mom .  school just started . 
well does that make you anxious?
it does _comma_  this is my only child and he is going to kindergarten . 
oh _comma_  that would be rough .  i ve been through that too . 
how did you make it through?
a close friend of mine has to leave the state for work
are you happy for him?
kind of _comma_  it s going to be sad since i won t see him again most likely
but if is a great opportunity for him _comma_  you should be happy . 
a friend was able to fix a problem i was having
that s very nice of the friend .  what sort of problem was it?
computer problem .   it was something i couldn t figure out on my own
bah _comma_  those newfangled computers .  it s nice to have a tech saavy friend . 
my coworkers sometimes put more work on me than necessary . 
why do you think they do that?
they don t want to talk on the phone and can get away with it for a while . 
that s not fair and probably very frustrating for you .  you need to say something to them . 
i agree _comma_  i m actually up for a new position so if that happens they ll actually have to do work for a change . 
i moved to tornado alley a few years ago .  i m not used to large tornadoes so i was pretty scared when it started storming . 
oh man _comma_  i can t even imagine .  i lived in kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage .  took out the power all day and stuff .  nature can be so devastating sometimes . 
we aren t too far south of kansas in oklahoma .  we have had to spend a few evenings in the storm shelter .  i guess stuff can be replaced .  
jeeeze  _comma_   yea  _comma_   it s totally understandable to be afraid .  has it been good there otherwise?
i love it here _comma_  except for the tornadoes and snakes .  
it s awesome to hear that! i guess no place can ever be perfect though .  here s hoping we both can live long  _comma_   happy  _comma_   and fulfilling lives!
i can t believe i spent   hours in the car just to arrive to surf and no waves to be seen .  
that must be so disappointing .  is there something else you can do to have fun?
kiteboard but i left half the gear at home .  the surf report said    foot waves and it s flat water .  not cool bro _comma_  not cool
sounds like you really like the water .  so what do you do now?
go to the surf bar i guess .  
in   days i leave for peru
wow! i ve never been anywhere near there . 
it s a surf trip .  they have monster waves .  i m nervous .  
i ve been to the ocean a few times but i ve never even seen a surfer .  we had a small boogie board . 
do you live inland? 
i live in tennessee
i ve been river surfing in tennessee .  you have some decent white water rivers that offer boating and also surfing . 
wow .  i must have a boring life then _comma_  because i have only seen tug boats and barges on the mississippi . 
every single morning one lady on my team comes into my office and cry s
oh no! how come?
you guess is as good as mine .  she s crazy .  today she was stressed .  mind you she is    lives at home and has no bills . 
oh well maybe she has a lot of problems internally .  you never know how someone s home life is like . 
she did mention this morning that her doctor said she needs meds or locked up .  
aw well it s likely bipolar  i know a phew .  they have a hard time even on meds .  
yesterday before work she got in a fist fight with her equally crazy mother before work over salted peanuts .  
i can t decide how to spend the      .  i found next to my car this morning .  
i would save some and maybe get something you need want?
don t really need anything but it was a great way to start the day . 
for sure! any extra money is always good!
i m thinking easy come easy go .  maybe do something fun this weekend i m normally to broke to do . 
i can t i went out with my ex s best friend while we were dating .  i was a jerk but it was karma biting her in the butt . 
had she done that to you before?
right before that i found out she was seeing other people while i was in iraq . 
what a shame! 
yea _comma_  it worked out for the best .  a few months after that i meet my wife and we have been together for    years now .  first baby is on the way in december .  
congratulations!
got on the scale this morning .  thanks to work stress i lost    pounds . 
oh man! i wish work stress would make me lose weight lol .  i gain! are you looking for a new job?
yes _comma_  that or a new boss .  i love my job but my boss is terrible . 
oh i don t deal with that well .  i hope you get a new boss!
i give it to the end of the year .  by that time i ll be slim thanks to all the weight i ll loose and then look for a new job .  
i can see the kid s car from here .  he is    and has a car work    k
wow _comma_  what brand
bmw   series .  it s my neighbors kid .  
that is a nice car
yea .  i was his age in      .  i drove a    year old rust bucket .  
do you see a man and that yea he s got it going on?
yeah all the time .  i get so jealous
yea well i lost    pounds and now i m that guy .  happy in my skin .  
wow _comma_  that is hard to do .  congratulations my dude!
thanks .  it was rough i love desert but no desert food for   months .  
last time i climbed elbert i started getting sick from altitude .  heading to colorado next week to try to climb it again .  
that sounds awesome!  is elbert a fourteener?
yes _comma_  it s the tallest in colorado .  this will be my  rd time climbing it .  but the first time since i got old and lazy .  
hahaha .   well  _comma_   i hope you don t get sick .   take something salty with you  _comma_   maybe that will help .   have fun!
last time i arrived and tried to climb it the same day .  my head felt like it was going to explode . 
aced my real estate exam today .  now i m licensed in two states . 
congratulations .  i bet you re happy!
yea _comma_  time to advance my career now . 
do you work for a company or on your own?
i m self employed but new to the business . 
cool beans
i was recently waiting to hear from my old apartment about my security deposit refund .  i needed the money to pay my new pet deposit _comma_  and wasn t sure if i d get enough money back . 
were you able to get it back?
i was _comma_  and i ended up getting enough to pay the deposit and then some . 
that s great! i bet that was a relief . 
i was watching a video about a man who made a small table out of chocolate .  it looked real and was just amazing .  
wow _comma_  that should have been amazing
it really was .  it also made me want to eat chocolate .  
me too _comma_  i love chocolate
i was so happy to watch my friend do a backflip
i ve always been too scared to do a backflip .  i always worry i m going to break my neck or something .  did it take him a long time to get it right?and did he get hurt?
i think he just took gymnastics classes .  he luckily did not get hurt!
oh _comma_  that makes sense .  and i m glad to hear that .  i always worry about that sort of thing .  you ever think about trying to do it netx?
i hope the next doctor s appt .  that i have goes well .  sometimes they aren t the greatest experience .  
are you sick?
yeah  _comma_   i have health problems  _comma_   it s complicated .  
that sucks _comma_  i will pray for you . 
thank you _comma_  i appreciate you being kind .  
i can t believe i walked in on someone using the restroom .  
oh my _comma_  that must ve been an embarrassing situation!
it was! i knocked first and no one answered _comma_  so i thought it was okay to go in .  
that s ok _comma_  you did the right thing .  it probably happens to lots of people . 
thanks _comma_  i m sure it does haha
so remember i told you _comma_  that i ve lost my phone for a moment on a subway?
yes _comma_  what about it?
so i guess i just dropped it  _comma_   and a very old man  _comma_   picked it up and gave it back to me
that was nice of him . 
i woke up today to a bit of a strange sight . 
tell me all about it . 
well  _comma_   it was still dark and too early  _comma_   but i felt like i had enough sleep . 
i try to always go for extra sleep . 
the party that was thrown for me was for my   th .  i think it made friends and family just as happy as it made me . 
wow!   th is a big milestone birthday! i can imagine that everyone was excited to get to share that with you . 
thank you! i was glad to share that moment with them . 
did you feel old after?
haha _comma_  not really .  i feel older now .  
i was frustrated because i could not print a document _comma_  and a co worker showed me a keyboard shortcut to find it everytime . 
that had to be relief .  so now you won t have to deal with that frustration again . 
yes indeed _comma_  it was frustrating!  i didn t have time to mess with it everytime i had to print something . 
those keyboard shortcuts can be lifesavers . 
yes they can .  i have become much more productive as a result . 
some things have changed in my life and my close friends have family have helped me through _comma_  which i really appreciate . 
thats good .  everyone isnt so fortunate . 
for sure _comma_  thank you .  times can change very unexpectedly .  
its goof to have support when it does change . 
definitely _comma_  i think we all need to support each other better in this world .  
exactly
hopefully we can find some kindness in the world and get the support we all need .  
we would all be better people then
one day i randomly got a raise _comma_  not something i was expecting!
oh wow .  bet it felt amazing .  was it a mistake?
thanks! it wasn t a mistake .  just unexpected and pretty neat!
sounds like a great day .  makes you wish it would happen everyday
i definitely wish that could happen!
i was at the store and accidentally knocked over some items .  i could feel my face turning red . 
that s so embarrassing! what did you do?
i picked them up and tried to move to another area!
did anyone say anything?
i don t think so .  i seem to do these things quite often . 
well at least you got away with it this time!
haha  _comma_   i think as long as i put them back  _comma_   no one minds . 
i was flying alone  _comma_   even though i had before  _comma_   this particular time i felt wary . 
really? why was that?
i think i felt concerned that the plane would crash or that something else bad might happen .  
do you normally feel like that when you fly?
i do sometimes _comma_  but this time it was even more so . 
i was traveling on a plane by myself and i felt kind of scared . 
i can understand that _comma_  flying is scary . 
it is .  we ended up going through a thunderstorm . 
i m glad you didn t get hurt . 
thank you! there was a lot of turbulence _comma_  so that was not fun . 
hello!
hey _comma_  do you have anything on your mind?
yeah! i just received an email from guild wars   customer support   _comma_    i lost my game code so i couldnt recover my account (forgot password)   _comma_    and they sent an email back asking me for the code .  its so surprising having to deal with people this stupid   _comma_    you would think that they would never get hired to begin with
i agree _comma_  incompetent customer support is one of the worst things when dealing with such problems . 
its so surprising though   _comma_    they were hired to do one thing   _comma_    and then they fail at that one thing   _comma_    how did you get hired d: online stores have a similar problem with indians   i have nothing against them but the people online stores elect to hire are ones who cant speak english which results in your problem never getting solved cause they dont understand you .  
i recently lost my dog _comma_  after    years . 
oh i am so sorry for your loss . 
yeah _comma_  it was terrible .   heart wrenching to bury him . 
i bet .  you gave him a good long life _comma_  that was the best you could do . 
when a spot came open for a supervisor job at my employer _comma_  that was a stressful week for me . 
i am sorry it was so stressful
they had many qualified candidates and it took a full week for them to make their decision . 
just hope for the best
i had to work the day that my boyfriend and his family went to a christmas party . 
ugh thats the worst right .  everyone should have holidays off .  
it wasn t even a holiday _comma_  just on a saturday during the day because the drive was so long . 
i say skip work next time :p go for it 
when my daughter was a baby she couldn t talk so i taught her sign language . 
i just love that _comma_  my son knows asl
that s great! i taught her a few words that were interesting to her so she could tell us what she needed . 
i wish schools would teach kids asl 
yeah _comma_  me too that would be nice for them to learn . 
my sister in law planned a get together during a time we couldn t go . 
she wants to spend time with you
well no _comma_  she knew we couldn t go out late because of my son s bedtime and scheduled it anyway . 
that was nice of her
my mother in law wanted to take my daughter to colorado _comma_  but she is only   . 
its a beautiful place
i m sure it is _comma_  but she is very young and still looks for me in the morning . 
in that case i agree then
we were going on vacation and i made a list of everything we could possibly need when we were there . 
where are you going on vacation?
we went to new jersey  _comma_   so a long way for us .  we had a toddler  _comma_   so i had to make sure i had everything for her . 
that is close for me _comma_  but it is a fun time!
i seem to be always alert  _comma_   so that even something loud happens  _comma_   i remain calm . 
i admire that 
i just wander _comma_  is this normal?
no its not
i have been having bad anxiety for months .  i cante seem to get a to stop . 
i see _comma_  have you tried yoga and meditation? 
nope . but have been practicing breathing and muscle relaxation
keep a positive mindset and your anxieties will be relieved! 
i hope so . thank you for youre support . 
i was having my second baby and my friends threw me a baby shower without me knowing . 
oh my _comma_  you must have very surprised! 
yes _comma_  i was not expecting it at all .  they invited us over to hang out . 
it must have been an enjoyable day .  you have nice friends!
i couldn t sleep on christmas eve .  i was ready to see my daughter s face when she woke up in the morning . 
i bet she was so excited!! did she love her presents?
yeah she did _comma_  but i guess i was looking forward to it more than she was . 
that was me last christmas lol my son was only   months old but i bought so many presents and i was so excited to see his reaction
i really like my job .  i m worried that i will lose it . 
oh no .  why are you worried to lose it?
i don t have as much work to do as in the past and no one needs help with anything . 
oh no .  that is a bit scary .  i wish the best for you!
thanks! i hope more work will come soon .  are you doing well? 
i am _comma_  thank you for asking!
i ordered a pizza today _comma_  but it really wasn t a pleasant experience . 
oh no _comma_  why not?!
the guy that took my order was rude  _comma_   but i understand  _comma_   most people can t control themselves . 
they really can t .  it s still no excuse though . 
i can t believe my friend wouldn t answer her phone when i waited over an hour for her to pick me up!
oh that sucks . did she explain herself yet
no _comma_  she just completely blew me off .  i found out she was out on a date instead and didn t tell me . 
sounds like you need a new friend or your own car . or both lol
my neighbor is the worst! he has a dog that he just keeps chained up in the backyard _comma_  and he rarely feeds it .  last week i saw it and he looks anorexic . 
that s terrible .   someone should call animal control on them . 
i know _comma_  what kind of human being would do that to a poor dog! i m going to call animal control soon . 
i hope they do something to help that poor puppy . 
i was so shocked by the behavior of my friends dog
what happened ? 
when i knocked on the door i felt the door was open and i thought as he is in home itself i felt i can go in but suddenly his dog jumped on me
did he end up biting you?? 
no he but he pushed me with his legs and body he was so strong
my dog got really sick and was coughing up blood last week .  i didn t know what to do .  i had a panic attack . 
oh no _comma_  that s terrible!  are both you and your dog alright now?
yes _comma_  i took him to the vet and got him the help he needed .  the possibility of losing my best friend had me frightened!
yes _comma_  that would have frightened me too .   i m glad he s alright now . 
financially _comma_  things will turn around for my family soon!
i hope and wish so .  in this tough economic climate many are finding it difficult to cope with financial responsibilities
yes   _comma_    and we had a layoff of five months .   i believe in a brighter day   _comma_    though   _comma_    so i know it will improve . 
being optimistic will help you alleviate much of your accumulated stress
i was in a check out lane for a while waiting when another cashier comes alone and takes the people in the back of the line . 
that is literally the worst _comma_  the people should have atleast told you to go ahead  first! 
oh i know .  people just gladly go _comma_  but the cashiers should be taught to take the next person in line . 
its really so rude .  ugh im sorry 
i love hanging out with my dog in nature _comma_  it makes me feel good . 
i love dogs too what breed do you have ?
i have a   yr old golden do you have any?
i have a german shepard
awesome how old is he she?
where at i am in life   _comma_    currently   _comma_    is at peace with everything around me .  it is a first for me   _comma_    and it is simply amazing . 
that s awesome .   what did it take for you to get there
a lot of years struggling  _comma_   and finalizing realizing that the struggle is the normal part of it all .   acceptance and steadfastness led to happiness  _comma_   i guess . 
sounds like you ve gotten smarter and more observant over the years
i once saw a dead possum in my garbage it smelled terrible lol . 
oh how gross! i don t like possums anyways 
yeah me neither lol any wildlife where you live?
just lizards and gators .  i live in south florida haha
cool i lived there for   years _comma_  lizards were indeed everwhere . 
recently _comma_  i ve been watching my son play a game called fortnite .  it blows my mind how good he is at such a fast game . 
i have heard about that game .   i heard there was one guy that makes about      _comma_     a month playing it on the streaming service twitch .   maybe your son should give it a try . 
i have never heard of twitch .   that is a lot of money _comma_  i could retire!
twitch is just a place where people stream themselves playing video games .   i guess a lot of people really love watching good players .   go ahead and retire now and get him started!
my friend got a promotion and moved to california last week .  i always thought i would be the first one to get out of this dump . 
i m sorry your friend moved away .  sounds like me when i moved from indiana to florida .  my friend was upset when i left too . 
he doesn t deserve to live in luxury! he gets to chill on the beaches and i m stuck out here in the dessert . 
that is your friend _comma_  you should be happy for them! 
i m excited to go to school full time again in the fall!
aw i am happy for you! what do you go to school for?
engineering its tough but i think its really cool . 
that is great! good luck to you!
thanks _comma_  anything you re looking forward to in the near future?
watching my first child being born changed my life forever . 
i bet! i can t imagine what that must be like to see a bran new life . 
it changed my whole outlook on everything .   i have never felt such happiness condensed in such a short period of time 
that s awesome :) i m happy for you! hopefully one day i will get to see that
i stay home with my five year old son .  sometimes i hear things come out of his mouth that i know he learned from me . 
hopefully the things coming out of his mouth are good things _comma_  right?
i wish _comma_  he sometimes says curse words . 
oh .   i recommend correcting that before it gets out of hand .   good luck!
thanks! i was shocked that he picked up on that _comma_  my little playback machine!
i ve been watching movie a few hours ago _comma_  and still feel its effects . 
what movie were you watching?
i think it was called rampage .  
that is a great movie . 
i had a great time hiking with my family and dog recently! do you like nature?
i do .   it feels great to get out into nature doesn t it?
yeah i always enjoy hiking in the mountains or just going to the beach . 
the beach is my most favorite place to go . 
i lived in south florida for   years and the beach got old lol _comma_  but once i moved out i appreciated at a bit more . 
when i moved to texas i didn t know anyone but my boyfriend . 
that sounds rough _comma_  were you able to get accustomed to texas?
yeah _comma_  but i had left all my family behind .  i didn t know anyone here for quite some time . 
i know what you mean _comma_  that happened to me when i left for college a few years ago . 
we got a new girl in class yesterday and i bet my friends that i could get her number! let s just say lunch was on them . 
wow that is really confident on your end .  are you going to do anything with the girl
well that s the attitude you have when you look like brad pitt .  maybe take her out to the movies and try to get to second base . 
that sounds exciting .  just make sure she is okay with it all before!
we were talking to my husband s grandma and she asked about the rain hitting us .  i thought she was talking about the rain we got on the way to see her _comma_  but she wasn t . 
what was she referring to then?
she was talking about the rain storms that hit earlier in the week _comma_  and asked if we were effected by them .  
i see .   do you get a lot of storms in your location?
not too much  _comma_   but when she asked i said we did  _comma_   but we were talking about two different things . 
i always hate that when you are never on the right wavelength with someone during a conversation
yesterday we watched  the land before time  in class .  that movie brings back so many memories . 
that movie is a classic! i loved it as a kid!
yes _comma_  i remember we used to call one of my friends petrie because he looked exactly like him . 
hahah! that is awesome!
my new hotel neighbors are very noisy .  
get them reported
i might just do it _comma_  thank you . 
you are welcome _comma_  if you take your stand they will  behave
my son starts kindergarten next week _comma_  i am a stay at home mom .  i want to get caught up on scrapbooking my pictures of him!
i bet you re both excited and nervous about it! i have two kids of my own and one will be starting in about a year while the other is going to fourth grade . 
i had all these plans when i had my son _comma_  they didn t work out but i am wishing that this does!
i m sure it will! i hope it all works out for you . 
i hope so as well .  i am a few years behind . 
i recently discovered that there are plenty of like minded people around where i live . 
that s always a good thing .  it means you should get on great with your neighbors . 
yes _comma_  just knowing that i m not alone is such a great feeling . 
most of my neighbors are good  _comma_   kind people too  _comma_   so i know just what you mean . 
i felt anxious during my work .  the finance related work which gives me satisfaction
why did you feel anxious?
i love my job .  i eagerly awaited to achieve and go  as long as i want in my life .  
hmm .  i m a little confused .   why were you anxious?
i am a workaholic person i want to achieve some more thing in my life .  when i go to my work i feel active and energetic .  
we were eating ice cream last night and my son walked over to a police officer and started talking to him . 
well that s sweet .  how did the policeman react?
he was so nice _comma_  he even volunteered to set up a meeting with the mayor and my son!
oh wow! that s awesome! your son sounds like he has a bright future!
he was so excited! my husband and i were happy the police officer was so nice . 
my took me white water rafting with him last week .  when we got to the river i started having second thoughts . 
i ve done that before .  getting over that initial fear is really hard .  but it s fun once you do!
i know _comma_  but since it was my first time i didn t know how to act .  my mind started to go blank and i started to sweat profusely .  
i understand completely .  it s that initial anxiety .  it s a scary thing to do!
i couldn t wait for my mom to finally get here from new jersey .  she would stay about a week and a half . 
i bet you are pretty anxious and excited at the same time . 
yeah  _comma_   she would be able to see the kids  _comma_   and she hardly ever comes to visit . 
its always nice when grandmas come visit . 
last week _comma_  my brother landed a     on his skateboard like tony hawk at a skating competition . 
oh wow  _comma_   that sounds like it might be cool but i don t know what that looks like  _comma_   what is the    ?
it s when you turn a skateboard     degrees while spinning in the air .  it s very hard to do _comma_  so you can imagine the look on my face when i saw my brother do it . 
yea _comma_  how old is your brother?
we go camping a lot during the summer .  my favorite piece of equipment is my hammock!
i love camping _comma_  and understand why a hammock is your favorite .  they re so comfortable!
they are _comma_  i love to read a good book while hanging out in the hammock!
that sounds amazing _comma_  as long as you re not reading scary books about the woods!
i wouldn t do that! just a good book _comma_  where i didn t have to think much!
i agree .  camping and hammocks are for relaxing and letting the mind be free .  
i really enjoy going to disney because it makes me feel very nostalgic for my childhood .  
i ve actually never gone there .  what s it like?
it s pretty awesome! lots to do for adults as well .  i tend to go to epcot quite often with my annual pass .  we live right down the street .  
that s good to hear .  i do plan on taking my kids in the future!
absolutely do! memories of going to disney with my parents were some of my fondest .  
i was pretty shook up last year when hurricane irma came through florida . 
do you live in flordia? i have family down there and was really worried about them .  
yes  _comma_   i live in orlando so i was lucky that it was central  _comma_   but we were out of power for a few days .  
that was lucky .  losing power is bad _comma_  but at least that was it .  scary situation .  
i really feel good when my friends keep my secrets .  (or at least i think they do!)
what will happen if the secret is told?
not much _comma_  i just value my privacy .  do you have secrets that you tell your friends?
of course _comma_  i only tell them the best ones though!
my sister in law got upset when she was over and i was trying to talk to her about it . 
oh no _comma_  was she upset at you or about something else?
about something else and i wanted to talk to her and make her feel better . 
well that s really kind of you to help her like that .  she s lucky to have you!
i was at a concert a few weeks ago with my son and he had to go to the bathroom .   there were so many people there  _comma_   mostly adults  _comma_   and they refused to move so we could make it to the family bathroom . 
ugh _comma_  people can be so rude .  was he able to go to the bathroom?
he was not _comma_  there were just too many people standing around not moving . 
that s awful!! so what did you end up doing? did he just have to pop a squat?
he actually had an accident _comma_  because i didn t tell him to just go .  mommy of the year . 
i m really hopeful that i ll land a new promotion at work .  
as long as you work hard and stay dedicated _comma_  i m sure it will come!
i hope so! hard work and dedication tend to pay off .  
absolutely! and if you trust your boss _comma_  i m sure he will do the right thing . 
as we were driving on the highway we got caught in a big storm . 
thats scary .   did you have to pull over?
no we kept driving but the rain was real bad and trucks were swerving . 
i take it you made it out safe beacuse we re here chatting
my parents told me that we would be going on a cruise vacation at christmas .  i couldn t believe it!
that sounds like an awesome christmas present!  i ve actually thought about doing that with my girls now that they are older and not much they really need .   where are you going?
we went on the cruise in february .  it was a disney cruise in the bahamas! what a great experience . 
i ve always wanted to go on a disney cruise   it s probably my dream vacation .  i m so jealous!!!
i was so glad when i graduated college
that s such a great accomplishment and such a relief at the same time .  what was your major?
communications .  it was a little tough but not engineering tough!
i totally get that .  i majored in business but sometimes i wish i majored in engineering .  i m kind of glad i didn t though .  it s hard!
my family is so supportive .  they even flew out when my last dog passed away and spent some time with me to make me feel better .  
aww _comma_  that is very nice of them .  i just had to put mine down a few weeks ago . 
i m so sorry to hear that .  what kind of breed was your dog? 
border collie .  yours?
yorkshire terrier .  she was a sweetheart . 
i was very scared when flying for the first time
i can imagine! did you end up having a good flight?
i did .  luckily no turbulance!
that s good! hopefully you had a nice seatmate too!
my son starts school soon _comma_  we had a fun day out but when we got home he was really bad . 
aww _comma_  was he scared?
i don t think so _comma_  i think he was just over the day and it was too much for him . 
i can see that .  school is a challenging time for a kid . 
i have heard that .  just bummed me out for the day . 
i was very ready going into my test
always good to feel ready for something like that .  what subject was it in?
engingeering .  it was really tough!
man _comma_  i remember those days .  my engineering exams were killer .  did you do well on it?
anytime we take a trip _comma_  i normally save what some people consider trash . 
another man s trash is another man s treasure! what things do you save?
just different things that i can scrapbook _comma_  mementos from my trip .  
i keep a scrapbook myself! i love collecting stamps .  got any trips planned this year?
my pants feel down when riding my bike
i m so sorry that happened to you .  how did you handle this situation?
i just pulled them up .  it was just embarassing . 
i hope no one saw that _comma_  it must ve been terrible . 
i was scared to go to school
how are you going to learn! why are you afraid to go?
just nervous about all the people
it ain t so bad .  i m sure you ll make a few new friends and everything will be just fine . 
i was scared of going into the caves
please describe what scared you about the caves . 
just the darkness . 
that seems like a valid reason to be scared of going into the caves!
we live in a very high cost of living area but don t make a ton of money .  
is there anyway you can move to somewhere more affordable?
i m not sure _comma_  sometimes i wish i had what the other people around me had . 
i do too but it s natural to get envious of others sometimes _comma_  don t put yourself down over it . 
sometimes people ask me to do a lot of other stuff when i already have a lot on my plate . 
that must be so annoying .  i get that sometimes too . 
i feel like people don t care that i have stuff to do . 
i m sad to hear that _comma_  i m sure there is someone who cars . 
my son went to the best preschool .  when i needed him to stay late _comma_  they always had space for him .  
that s good to hear that you care for your son so much .  i am sure he will be quite an intelligent child going to the best of the best . 
i hope so _comma_  it really helps to get your village when you have kids . 
yeah _comma_  my village helped with my son s preschool tuition as well .  strength in numbers and good neighbors!
i was so grossed out when i saw someone vomit
oh yuck! where did that happen?
at fazolis .  it was so gross . 
during dinner? ack!
hello
can you tell me about your recent experience?
i couldnt believe it when i heard they are making even more new star wars movies
yeah _comma_  i love star wars .  i was sad when han solo died .  he was my favorite character!
i agree it was very sad .  i dont know what they will do with the new films
my husband went to go hang out with his guy friends leaving me all alone . 
that would make me sad _comma_  did you let him go? 
yeah _comma_  i mean i didn t want to tell him he couldn t .  i just don t like being by myself . 
i know how you feel  _comma_   i m sorry about that  _comma_   at least he probably came back pretty quickly . 
i felt upset when i forgot to ask my friend to dinner . 
i m sure they will understand .  you can always have another dinner _comma_  that s the beauty of life!
that is true .  good way to look at things!
where did you end up going?
tomorrow s my last day of work .  i can t believe it .  i wish i had something lined up .  
oh no _comma_  have you look at other options?
i have and tried negotiating with my old work .  i have an interview next week with another company so i hope that goes well!
i really hope you get it!
i was so mad when some guy cut me off in traffic!
oh no .  did you flip him off?
no  _comma_   i remained calm  _comma_   but i was very mad!
that was probably for the best anyway .  people who drive like that are the worst _comma_  though . 
i couldnt stand it when my neighbor was using power tools at   am on a saturday
wow  _comma_   that s super annoying! i understand wanting to get things done early  _comma_   but that s not very respectful to neighbors . 
nope  _comma_   it was very frustrating  _comma_   he lives next door too
have you talked to him about it?
yes i did _comma_  he hasnt done it since
i m pretty worried about what the future will hold .  i lose my job tomorrow .  trying to keep my head up! 
are you getting laid off?
yes _comma_  unfortunately .  we are having a huge company layoff and being a remote employee didn t help my case .  
im sorry _comma_  i hope you re able to find an even better job immediately
i was really scared when hurricane irma came through florida last year .  it was a pretty horrible experience . 
do you live in florida?
i do  _comma_   in orlando .  i feel lucky to have had no damage to my home and been in a central location  _comma_   but the storm was awful and we had no power for   days . 
wow _comma_  that sounds terrifying .  you are very lucky to have made it out without any property damage though . 
i work online to make extra money for things my family wants . 
thats amazing _comma_  you must be a good person
it s nice to be able to pay for fun things that our budget doesn t allow us to normally do . 
how many kids do you have?
i felt bored being by myself all week
sometimes i like to not have other people asking things of me .  alone can be good . 
it was just boring because i had so much work to get done
well at least you didn t have a lot of people under foot to slow you down .  so i hope the sacrifice of being bored was worth it . 
my son s school starts next week and they just changed the first day of school!
i am so sorry to hear that!
my husband had to ask off for a different day without much notice!
that is the worst .  at least you and your husband got something worked out for your son s first day at school! 
i was looking through my cloud and found some pics of when i was little . 
 a walk down memory lane . 
yeah _comma_  it makes me miss being at home and around my family . 
oh i bet! it s always good to cherish those memories . 
i was watching my favorite tv show and my husband kept talking to me during it . 
oh that can be annoying _comma_  did you tell him anything?
i just gave him a look .  the thing is he says i do that instead of waiting til commercial _comma_  but then he goes and does it to me . 
hahah that s kinda funny .  maybe he just missed you!
i was glad my dad asked me to go on a mission trip with him . 
nice! where did you go?
belize .  he did doctor stuff .  i didn t do much .  but it was cool to see what they were up to . 
oh  _comma_   that is really cool! what a great experience  _comma_   and fun to bond with your dad!
i was upset sitting in traffic yesterday
was it long?
about an hour
that s long _comma_  i understand the reason behind you being upset 
my friends were finally coming over to visit _comma_  it had been a long time since i saw them last . 
i know how you feel _comma_  it s always good to bond with your buddies when you can

i don t want to use note cards as i look better without them .  i did use them while practicing though . 
i hope you do well .  is it for school?

well congratulation on your a in advance lol
thanks i know ill get it lol . 
a tarantula bit me in my living room the other day and i thought i was going to die . 
oh my gosh! was it a wild tarantula or a pet?
it was a wild tarantula .  i had my family rush me to the hospital _comma_  but i ended up being just fine .  it only caused me discomfort for a couple of days . 
thank goodness! the biggest type of spider we have here if a wolf spider .  they don t really bite you unless you irritate them . 
last week _comma_  my childhood friend came to visit from out of town .  i couldn t stop smiling when we hung out . 
oh awesome! how are they doing?
great .  we were just cracking jokes the whole time .  it was good to see him . 
awesome! it s nice to see people who knew you so long ago .  no friendships like those!
yesterday _comma_  my brother came out on the news because he was taking about the new charity he started .  i m glad i have brother with such a good heart . 
wow _comma_  that s really great .  what charity did he donate to?
no _comma_  he s starting his own .  i m glad i m able to call him my bro .

i was in a long line at the supermarket the other day .  then some lady just cut right in front of me like nothing . 
some people have no concept of being rude . 
it mad me sick! do they teach these people about manners?
no _comma_  they dont . 
i was diagnosed with stage four cancer yesterday .  the doctor told me i have less than a month to live . 
are you serious? that is extremely terrible news to hear .  :( 
yes _comma_  i fell to my knees when i heard the news and haven t stopped crying since .  my life is pretty much over!
i really wish i knew what to say _comma_  but even watching my mother go thru stage   i still dont know what to say! spend a lot of time with your loved ones! 
when my daughter was a baby she picked up sign language really well . 
really _comma_  isn t that unusual?
not really _comma_  i was trying to teach her so she could communicate with us and tell us what she wanted . 
i m glad it worked out so well for you all  . 
yesterday _comma_  i was at the doctors office all day waiting for my blood tests .  i was hoping everything would turn out alright . 
i know how stressful that can be .  i hope everything turned out alright . 
the wait turned out to be worth it because the results showed that everthing was fine . 
that is great news!
i was so annoyed earlier   went back to get my car after doing my shopping and someone had hit it and driven off!
that wasn t nice .  i hope they caught them . 
no unfortunately not .   there were no cameras in the carpark and no one saw anything .   so i am left with the bill .   i hope karma gets them eventually though . 
that sucks _comma_  how much is it?
not sure yet _comma_  i have left it into garage to get priced up but its looks pretty bad .  
i was applying for a manager position at the store i worked at .  i felt really sure about the interview . 
i can relate .  you just have to be yourself .   do you know if you got the job?
yeah they offered me the job .  i was very excited . 
that’s great!  how do you like it?
i am really happy about the weather today
is it sunny where you are ?
yes and warm but not too hot
glad for you _comma_  it s cloudy and humid here . 
that is unfortunate
my friends girlfriend kissed me at a party last week .  it s been weighing heavy on my mind .  should i tell him?
why did you wait a week? tell her to tell him
but _comma_  he s been my best friend since childhood .  i think i should be the one to tell him .  i just feel so bad .  that s why i postponed it . 
i don t know .  you should have told hime when it happended .  just do it and get uit out of the way so you both can move past it . 
i got a letter from my grandmother in the mail today
that s nice .  i always like getting letters . 
did you ever have a pen pal when you were a child?
no _comma_  i never did .  it might have been nice . 
my friend won    million when he hit the jackpot the other day .  i don t understand _comma_  why cant good stuff like that happen to me?
   million .  that s unbelievable . 
i couldn t believe he won it because he s so stingy and i m such a kind hearted person .  i deserve it more!
well _comma_  you know how to get it from  him right?
yesterday _comma_  i went engagement ring shopping and i picked out the perfect ring for my wife .  
ah congratulations on the engagement! how long have you two been together?
thanks buddy .  we have been dating for   years on and off .  i can t wait to show her the ring .  i like it a lot and i think she will too . 
no problem .  i hope she ll love it as well . 
i was upset when my friend forgot to invite me to dinner
oh no .  did you guys talk about it?
we did .  he apologized _comma_  but i just hate that he forgot me . 
no one s perfect .  i hope you won t hold a grudge . 
i had a major work presentation to give
how d it go?
it went well _comma_  i felt like i had everything in order
being prepared pays off soemtimes . 
i took a work related placement test for a better position in my company
how did you do on it?
i did well overall _comma_  it was easier than i thought
good _comma_  well i hope you get the better position!
just started my budget .  apparently i m going to be ok .  
how strict is the budget?
down the last dollar .  i have a baby on the way so we ve got to bank money
ah  _comma_   that makes sense  _comma_   well i hope it goes well for you!
thank s im hopeful that we will be able to stick to it .  
i was impressed by my nephews performance at his little league baseball game
nice .  did his team finish first?
they won the game and he played really well
at his age _comma_  they progress very quickly
i really appreciated all the effort my friends put into my birthday
that s very nice of them! having caring friends is very important . 
yes it is
what did they do for you?
i m over the road trucker .  man it gets boring in the evenings .  
i bet it does _comma_  you should find a podcast you like
i listen to most of those as i drive .  i was thinking of getting into gaming .  i have a tv in the truck and can buy a game system .  
that is smart _comma_  i would recommend a nintendo switch!
someone told me that on the cb .  but i ve never heard of it before earlier today .  i ve got to do something .  the boredom is dragging me down . 
i see a lot of work coming up at my job
how so?
my supervisor warned me earlier in the week about it
i m sorry .  any way you can get out of it?
i was scared to fly for the first time
why s that?
because i am scared of heights . 
have you always been scared of heights?
i couldnt believe it rained this afternoon after such a sunny morning
yuck!  you didn t get wet and muddy i hope!
nope it only rained for a few minutes
that is good to hear .   no one likes soggy shoes!
i was really proud of my friend for doing a backflip
backflips are scary .  neck injury is serious . 
yes _comma_  but luckily he completed it without hurting anything . 
thats good! they do look cool too . 
i was scared to fly for the first time
i was scared the first and only time i flew also .  where were you flying to?
europe .  so a long flight!
oh wow! i bet that was really exciting .  i have never been out of the country . 
i feel bad for forgetting about my mom s birthday
you must feel horrible!  get her something extra nice and i am sure she will forgive you!
what should i get her?
get her flowers and a gift certificate to a nice massage place!
i was thinking about how i missed my grandma
i have the same feeling .  i miss her also
she passed last year .  she is in a better place . 
sorry to hear that
i have a work project coming up that needs to be completed
are you going to have it completed in time?  i hope you are not behind schedule!
i still have much to be done
ouch!  you better knuckle down and burn the midnight oil!
so i walked into work this morning .  i have a new boss .  he s    and had a phd .  i m amazed . 
wow! i would be amazed too!
a little worried .  while super smart as we get older we gain real world experience in dealing with people that you can not learn in a book .  but still at    i was struggling with my associates degree .  
that s so true .  im    and just now having the time to work on my bachelors .  but i have a lot of work experience . 
i m    and still working on the ba as well .  when life got in the way education had to take a back seat . 
same here .  well i hope he can adapt and do well .  good luck with your ba too!
so ever single day my boss is late to work .     minutes or more .  today i was   minute late _comma_  first time in   years and i got a wrote up . 
wow .  that s pretty hypocritical . 
yea _comma_  i even called and let them know the highway was closed down and i was going to be late .  i even text her photo of the traffic accident once i got up to it . 
i think she s just trying to cause a problem . 
i was hungry and took my co workers food
did you not have your own food?
i didn t have any that day _comma_  i was also out of money
oh no! that sounds horrible! did the co worker find out?
this morning i don t know what got into me but on the way to work i picked up a homeless guy .  
oh wow .  give me the details . 
yea  _comma_   as i pulled over i thought it was someone down on his luck .  nope  _comma_   he was crazy . 
are you missing an organs?
haha _comma_  it started off ok .  he was going to the train station .  i agreed to take him .  with in minutes he was talking to him self .  
well _comma_  at least you re in one piece .  you could have been in several . 
went on a first date last weekend .  had some sort of bbq appetizer early in the date .  yummy _comma_  yea well not really! 
not really? how come?
well  _comma_   after about an hour i got up to pee .  as i washed my hands i looked up and my face was covered with sauce .  it looked like someone poured it on my face  _comma_   
oh wow _comma_  the bbq must be delicious . 
yea _comma_  i will not see here again but i will be seeing the bbq again this weekend .  
do you ever wake up and realize how lucky we are? i travel a lot and i just got back from haiti .  i m convinced it s better to be poor in america then rich in haiti . 
that s a profound thought .  we definitely take america for granted _comma_  especially when some people say it s in its  worst state in a long time .   we re prisoners of the moment . 
those that criticize have not traveled the real world out side resort gates or into the third world .  then you see a real state that is in trouble . 
yeah    _comma_     i guess you would know for sure    _comma_     since you ve seen it first hand .  especially a place like haiti    _comma_     that s just gets pounded with hurricanes .  what brought you to haiti    _comma_     if you don t mind me asking?
i travel a lot .  my self and my wife try to see     new cultures a year .  
monday i was downtown for work .  i was on my way home when a homeless man asked form some money .  i went to reach for my wallet and it was gone . 
i am sorry to hear that . is there a chance you forgot your wallet home?
no it was stolen .  so when i went to reach for it .  the homeless man could tell something was wrong .  he actually paid for my train ticket home .  i end up seeing him again today .  took him out to lunch and gave him some money . 
that story could become a movie script . 
i really want to help him get his life together .  
all i want in life this weekend is to sleep and i have to work .  
that’s a bummer .  drink some coffee
coffee dose even phase me anymore .  the lack of sleep is making my soul sad . 
try drinking a lot of water and cutting out soda
i ll try that .  
this weekend was supposed to be my first weekend off in   months .  
is it not going to happen?
nope _comma_  my boss who only works one weekend a month has decided this month she is not going to work any weekends . 
that sucks .  
yea _comma_  she is not a very good boss and now i m super bummed .  
you should find another job .  no use being miserable .  or tell her boss!
i recently took my els certification test .  i studied really hard _comma_  so i m sure i passed it . 
what s els?
sorry _comma_  esl .  it s english as a second language .  it just means i am certified to teach students that don t speak fluent english . 
ah _comma_  gotcha .  a few of my friends teach english to chinese students online and i think they have taken esl courses
i just moved into my new house and i am having a cockroach problem . 
that really sucks! what do you have to do?
i m just using raid right now _comma_  but i will call an exterminator tomorrow .  i hate bugs so i am freaking out a little bit . 
i do too .   i am so sorry you are going through this
when i was in new york _comma_  i got to see stomp .  it was an amazing show . 
wow .  i had that dvd . 
i used to watch it in music class a lot .  i am fascinated by the way they make music with everyday items . 
i know .  i wonder if they still do that show
this was just a few years ago _comma_  so hopefully . 
i love my dad .  he only made me pay half of the money i owed him and let me keep the rest for my pet deposit . 
some dads are cool like that .  my mom is that way sometimes . 
i was shocked .  i was fully prepared to pay the full thing .  he s great . 
i just went on a trip with my mom and sh paid for almost everything
my bus broke down and i was late for work _comma_  again!
are you a busdriver?
no i ride a bus to work .  this has happened twice in the past month .  i need to get a car
ah _comma_  gotcha .  i hate it when things happen out of our control .  hope you get it figured out
hey there
hi what you got going on?
uhm .  just feeling blue .  my gf broke up with me recently and got married to an investment banker
that is really sad .   are you alright?
i guess so .  i mean  _comma_   we were the same age .  this guy was like     years elder  _comma_   so ahead of me in life .  i tried convincing her to give me a bit more time .  well . 
i feel so bad that i failed my last semester exam
i m sorry .   will you be able to pass this semester 
i am doing my best to pass
i m sure it will happen . 
i will be presenting my project to the company and am tensed about it
i am sure you will do well!
yes _comma_  i have prepared for two months now
i don t think you will need to worry then . 
my best friend had arranged for my birthday party  _comma_   but she did not attend  _comma_   i feel so bad
sorry to hear that .  why did they not attend?
he was at work 
hopefully your friend can make it up to you and hang out with you some time soon . 
my parents went on vacation and i am left aloe in the house
ha _comma_  hope you aren t too scarred about being all by yourself . 
i am scared _comma_  especially at night
watching too many horror movies i bet .  just put on some comedy special . 
man i am so glad i was able to climb out of poverty . 
that s quite an accomplishment .  you must have worked very hard . 
i was homeless for about a year .   it felt like every day i would just descened even further .   but i always held out hope that things would get better . 
that must have been a very hard time .  your persistence led you to this success because you never gave up that hope . 
well there was a little luck in there as well .   i certainly feel a little blssed by my current situation . 
i m so pleased with myself right now .   i saved up enough money to make all of my car payments at once next month . 
that s very good .  it takes a disciplined person to save money
heh _comma_  well i didn t exactly save money that mush .   i just hunkered down and started working harder and asked for more hours . 
you truely are determined to get that car _comma_  what brand is it?
it s a kia soul .   i hope to trade it in someday to cover the down payment on an electric car . 
i am confident i am going to pass my exam
i hope you pass your exam .  did you do good at your exam?
yes _comma_  i always read hard
good luck
man i had an absolute blast from the past last week . 
really? what happened? 
i found my old elementary school .   i hear it was going to be torn down next month _comma_  so i toured the inside . 
wow _comma_  cool! did they let you in? it s so cool you had that opportunity . 
yeah .   it was mostly abandoned anyway .   memeories filled my head anyway and i found myself in the past again . 
yeah i went to a used car lot yesterday to check out a car i saw on the internet .   not happy . 
ick .  i ve never heard of anyone having a really good experience with that . 
well i realzied that the owner had taken the pictures of the car from a large distance .   up close it was very disappointing . 
ah _comma_  i see .  the classic photo trick .  i understand why you would be upset about that .  that s definitly why it s so important to go see before you buy
well i know i won t be buying anything from that place!
hi
hi _comma_  tell me what s going on with you?
not going . hoe are u?
oh _comma_  i m well thank you . 
its ok ya
man i am so cheesed off today!
oh really? any reason why?
yeah i was buying something in electronics and this guy shows up out of nowhere and starts criticizing my purchase!
wow really? that s pretty rude and bad in general for an employee to be doing . 
that s the thing!  it wasn t an employee _comma_  it was another customer!
you ll never guess what i saw on the road today . 
do tell
i saw a bear crossing the road a mile from my job . 
that s neat! i ve only seen ducks and chickens .  a deer did bounce over my car once _comma_  though
yet it really shocked me .   but he just ran off _comma_  so not much excitement . 
man i was so stoked to check my bank account today
i guess it didn t turn out well?
no man it was great .   i finally got my first paycheck after my rasie!
oh .   sweet!  congrats!  what are you going to do with all that money??
well i was gonna buy a few video games _comma_  but i ll of course set some aside .   no need to go crazy . 
save it for spider man that comes out next month!  i can t wait for that
thinking about it!  but  i may not have to _comma_  as by then i ll get another paycheck at this pay grade!
and more to come hopefully!  don t forget to save for retirement and or emergency fund :d
hi
hello
how are you?
am doing well thanks and you?
fine ya . thank you
hi
hi
how are you?
fine .  but  _comma_   i think you re suppose to do the prompts  _comma_   so hope it doesn t cause you a rejection . 
not for the rejections
hi
what have your experiences been like?
so nice my experience . 
that s good to hear! hope that it continues that way . 
yes
i feel angry i have to pay with an interest
oh i hate that .  is it a high interest rate?
yes _comma_  it is exorbitant just to say
it s highway robbery .  well i can only hope you can pay it quickly to avoid as much of that as possible . 
one of my friends sent me a lot of money for my birthday right when i needed it a lot . 
you read
i do read a lot of articles . 
that s great  _comma_  sorry for the error and unrelated message previously sent :) but you do have great friend that are dependable
yes _comma_  he s one of my best friends and i really appreciated the help .   he s like a brother to me .   and it s okay about the error . 
there was one time when i was in grade school and the fire alarm went off when i was in the bathroom .   i had a hard time buttoning my pants up and had to walk out holding them together in front of my classmates . 
oh my god _comma_  that must have been so embarrasing! was there actually a fire?
nope _comma_  it turned out to be a fire drill .   everyone was laughing at me .   it wasn t one of my prouder moments . 
its okay _comma_  at least now you can look back at it as a funny moment . 
i am sitting here and guessing when will the wi fi stop working . 
oh no _comma_  i hate having connectivity problems! are you having bad weather?
yep its raining cats and dogs in here . 
oh _comma_  it has been raining here a lot too .  i will keep my fingers crossed that your wi fi keeps working!
is anyone here?
yes _comma_  i am here
yes _comma_  i had fully charged it and after like     rides it had  % left . 
oh no _comma_  i bet that was stressful .  what did you do?
well _comma_  i called the very last customer and made sure he only was traveling like     miles and that the system wouldn t die .  it worked out . 
recently i ve been enjoying being by myself . 
i like my alone time too .  what do you enjoy doing by yourself?
i just love people watch _comma_  if that s considered alone time . 
oh that s is fun .  it s a way to be alone with your thoughts _comma_  but still be around others .  i love to watch people! 
when i wake up and know that i am doing the things that i like _comma_  i feel great . 
yes i can related to that feeling
i don t think people realize iportance of that in their life . 
well _comma_  a great morning leads to a great day 
i watched a horror movie and i feel terrified and anxious all the time
which movie did you watch?
lost 
that is a very scary movie! how are you coping?
it was really hurtful
what was hurtful may i ask?
well    _comma_     they made me leave everything at my desk    _comma_     walked me downstairs    _comma_     turn in my badge    _comma_     and would mail my belonings . 
that sounds like very bad treatment _comma_  you should sue them
yah _comma_  i feel like it .  thanks for understanding . 
i feel very strange for not feeling any remorse about anything really . 
maybe you haven t done anything terribly wrong that anyone would feel remorseful about .  do you think that s it?
i think it might just be a stage in life . 
maybe .  it s none of my business but sometimes when people feel this way _comma_  they could be experiencing depression .  
is it terribleto always feel ok _comma_  and not wait for the bad times
i suppose it is . 
than i will go on feeling this way i guess _comma_  or do i have another option?
you always have options!
she was actually always blind sinding nice to my face and back stabbing the other . 
sounds like someone who is actually not a friend .  how long have you known her?
i have known her less than a year . 
i used to work with a girl like that .  she always talked bad about me but was nice to my face . 
yah _comma_  i can t stand when that happens .  just so wrong . 
do you ever feel that now you have finally grasped what life really is . 
i can t say that i really do .  it s always a mystery in my mind . 
or is the sign of overconfidence    _comma_     like they say    _comma_        there are two types of bikes    _comma_     those that were in an accident    _comma_     and those that will be?
i believe i see it more as that type .  no one can truly know . 
some markets have to be avoided _comma_  that is if you valued your sense of smell . 
i know what you mean .  wednesdays there s this market i like to go to _comma_  but lately it just has so much rotten food
yet there s still something about that imperfection _comma_  do you agree?
totally .  i still love to go have a look around
don t you think that the only one really capable of bringing you down _comma_  is you?
yes _comma_  it is partially true .  what is the problem?
there aren t any _comma_  i am just drawing a conclusion from past experience .  
i understand . 
sometime all it take is one rude person to ruin your day . 
that is very true .  did something bad happen to you?
nothing major _comma_  but i am still learning how to deal with such behavior and always open for an advice .  
generally just try to ignore it as best as you can .  i m good about just letting things roll off my back . 
when i went for shopping i parked my car at a no parking zone which i am not aware  _comma_  police approached the car and was about to tow it away
oh no! those can be difficult to spot sometimes . 
yes exactly  _comma_  but i also had my     month old    month old baby with me  . 
wow .  that must have been stressful .  i have babies _comma_  too .  did they understand?
ya after they had seen my    month old baby with me they felt they should not trouble me by towing away car  .  i felt very thankful to them
that is a relief .  sounds like you made it just in time . 
yes some people are very understanding and helpful
gosh ive been feeling so nervous for the past    hours  _comma_   its almost like an impending sense of doom  _comma_   to my knowledge theres nothing about to go wrong or blow up in my face but it feels like something is going badly
i get it .  sometimes i feel stressed out for no real reason myself . 
i ordered some semi expensive tablet yesterday so maybe its that but like   _comma_    i cant think of a logical reason why that would go wrong so im left wondering why i feel so nervous   _comma_    its really weird   _comma_    very hard to relax like this
well sometimes companies make mistakes .  i doubt it s anything you did . 
i ve been recently thinking about the things we don t appreciate . 
i think it s very common that we take things for granted .  
is there anything that can change that?
i think you can really think about all that you have _comma_  and show your thanks that you have these things .  
yah _comma_  was depressing . 
what was depressing?
well _comma_  just really did a lot of housework and felt we lost contact . 
oh _comma_  that sounds like a bummer .  do you think it will change?
yes _comma_  it got so much better the next few days . 
have you ever watched this show it was really quite good?
what is the name of the show?
it was called hero s
no _comma_  i ever did . 
it was actually quite good
i am currently waiting to receive my security deposit back from my old apartment . 
why hasnt it already been returned?
they said it takes up to    days _comma_  and it s only been a few weeks . 
if you live in america and they fail to return it in a timely manner _comma_  i hear you can go to small claims and get  x the amount awarded to you 
wow _comma_  that s good to know . 
yeah r legaladvice has a lot of posts like that so its something that stuck to me _comma_  pretty neat to know that landlords cant just scam you
i ordered a surface pro yesterday! its gonna be so cool to play around with when it arrives
that s cool .  i ve always been a mac kind of girl _comma_  but i would look into a surface is i was in the market for a new computer . 
i only ever wanted one cause they can do the same stuff a regular computer can but also touch screen so you can draw on it  _comma_   i always got discouraged drawing on paper cause id waste so much of it  _comma_   and then just stop
i get that .  i got a bamboo tablet a few years ago _comma_  but i feel like working directly on the screen would be even better . 
it was such a sweet moment . 
what was ?
spending time watching tv and sipping wine together . 
oh that does sound nice
do you like wine?
as the day was coming to an end _comma_  i was begging to believe that my solitude was perfect .   
well in some ways solitude is nice . 
yes if you take it in portions .  
true everything is nice in bits .  too much of anything does get tiring . 
but i needed to be responsible . 
be responsible about what?
well _comma_  about getting daily chorses done  work first   play later . 
i understand .  i have to get work around my house done today too _comma_  before i can go out . 
yes _comma_  it teaches us self pride . 
i got backed into last week by another car . 
oh no  _comma_   sorry to hear  _comma_   hope you are ok . 
i m fine  _comma_   but they left a nasty dent in the front of my car .  now i have to get it fixed  _comma_   which is a hassle . 
i agree .  hope the car will look good again . 
meh i kinda feel bad _comma_  i wish i had family members to talk to
sorry to hear that .  did you try to talk to a friend?
friends are cool but its not quite the same as a family member _comma_  a spouse would be but i dont have that either!
i understand
yah _comma_  two colored socks is crazy . 
i agree _comma_  where did you find them?
lol _comma_  mixed up in my drawer . 
oh i see _comma_  ha! i would have just worn them like that to be more fashionable!
yes _comma_  funny . 
when i was travelling alone in a car at night in ghat road suddenly some boulders fell on the road 
was it an accident?
no the boulders fell    meters infront of me  _comma_  luckily i was going slow and suddenly stopped
oh ! thank good ness! that was close
yes but i am so much worried for what happened that night
i ate so many macadamia nuts today _comma_  i don t know how to feel about it . 
do you especially enjoy macadamia nuts or just eating?
it the only nut that i can eat _comma_  that s why i can t help overeating . 
it must be difficult living with a nut allergy .  do you overeat on macadamia nuts regularly?
its sooooooo hot outside _comma_    c .  its borderline impossible to deal with
it s awful out there .  it s been in the     s here in tx
oh no   _comma_    texas is basically in a desert isnt it .  for me on top of heat i also get some   wasps a day flying into my apartament and looking around   _comma_    i just got one earlier and had to kill it to get rid of it .  very annoying   _comma_    apparently wasps love it though
that sucks! i hate wasps and most other bugs _comma_  so i feel your annoyance . 
spiders are really the worst _comma_  thankfully it looks like the heat was useful for something at least and killed them off
i start back at work in a couple of weeks . 
what job did you apply to?
i m a teacher _comma_  so i ve been off this summer .  i am looking forward to having   th graders again this year . 
somehow i suspect that theyre not looking forward to having you though :p (no offence) i cant remember anyone that enjoyed high school lol .  its a good job though! literally backbone of society
haha  _comma_   true .  i try to make it a little more enjoyable for them  _comma_   but i ve also been in their shoes . 
i always trust my family like my mom to give me good advice . 
yeah that s always comforting .   mom s are awesome
do you ever disagree with your mom?
not really .   we usually tend to think alike .   why do you ask?  
aww _comma_  i didn t really relate until i had children of my own
cool .   so you re the awesome mother here?
we both are . 
i was really pissed off when i found out my best friend slept with my girlfriend .  i was shaking all over!
i m sorry to hear that

:( did you stay friends with him?
hell no .  i could never look at him again
i had recently applied for graduate masters in very prestigious universities but initially i was worried whether i get admission or not
did you get admission? 
yeah i thought the competition was tough and i may not get admitted _comma_  but luckily i was admitted
that s great news _comma_  well done .  
yes i am totally relived of that stress now
:) 
i hate when i am tired . 
me too _comma_  especially when it s still the middle of the day . 
or in the case here _comma_  morning
oh yes _comma_  you re right .  i m in the same boat right now!
i just need six good hours of sleep
i ate   pizzas just earlier and i feel so good and relaxed now _comma_  almost tranquility
i think i am missing something _comma_  you said you feel more that ok after   pizzas???
yeah i know right   _comma_    a lot   _comma_    and i am pretty thin so i shouldnt feel ok   _comma_    but i totally do feel great  . 
it s definitely some kind of anomaly .  
i think you just dont appreciate how good pizza is
sometime ago i was really hungry and decided to treat myself to some well reviewed restaurant _comma_  well it was all i hoped for . 
what did you eat there? 
onion soup with croutons . 
ooooh onion soup sounds really good _comma_  onions do taste incredibly well if cooked well with the correct dish
i was extremely disgusted when a close friend of mine threw up on my baby .  he was really drunk at a party we were at
i would have flipped and never talked to him again .  i am so sorry my god what did you do? 
what else can i do? i washed my kid clean and got the hell out of there
idk beat him up  _comma_   lol .  throw a drink at him  _comma_   the sky is the limit! 
i just finished making my bulletin board at work .

i m happy with it .  hopefully my students like it too . 
if you put so much work into it _comma_  im sure they will
i was so angry when i found out that my girlfriend cheated on me .  dont know how i can forgive her
i am so sorry! i would have a hard time forgiving that betrayal of trust .  how long have you been together?
  years
wow .  i hope that you can work it out _comma_  but i would understand why you wouldn t want to . 
i really feel nostalgic around christmas
really? well _comma_  who doesnt!
true .  there is something about that holiday that makes us wanna be kids again
i actually feel like a kid even now during christmas
my dad gave me the greatest gift ever on my graduation
wow _comma_  what was it?
a brand new ford car _comma_  i was thrilled
woohoo! you are one lucky child!
i felt really good about my change to new york after getting a job
no way! i just moved from ny to fl .  you are going to love ny tho _comma_  its an awesome state .  congrats on the job! 
thank you so much .  i moved from idaho .  so this is very new to me _comma_  all this
oh yeah sounds like its super new to you especially if you are in the city .  i was in the middle of no where so pretty much felt like idaho where i lived in ny .  :p 
i felt heartbroken when my girlfriend moved away without telling me first
i would too why would she not tell you!? did yall break up? 
we had a fight _comma_  i never knew we were broken up though
that sounds like poor communication on her part maybe its better for you she moved .  :  
hi there it was a hard day when this incident occured . 
what incident was that ?
i was driving home and it started to rain
what happened then ?
my tire went out and was going to call fro help .  i didn t get a chance to call . 
my dad passed away around the time of christmas .  it always casts a shadow over my holidays
i know what you mean _comma_  it sucks when those  dates  linger over us even if we try not to think about them .  im so sorry to hear that! 
yeah .  i know it is time to get over it .  but certain memories are so haunting
its not time to get over it _comma_  you arent doing any wrong its okay to  feel  things .  i hope people around you give you a lot of love! 
i feel like my dog is my child time after another .  love him so much
i understand what you are saying _comma_  pets are always close to our hearts
very true _comma_  do you have any pets?
yeah _comma_  i have   german shepards
i was shaking when i was watching conjuring in the movies
is it a scary movie?
it is a terrifying movie .  havent you seen it yet?
no i never heard of it
yesterday i was so angry at my parents .  but i kept my mouth shut and came away .  i cant hurt them _comma_  i feel so faithful
yea thats probably the best choice to make
i always think all those hard times they had bringing me up
i can understand that
some guy threw up on the street last night right before me .  i was grossed out
yuck _comma_  that is terrible .  i would be grossed out too .  what did you do?
i got the hell out of there right away!
i m sure you did .  guess he couldn t make it to the trash can . 
i saw some pictures recently of when my family and i went on vacation when i was little . 
oh thats really sweet!
yeah _comma_  it made me sad to see it because they i live so far away now . 
oh no .  i hope you feel better
i love thinking about fond memories with my family
those are great aren 
do you have a large family?
sorry(those are great aren t they?) i do not but we always had sunday breakfast for many years .  those memories are to be cherished and repeated :)
my roommate recently moved out of my house so now it is just me and my dog .   my dog is really nice and doesn t really bark unless he sees a stranger coming up to the house .   lately he has been sitting at the top of the steps to the basement and growls barks .   however _comma_  there are no windows to the basement and he wouldnt be able to see into the basement .   i have no idea why he has been barking at that door lately . 
wow that is a lot to take in .   get a muzzle
i m not bothered by him barking .   as someone who watches a lot of scary movies it is more of a worry factor that someone is down there than anything . 
i can understand that
i got a job offer at another company that pays more _comma_  but i turned them down because i ve been with my current company for ten years . 
do you think it was the right decision?
definitely _comma_  my company always treat s me right .  they haven t gave me a reason to want to leave .  
that s great .  maybe you will get a raise too
i felt shy when i dropped my groceries in the parking lot
why is that
because there were soda cans rolling all around the parking lot and i was scrambling to pick them all up
oh i can understand that
the other day an intruder broke into my home .  i had to hide in the closet while i called the cops . 
that must have been terrifying
it was _comma_  the whole time i was shaking and breathing heavily . 
i don t know what i would have done
my dog lola won first place in the dog show .  that s my girl!
awesome! what kind of dog is lola?
she s a pekingese .  when they handed me the trophy i just couldn t stop smiling .  she s the best dog i could ask for . 
i don t think i would have been able to stop smiling either! that is so awesome!
i was happy this morning when i received an email from my grandma
that s nice _comma_  is she technologically savvy?
not really but she tries haha
well it s nice she s making the effort!
i love reading old letters from family members
i do too .  i have a box filled with them .  how old is your oldest?
i have some old ones from the korean war
wow!
i have everything ready for back to school supplies for my son to start school . 
that s good .  now you don t have to worry about it . 
that is true! i also have his outfit picked out for the first day of school . 
wow _comma_  your son is lucky to have a parent who is on top of things!
i bet my cousin that i could beat him at a game of basketball .  he s horrible at playing so i knew i could beat him . 
what did you bet?
i bet him       because that s how good i am .  i had no doubt in my mind i could win .  i ended up obliterating him and taking his shoes too . 
that would be awesome! did your cousin pay you?
i was sad to hear my mom is in the er again
oh no _comma_  i am sorry to hear that .  i hope she is okay . 
me too _comma_  she has heart problems unfortunately
i am so sorry .  i hope she is able to get some relief and rest . 
thank you i appreciate the kind words
my son said his first word the other day .  my little man is going to be smart just like his pop s . 
oh man! that must have been great to hear! what did he say?
he said poop .  when i heard it i jumped up with joy .  that s my boy!
that s so funny! that s one of those things you will definitely remember forever!
im envious of my friends who are at the park right now while im stuck inside
oh i can understand that! i would also like to be outside; it looks like such a beautiful day! at least it is almost the weekend!
thats true _comma_  i ll be outside in an hour or less!
that s great! are you going to join your friends at the park?
i was walking through a trail to get to my house last night and it was pitch black .  i was afraid a bear or something might get me lol
you should have taken a flashlight just in case .  
i was gonna use my phone but it died _comma_  so i just sprinted for like half an hour . 
hey at least you got a nice workout in!
yeah way to look at it positive lol .  there was a river nearby so at least it sounded kind of relaxing . 
that is true .  well i m glad you made it home safely .  maybe next time maybe go a little earlier before it gets so dark out . 
for sure _comma_  or at least charge my phone haha .  thx i m glad i didnt get mauled by a bear too
 i felt sick after eating too much ice cream last night
i had ice cream too! sorry you got sick
its my own fault i went past my limit lol
ha _comma_  at least it was good
i took my pup to the park last weekend and he had fun meeting other dogs and their owners!
thats always fun! does your pup do well with other dogs?
yeah he is a golden so he is happy no matter what lol .  he will go up to people and not leave until they pet him . 
mine does the same thing .  goldens are so adorable . 
absolutely! what kind of dog do you have?
he is just a mix breed .  we really don t even know . 
mixed breeds usually look really cool . 
so i was drunk coming back from a party and woke up to find i peed the bed lol .  first time in like    years . 
lol _comma_  it happens to us all
yea you cant help but feel like a stupid little kid or something _comma_  at least i did lol . 
haha true
got any crazy drinking stories?
i felt dumb when i lost my receipt
that sucks did you need to return something?
yes some printer ink
that stuff is pretty expensive .  maybe you can sell it on ebay or something . 
so i was on the bus back from a party and a drunk guy barfed on me at a stop lol .  most of it got on my jacket and he didnt even apologize . 
oh wow! i would have been so disgusted and outraged! what did you do?
well i didn t want to start a fight or anything _comma_  so i just took it off and held my nose the rest of the ride .  then i washed it like   times lol
that must have been a terrible experience .  i m not sure that i would be able to wear that jacket again . 
i wouldnt have but it was a pretty expensive northface i had for many years . 
i can t wait for college in the fall! i left   years ago and am back feeling more confident in my studying abilities . 
i hope you do really well
thanks anything youre looking forward to?

thank you! i sure hope so . 
so last weekend it poured rain all day and i chilled at my house by myself .  pretty boring . 
i do like the rain though
it is relaxing _comma_  the only thing is that you can t do anything outside really .  had some plans but they got canceled . 
i am sure you will have plans again
that s true _comma_  it s good to look forward to the future . 
yeah _comma_  i am sure it will be fine
yeah did you do anything exciting last weeked?
i saw a dude driving a porsche down the street of my city .  was definitely jealous lol
i would have been to .  i always wonder how people make the money necessary to buy vehicles like that . 
yeah i am thinking this guy must be a ceo or something .  if i had the money i would buy one for sure . 
same here .  i saw a ferrari at the supermarket the other day .  i was jealous _comma_  and i also thought about how i would be worried something would happen to it (if it were mine) . 
yeah i guess if something happened you are probably rich enough to just buy another lol . 
yesterday _comma_  i ate a whole pizza by myself!
i take you don t have issued with you weight . 
no _comma_  i just did it because nobody thought i could . 
ok  _comma_   then . if it was a   thing only  _comma_   no problem . 
this guy at school keeps following me around .  he followed me all day yesterday .  i think he want s to be my friend . 
is he acting creepy at all? 
it s getting to that point .  i wish he would just stop .  i have enough friends already . 
have you tried to talk to him at all and see what his deal is?
im proud of my dogs behaing around new visitors
that s good you have well behaved dogs _comma_  did you train them?

the other day i went on a airplane and had a panic attack the whole time .  i m not good with heights .

i had to cover my head with a blanket _comma_  and picture myself somewhere else .  that s how bad it was . 
i m sorry .  that sounds bad .  flying always makes me nervous but i usually make it ok . 
i don t have a lot of friends .

i hope so .  i am driving and i just get so scared .  
just relax more you got this and it was just a fender bender . 
i took my son out and did a bunch of nice stuff for him .   he was great until we got to naptime .

why s that?
it was over     degrees outside and i was low on antifreeze
did your car end up overheating?
a supervisor i didn t like got fired

i felt upset about losing my friend s blu ray i borrowed
did you replace it?
not yet im still looking for it

i was walking down the sidewalk at night and thought i saw someone following me

yeah _comma_  tried to get out of there
hopefully you made it out safely
my neighbors really look out for each other
that is good to hear .  what happened that made you think so?
they always holding hands and smiling

that s good to know!  you all have a lot to be thankful for!
i loaned my neighbor some money .  hopefully he pays it back today
i would hope so too or else the relationship would be awkward .

oh that s never a good situation .  it happens to the best of us though .  i need to clean my fridge
i put it off too long this time .  it was pretty stinky _comma_  my dogs thought i was nuts for throwing food away .  
i m sure they were thinking waste not _comma_  want not .  haha
i was reading through some old school papers

my friends went out to a party

i think if you keep it up you ll get the recognition you want soon . 
i was taking a stroll at night and saw a group of guys up ahead
was everything okay? what were they doing?
i ended up turning around _comma_  who knows what they were up to
true _comma_  you never know these days . 
i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet
is your phone waterproof?
my case was _comma_  as the phone still worked
you are so lucky! my phone would have been done . 
i ve been consistently working out the past few weeks
that s great! are you seeing results?
absolutely _comma_  i feel so much better too
i bought a spin bike but i haven t used it yet
i took some cookies my roommate left out in the open
maybe they were left for you . 
i think he meant to save them
he can t save them out in the open .  what kind were they?
a friend forgot his phone at the library
did he get it back? i hate it when that happens . 
i went back and grabbed it for him
you are a true friend indeed .  i bet he is very appreciative!
a friend of mine was having a hard time finding a job

yesterday was my day off and i spent the whole day in bed looking at the ceiling .  my friends and family didn t even call or check up on me . 
i am sorry you are feeling like this .   maybe you should reach out to someone
it s like they only call me when they need something .  the only friend i have is myself . 
i am sorry that you are going through this
the other day i got on a roller coaster for the first time _comma_  and i almost pooped my pants because we were so high up . 
oh wow  _comma_   now that s funny! i ve only been on one roller coaster and it was rather small  _comma_   but i loved it!
this roller coaster was one of the biggest in the world and i m not good with heights . 
oh wow! i d love to go on a much larger coaster than the one i road .  but it might be scarier than i imagine . 
i couldnt believe how good my nephew is at little league

she hasn t returned any of my calls .  i feel horrible . 
oh no! well  _comma_   honestly if she can t deal with one mistake  _comma_   then it s no good anyhow .  but maybe it was something else .  sometimes people just don t click . 
yesterday was my first time at a karaoke bar .  i started to get all tense when my friends kept telling my i should go on stage to perform . 
i feel you! i don t like to perform in front of people either .  did you decline?
no  _comma_   i ended up going through with it .  i was worried that they would boo me at first because my singing is horrible  _comma_   but i guess everyone was too drunk to care . 
oh you can be as bad as you want there _comma_  it just matters if you re having fun :)
i finally purchased the house of my dreams .  we barley finished moving in yesterday . 
wow    _comma_    i bet it was a long day of moving   _comma_    but i can imagine the joy you must feel inside you   _comma_    congratulations !!!!

wondering around an     year old city _comma_  i can t help myself but to enjoy it s architecture and atmosphere .  
where is that
i ve been there sometime age  _comma_   it s in ukraine  _comma_   kiev . 
oh id love to visit there one day when its a more stable area
i never thought i could love someone as much as my little baby girl . 
i know! it s almost an unexplainable feeling isn t it?
yes _comma_  it is so hard to describe honestly!
but it is also the best feeling ever! enjoy every moment!
thank you! it is hard at times tho when getting little sleep . 
best advice i ever got was that housework can wait and take naps whenever you cam when the baby sleeps!
man i can t believe i almost bought that thing!
what did you almost buy?
i saw this great used car in a print ad   _comma_    and went to the dealership   _comma_    but when i got there   _comma_    it was all ratty and crappy looking!
ah    _comma_     yea    _comma_     i ve had the once or twice .  when you buy used you have to go in with the mindset of haggle down    _comma_     find a decent one    _comma_     or leave
the guy used an old picture of the car to fool me!  what a jerk!
for some reason heavy rain at night brings up some good memories for me . 
i love heavy rain _comma_  it just really soothes me . 
yes _comma_  the sound that it makes when the windows are open . 
i know! also the thunder is so cool to listen to . 
i wasn t feeling right a few days ago _comma_  but i guess i m alright now . 
i did a research on a cancer vaccine  
well i meant my mood _comma_  not my health in general . 
oh sorry for the mix up
as i was people watching today i suddenly felt very happy . 
what happened to you?
that s a thing  _comma_   nothing really  _comma_   i guess i just relaxed for a bit . 
ok .  i hope you are now fine?
have you ever wish to switch places with your cat for a day or two?
never .  i hate cats personally
how about _comma_  dogs?
i ve come to hate them too unfortunately .  constant noise
after the earthquake  i visited the old capitol _comma_  and saw still intact temples .  
oh _comma_  that s so sad .  what earthquake?
it was a   .   i believe _comma_  but it happened like   years ago . 
oh _comma_  that s a big one .  i bet it caused a lot of damage
i watched a stray dog yesterday that had a lot of tick _comma_  i felt bad for her . 
aw that s so sad! did you help it?
i didn t  _comma_   i don t know why  _comma_   maybe because i hate ticks . 
i guess that s fair _comma_  but i probably would ve taken it to the vet . 
for some reason i never liked cloudy weather . 
me neither .  it s why i hate living in london
oh i don t know how you guys do it _comma_  you must have artificial sun at home?
nope .  we just remain miserable year round
i was listening to a guitar play the other day _comma_  and it made me cry a little . 
music can be so touching to the soul . 
yes _comma_  especially when you don t expect it to be . 
who was the artist of the song?
i had to get some incense few days ago _comma_  because my room smelled bad . 
i like incense .  did you find the cause of the bad odor?
yes _comma_  it some plumbing problems .  
oh well i hope you can fix it soon
i realized a while ago _comma_  that it is good if you are not afraid of fear . 
what made you realize that? you can t live in fear
yes  _comma_   but if you don t run away from it  _comma_   there wont be any fear . 
it s good to face your fears
i had some thought come into my mind _comma_  and they turned me red . 
oh was it a bad or naughty thought?
it was a crazy though actually _comma_  but thank god i didn t act on it . 
what was it? was it really that crazy?
we grew up fighting a lot with my sibling _comma_  but i still love them . 
i think that happen in a lot of families . 
yes  _comma_   you are right  _comma_   but we still need to forgive . 
i understand .  you were the only one getting hit?
i was really pissed off when my brother ran my new car into a tree last month
ooh my god he hurt himself
thankfully he did not .  the tree was uprooted and the car really got damaged as well . 
so bad i can imagine that loose he made to you
i was terrified when i watched the new conjuring movie!
how was it ?
it was really scary!
wow i can only imagine
i would like to believe our country would come together sooner or later
thats a good thought to have
yeah _comma_  i mean .  we are all the children of the same nation .  time to stop the fight . 
i totally agree with that
my granny walked in on me and my girlfriend the other day
oh nice
it was really awkward though .  i mean _comma_ what do you do at that moment!
wait til she leaves and continue
i often am gone from my home and family for days or even weeks at a time .   i work on remote locations _comma_  looking for oil and gas . 
sounds like an interesting job .   i m sure it s taxing on the family though . 
it is difficult feeling isolated .   i miss them a lot . 
in the end is the trade off worth it?
i don t really know   _comma_    to be honest .   it pays our bills   _comma_    and it is fun work   _comma_    but it is hard . 
i saw robert downey jr the other day .  such an awesome experience
i am so jealous .  he is one of my all time favorite actors .  
he is so charming and electrifying in person as well .  such a nice guy
were you star struck?
so get this _comma_  my friend once threw up on me after getting drunk
oh no .  what did you do?
i was grossed out! i rushed off there immediately
i would have done the same as well
my phone company was billing me for stuff i did not use
oh no .  i m sure you did not feel great when you found out
i was extremely irritated actually
i would be too .  hopefully that gets resolved soon
i felt really good about myself when i stepped in for my interview last week
that is exactly the way you are supposed to feel .  did you get the job?
yeah _comma_  i got it!
good for you! congrats buddy
i just got a new job at the local firm

i recently found out that my old long lost friend works at my new firm
thats really cool .  how did he react?
it is a girl actually _comma_  and she was really surprised as well . 
this is such an awesome coincidence buddy
i was so afraid when i was watching the new conjuring movie
oh yeah _comma_  i hear that it is really scary
it was .  and i went at night _comma_  alone .  was such a bad idea
oh no .  but it gave you such a memorable experience as well _comma_  right?
i was so angry when our mail service lost a job invitation for me
oh so sorry to hear that .  what did you do?
i lodged a compliant .  but a missed chance is missed itself
i hear you .  dont worry _comma_  things will be ok soon enough
a few weeks ago i got in my first real car accident . 
i am sorry to hear that .   you weren t hurt were you?
i m mostly okay .  just a little whiplash .  i ve never been in more than a fender bender before _comma_  so it was not a fun experience . 
were you at fault?
i always get a sense of pride watching my children
aww .  that is so sweet .  i bet every parent feel that way
true .  i feel like they are my parents who were born as my kids
oh no .  i feel sorry for you buddyt
i went to see the new conjuring movie in the theater .  it was such a terrifying experience
oh wow .  is it really as scary as the reviews say it is?
that and much more! especially if you choose to go and watch it alone at night
damn _comma_  sounds like such a stunning experience
i was so grossed out when a friend threw up on me
i can image _comma_  that s pretty disgusting .   what your friend sick or drunk?
he was drunk out of his mind on whiskey .  i told him to cut back many times .  of well . 
you can only do so much .   next time i d just let him drink on his own . 
good for you my friend
i was so grossed out when a friend of mine threw up on me
oh lord .  how did it happen?
we were at a party _comma_  he drank way too much and did it .

this will be my  th year .  i love it _comma_  but the beginning of the year is always pretty hectic . 
yeah i d imagine .   the months off for summer is nice though . 
i gave my credit card for a stranger to use once
why would you do that?
i felt sorry for the person _comma_  she looked trustworthy .  and she needed to pay for some medicines for a friend who had accident
so _comma_  why didn t you just pay for them your self?
i felt so lonely in my new apartment
sorry to hear that .  why were you alone?
i have just moved away from my family to a new city for work .  so .

well _comma_  not too bad .  i felt really nervous the other day though . 
oh no _comma_  what happened?
the cops pulled me over _comma_  i thought something was wrong
holy .  what did they want?
i wanted set all the ingredients at the cooking table before i cook last night
i see .  any specific reason for that?
i just like to be prepared and organized .  thats me . 
it is really good to have that level of discipline
i want the ingredients all on my table before i cook
same here .   it helps make cooking go smoother . 
there is something so nice about being prepared fully
agreed .   no sense wasting time while cooking by looking for odds and ends . 
i thought about my childhood when i went to a comic book store earlier
i bet you did .  felt nostalgic huh?
haha .  yeah .  so much childhood packed into a room
that is really innocent and sweet of you my friend
i felt like i am with my family again when i went to the beach couple days ago

i was so happy to see my high school friends at our reunion
that is really sweet my friend .  it is nice to see old friends
true! all those old memories started rushing in
aw _comma_  i am missing my high school now that you said it
i feel such envy when i see guys with sports cars
haha .  do you love sports cars that much?
oh yeah .  i collected pictures of all the sports cars out there as a child _comma_  growing up
such passion for cars .  wish you can buy one soon mate
a competing firm offered me a job for higher salary _comma_  if i cheated my firm .  but i respectfully declined
how much better did it pay?
 k .  but i am satisfied with my current firm
that is not too much _comma_  i think you made a good choice
i felt so lonely in miami when i moved there from my family
sorry to hear that my friend .  why did you move?
i got a new job in here _comma_  so . 
i see .  dont worry _comma_  you will own your new city soon enough
i felt so alone in my new city
i am sorry to hear that _comma_  why did you move there?
thanks _comma_  you too
i am sorry to hear that _comma_  why did you move there?
i felt so happy when i went to a comic book store the other day _comma_  felt like i was a child again
did you end up buying anything?
yeah _comma_  i bought quite a lot stuff
well is it close to where you live? that would be cool to go back often
i always make sure to self assure myself before i go for an interview
that is a good tactic actually _comma_  it boosts your confidence
yeah _comma_  and confidence is key in winning those right
very true .  we should believe in ourselves for others to do that
i was so terribly sad when my granny passed away . 
oh my god _comma_  sorry to hear that my friend .  were you guys close?

when i get married i want to be like you  _comma_  and take care of my loved one 
i gave a long _comma_  drawn out presentation at school the other day .  i found the task to be very daunting . 
that sounds tough .   how do you think you did?
horrible _comma_  my palms were sweaty the entire time .  i hate talking in front of large crowds . 
me  _comma_   too  i m sorrry you had to go through that .   at least it s over now  _comma_   right?
my friend got accepted into harvard university .  that s my dream school .  i don t understand how someone as dumb as him can get accepted there _comma_  and i m stuck at community college . 
maybe they know a friend who knows a friend . 
that s what i m thinking _comma_  it s not what you know it s who you know . 
yep  _comma_   that s the way of the world  _comma_   especially with universities to . 
i recently ordered earphones online but i receive duplicate product
a duplicate? like a fake?
yes i received a fake product  _comma_  the make of earphones is very well known brand 
that  sucks .   i d be very upset .       you have to be careful who you order from online .   some times if the price is too goot to be true its a fake product . 
yes that s true  _comma_  i regularly buy online but this is the first time i experienced this . 
i had the worst day ever yesterday .   i had just finished a long    _comma_     hard day at work    _comma_     i had driven the    minutes home    _comma_     was just driving into my street and realised that i had left my bag with phone    _comma_     purse and most importantly my house keys back in the office!
oh no that is so frustrating! what did you do?
well i wanted to cry and scream _comma_  i was so cross with myself but unfortunately as i live alone i just had to drive the    minutes back to the office to get them then another   mins back home .   where i swiftly had a little glass of wine to help lol . 
ah yes  _comma_   a glass of wine might help to make that feel better .  still  _comma_   what a pain .  lousy end to a lousy day .  
exactly  _comma_   so irritating .   but hey you live and learn  _comma_   i guarantee you i will never leave work again without double then triple checking that i have all my belongings with me!
i would be so lost without my phone _comma_  but i could make it through an evening .  the house keys though! 
i was shocked to see      .    included with the card . 
was it some fraudulent transaction posted on your account?
no not at all _comma_  she justed wanted to make sure i had a good birthday . 
so _comma_  it was your partner who used you card
one month back i went for a wildlife safari  _comma_  where i was attacked by a wild boar 
oh no! was anyone hurt?
ya i had bruises on my leg 
that s pretty scary .   did the boar survive the ordeal?
it attacked me and ran into the bushes  .  it was a very bad experience . 
are you willing to go on another safari?
no i am done with such trips . 
i m not surprised . 
my husbands brother was getting married .   i searched online and in every shop to find the perfect dress .   i finally found it _comma_  tried it on and loved it .   i couldnt buy it until the following week as i had to wait to payday so i left it over in the store .   the next day my sister in law called in .   she had been shopping and had also found the perfect dress .   she took it out of the bag to show me and i discovered it was the same dress!! couldnt believe it .   oh how i resented her at that moment . 
that s very intense .  i am sorry you had to experience that . 
oh if envy could kill   she would have been dead on the spot .   needless to say i got over it and found another dress but just at that moment on that day . 
that s good .  time heals all wounds and can be a powerful cure to pain and disdain . 
indeed .   i had to take a reality check .   afterall the day wasnt about me _comma_  it was about the bride and groom lol . 
i never can get myself to give away their baby items .  
you are telling me you are a hoarder?
lol no i just can t part with items that mean a lot to me like my kids baby things like first shirts ect . 
everyone is nostalgic one way or another . you are fine
i was walking down the street yesterday in my brand new summer dress .   i though i was gorgeous! suddenly a big gust of wind came and blew my dress up around my ears! where i succeeded in flashing my underwear to the entire street .   oh the embarrassment . 
oh my goodness! thats terrible .  did anyone see? my face would be bright red . 
oh my face was very red indeed and yes unfortunately i got a hugh cheer from a group of lads who witnessed it all .   i was so mortified i just ran home .   later though i chatted about it with my friends and was finally able to laugh about it . 
i m sure this will be one of those times where you cringe when you think back on it! i m sure you made those guy s days though
haha thats how i am trying to look at it .   trying to see the funny side .   i have learnt my lesson about that dress though .   i think i will just put it back in the wardrobe and leave it there!
i so get how you feel because i decided to watch insidious the other night on my own .   i scared the life out of myself afterwards because i thought i kept seeing shadows and hearing noises and had myself convinced someone or something was in the house with me!
that s crazy! i m glad there was nothing there . 
oh no just my vivid imagination lol .   i do love a good horror but usually i watch them with my husband .   i am clearly not as brave on my own!!
some horror movies are so great that they make you consider your own environment . 
you are right there .   nothing better than a good film in general but horrors can really evoke such reactions from them . 
i helped a doctor s assistant over a couple of months
that s great .  i bet it was wonderful experience . 
it was she wasn t really good ans i had no problem helping
that s cool .  taking that experience into the next phase will be pivotal . 
yes!! they didn t forget me at christmas 
my car had a small accident recently
i am sorry to hear that . did you get hurt . 
no it was a minor accident  _comma_  but car got damaged little
do you have full cover?
yes  _comma_  but when i went for claim insurance company terms made me feel helpless . 
i never did find out why there were so many police cars there today . 
where did this happen?! were there any other people with you?
in town _comma_  i had my kids with me to buy school supplies . 
did it happen while you were in the store? i hope that your kids did not see anything too disturbing . 
i found my old high school yearbooks that other day .  
oh that is pretty cool .  what did you think?
i think that i didn t appreciate not having to worry about adult stuff back then! 
yeah _comma_  we were blissfully unaware of the real world in those days .  it must have been nice to reminisce . 
it was .  it was also crazy to see the     s hairstyles .  so . much . hairspray . 
i am feel pretty mucky things have been pretty stable at home . 
that has got to feel good!  you must feel very happy and relaxed!
yes i am and thankful since i have   young kids at home _comma_  
cherish this time you have _comma_  because you never know when it could change!
i got a gift card to a restaurant i ve been wanting to try for a long time .  
what restaurant is it for? 
it s a local non chain greek restaurant .  it s fancy and supposed to be very good .  
sounds good .  i love mom n pop restaurants .  so much better than big popular restaurants . 
yes .  almost always better!
i went on a blind date last week .  honestly _comma_  i didn t know what to expect at first . 
that sounds really interesting .  were there any good matches?
it was alright _comma_  but it was hard to find common ground at first . 
well at least you are putting yourself out there .  a lot of people give up on finding love . 
i have a dentist appointment tomorrow .  i think i have a cavity . 
oh no _comma_  i hate cavities .  are you brushing your teeth everyday?
yes _comma_  but i think i m genetically hosed when it comes to teeth .  i really hate it .  
dang _comma_  that sucks .  i hope you can find a solution for that
my son scored a perfect      on the sats!!
wow _comma_  you must be proud! he might cure cancer next!
i am proud .  and he may eventually cure cancer _comma_  but i d settle right now for him cleaning his room!
geniuses don t do chores my friend . 
i went to my moms funeral yesterday _comma_  but surprisingly i wasn t sad at all .  i was at peace because she accomplished a lot during her time here on earth . 
i m so sorry to hear about your mom .  it s good that you re at peace with it _comma_  though .  
yeah _comma_  she s in a better place now . 
but a part of her is still here in you .  
my husband and sons left town for weekend .  
they left you all alone? i bet you feel lonely . 
yeah  _comma_   it was cool for a while  _comma_   but the house is way to quiet now
i know that feeling .  i like to keep the tv on to drown out the silence
so _comma_  i bought myself a box strawberry frosted pop tarts last week .  today i went to go have one for breakfast . gone! 
whoever ate it all is evil!!!
i need to interrogate everyone in this house .  i m so angry .  you don t mess with mom s pop tarts!
i know right .  i would be so furious!
my neighbor was having a party last night and wouldn t let me sleep .  i felt like going out there and giving him a piece of my mind!
i would do it! try to be calm about it at first and see how he responds . 
no _comma_  next time i might snap .  they never show any consideration for anybody on the block .  they do whatever they want . 
yeah _comma_  something should be done about it!
my friend wanted to go to lunch today .  i told her i was busy _comma_  but really i just didn t want to go . 
i ve done that before when i was just annoyed with them .  don t feel bad!
well  _comma_   i do feel a little guilty  _comma_   just sitting here on my couch watching tv
who cares! i always like to think of satisfying myself first before others!
so . the sewer line backed up into our house last week .  
oh no! that s a smelly situation to be in .  what did you end up doing to fix it?
it was truly disgusting .  we had to have a crew of plumbers come in and dig up our yard . 
what a pain! i bet that cost a fortune .  did they end up repairing all the portions of yard that they had to rip up?
my brother got out of prison yesterday! it felt so good to see him after such a long time . 
that must have been a great reunion! who was happier _comma_  him or you?
definitely me _comma_  i gave him a big bear hug when he walked out those gates . 
he was lucky to have you waiting there for him!
the transmission in my car died last week .  such an expensive repair
ugh _comma_  i hate when unexpected expenses arise . 
fortunately _comma_  my parents offered to loan me the money to fix it .  
well _comma_  that was nice of them .  i hope you take them out to dinner after you pay them back . 
my friend and i both did a low carb diet last month .  she lost   pounds .  i gained  ! 
wow _comma_  great for her! i am confused as to how you ended up gaining though!
i dunno .  water weight? she looks so good now .  i m really envious .  
well _comma_  keep at it and you will get where you want to be .  it really just comes down to how many calories you take in vs .  how many calories you burn per day . 
on a whim today _comma_  i bought a scratch off card at     
please tell me you won a lot of money . 
not a lot        .  but that s      more than i had when i woke up this morning .  i was so surprised i did one of those annoying girly squeals at the check out counter
lol that s how i would of reacted too .  one hundred dollars can buy you a lot of stuff . 
my kids spilled juice on my brand new white carpet .  i told them not to brink food _comma_  or drinks in the living room .  when will they learn?
oh no! that s infuriating .  did the stain come out?
yes _comma_  but i had to spend extra money to get the carpet shampooed .  i gave them a spanking that they will never forget .  i m not putting up with this no more . 
hopefully they remember
i had a salad for lunch yesterday _comma_  then went shopping at the mall .  when i got home around  pm i discovered i had a huge piece of spinach between my front teeth!
did you brush it right out?
i did .  but dozen of people had already seen it .  i was mortified .  no one told me!
maybe you could give them a call on the phone and tell them about your feelings?
my friend invited me to a pool party _comma_  but i don t know how to swim .  i told her i would think about it . 
you could go to the party .  and then learn how to swim!
i m not sure _comma_  i might just stay in the shallow part of the pool . 
yea _comma_  and you can bring some water toys to play with!
i went to a wedding this weekend .  i ve recently lost a ton of weight so i bought a new dress for the occassion .  
awesome! i bet you felt proud at what you accomplished .  did you have this goal in mind for a while?
yes .  i ve wanted to be healthier _comma_  but i also wanted to look hot and feel confident at this event .  
how much total weight did you lose _comma_  and how long did it take?
i m leaving for vacation on wednesday!
thats awesome .   i wish i could go .   where are you going?
on a cruise to havana .  i m so excited!
cruises are awesome .   you get to eat as much food as you want .   you ll probably put on like    pounds
i got caught in a huge rainstorm last week .  it was a deludge .  
aww man _comma_  i hope you brought your raincoat . 
thankfully i had remembered to put an umbrella in my bag before i left the house .  
that s good _comma_  you don t want to get soaked and catch a cold . 
my brother in the army showed up at my football event yesterday .  i wasn t expecting him to come .  i thought he was still stationed in iraq . 
that s amazing .  you must have been so surprised and happy!
totally _comma_  i was in shock . 
did you get a video of it?
once  _comma_   at a waffle house near memphis  _comma_   i heard a man order    eggs over easy .  
gee _comma_  he must have been really hungry! that s a lot of eggs!
i stayed to watch to see if he d eat them all .  he did .  i was very impressed . 
wow .  that s unbelievable .  i wonder how his cholesterol is .  
tsa made me pull down my pants in front of everybody at the airport yesterday .  they thought i was a bomb threat . 
oh dang  _comma_   that really sucks .  i can t believe tsa would go that far  _comma_   it must ve been super embarrassing .  
yeah _comma_  i will never show my face there again . 
dude _comma_  you should definitely report it someone or the company because you could probably get something out of it . 
i rode the largest roller coaster i ve ever ridden this summer .  
oh yeah _comma_  what was it called? i really love roller coasters!
millenium force _comma_  in cedar point .  it was utterly terrifying .  
i saw that one on tv .  it looks absolutely nuts .  i hope to visit cedar point one day!
i m waiting to hear back from a few colleges about scholarships . 
oh _comma_  i hope you get some good news .  i am sure it would help you getting aid for college . 
yes _comma_  i think my stats are good .  i m hopeful there will be some good news soon . 
all you can do is be patient and see what happens .  i am sure everything will work out for you . 
my best friend is getting married next weekend .  i m in the wedding .  
that s awesome .  i hope it works out for your friend and their fiancee .  are you excited to be there?
super excited! these two have been together forever .  it s about time they made it legit!
well i am sure they appreciate you being a part of their big day .  enjoy the after party!
i went to a fancy art showing at a gallery last night . 
wow _comma_  that sounds fun .  what type of artwork did you see?
it was watercolors .  my neighbor was the artist .  i had no idea she did such great work .  she also has two toddlers .  i have no idea how she manages all of that . 
gee _comma_  she must have her hands full! i hope she does well as an artist!
i thought i could lift _comma_  but my wife upstaged me by benching     lbs at the gym the other day .  i can only lift     lbs . 
did you feel very emasculated by this?
no _comma_  it actually turned me on .  i didn t know she was that strong . 
yeah _comma_  i can see that viewpoint as well .  she may end up carrying you to bed next time!
my son came back from a camping trip last night .  i was great to have him safely home again .  
i m glad he returned home safe and sound .  did he have fun on the camping trip?
he did .  i m a worrier _comma_  but i need to learn to let go more .  
my mom was the same way .  it s all part of being a parent .  i hope to have kids soon too and i worry about stuff concerning them myself!
i came across my wedding albums the other day and showed them to my kids . 
oh wow _comma_  i bet the emotions of that came back to you . 
yes  _comma_   it was so much fun to see the younger version of me and my husband  _comma_   pre kids .  very sentimental . 
yes _comma_  those memories are what make life so special . 
i got a car for my birthday _comma_  but i kinda knew i was going to get it beforehand because i kept telling my wife i wanted it . 
so  _comma_   not a surprise  _comma_   but still nice to get? 
yeah  _comma_   kind of ruined the surprise  _comma_   but i can always count on my wife to make me feel special . 
that s sweet .  
i donated    _comma_     to the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals .  it s for a great cause that s very important to me . 
wow _comma_  thats very admirable of you .   people who abuse animals are the worst kind of people . 
i agree  _comma_   we should protect and nurture animals  _comma_   not abuse them .  
i have   dogs myself and i could never imagine hurting them .   i can t believe there are people out there who think that that is ok .  its sick . 
i miss my childhood and living with my parents
yeah those were the days .  when we had no worries in the world . 
yes indeed .   i wish i had my treehouse back that my dad built for me .   i would live in it . 
that sounds really cool .  i always wanted a treehouse but never had a good tree for it . 
i grew up in the country _comma_  it was a great place to grow up . 
i live next to a football field and every football season i hate living here
oh yeah _comma_  why is that?
because they park in my driveway!
i would have them towed!
i have signs up this year _comma_  so i can do that legally!
oh so you have to have a sign up to legally tow them?
yes .  which i think is wrong .   if they are on my property i should have the right without the sign . 
or you could just park behind them so that they would have to knock on your door before you let them out . 
my husband treated me to a week at disney _comma_  i had no idea!
that s awesome .  which disney park did you go to?
disney world .  it s the only one ive ever been to  . 
ooh i live pretty close to it .  you have a great husband to give you that treat!
oh my _comma_  you must be there every day then!
i am pretty happy right now _comma_  i don t think i have ever been happier with my life . 
that s good that you found happiness .  that s what were all in the pursuit of right?
exactly! i used to struggle but i don t anymore
you are blessed .  make sure to spread the positive energy .  
i do every chance i get _comma_  and thank you!
my daughter went out of town   _comma_    but she promised me she wouldn t do anything i wouldn t approve of   _comma_    and i believe her   _comma_    so i let her go . 
that s great that you can trust her .   how old?
yeah _comma_  she s a good kid and hasn t given me any reason to think otherwise .  she just turned    . 
that s great .  be thankful _comma_  some people aren t so lucky . 
man i can t believe i almost bought that thing at walmart!
what did you almost buy?
it was a combination rice cooker and vegetable steamer .   it looked so good in the ad  _comma_   but when i got there  _comma_   it looked cheap and shabby!
it s hard to find good quality at walmart
i hope i can find one that lives up to the promise of that ad .   maybe somwhere else _comma_  right?
i would try target .   good quality stuff there . 
i could try online _comma_  but i d have to buy it first and then see if it s good quality . 
try googling it _comma_  and read thru the reviews
i am trying to sell my house _comma_  i hope i can find a buyer
finding a buyer can be tough .   you have a good agent?
i hope i do .   we will see _comma_  i know it can take a while . \
does it have a good location?  you know the only rule of real estate   _comma_    right?  location   _comma_    location   _comma_    location . 
yes i live behind a school . 
sounds good .   definitely should target a family buyer then
yes _comma_  but i will leave that to the listing agent . 
you got a figure in mind for your house or are you letting the agent handle that as well?
i had to leave my last job because this manager they brought in was such an incompetent doofus . 
thats never good when you have a bad manager .   what made them so bad?
he was the  marketing manager  but couldn t market his way out of a paper bag _comma_  it was impossible to work with him .  plus he thought he knew everything which made it worse . 
know it alls are the worst .   hopefully you are in a better spot now _comma_  with a manager who cares . 
i am actually _comma_  thank you for caring!
i am concerned about my father
oh no! what s wrong with your dad?
he is old  _comma_   and he lives alone .   i just worry because he is getting old .   he gets on ok  _comma_   but i don t know how much longer . 
aw _comma_  i m so sorry to hear that .  it s not easy to watch our parents age .  
no it s not _comma_  but hopefully our kids will do the same for us some day . 
we can surely hope! 
my neighbor asked me to watch over his dog .  i told him he could trust me _comma_  but he escaped and ran away . 
that must have made you feel terrible .  were you able to find the dog?
i feel so bad .  i forgot to lock the gate .  no  _comma_   but i put up a lot of posters  _comma_   so hopefully i find him before my neighbor comes back . 
i sincerely hope you can find him! but i bet your neighbor will understand it was just a mistake and you didn t do it on purpose . 
i used to have this obnoxious neighbor who stayed up all night playing league of legends _comma_  he drove me nuts screaming into his headset all hours of the day and night . 
doesn t he understand that people have to go to work in the morning?
his parents paid his bills so no _comma_  he didn t understand that sadly .  i tried talking to him about it but clearly he didn t get the picture as he kept doing it . 
you might have to file a noise complaint with the police . 
i have a new job offer _comma_  but im not sure if i should take it
what is causing you to question whether it s the right thing for you or not?
well _comma_  it is retail .   ive done retail and it is not fun . 
yeah     _comma_      i ve done that as well .   it can definitely be a hard job     _comma_      considering dealing with the public     _comma_      hours during holiday seasons     _comma_      etc .  but sometimes if the pay is good     _comma_      it can outweigh some of the negatives . 
that s true .  i don t like dealing with people . 
so this one time i walked in on my cat using the toilet by himself .  he just taught himself to do it _comma_  i had no idea how or why but it was pretty cool . 
lol that remind me of a movie i saw with robert deniro  _comma_  thats absolutly bizzare by the way but cool at the same time
i know which movie you re talking about! i think they actually had to train that cat to do it .  mine just .  learned . 
wow  _comma_  i would love to have a cat like yours 
i went to a concert by myself because all my friends were too busy doing other things . 
aww thats too bad that no one else could go .   what concert was it?
it was a marilyn manson concert .  i was even dancing by myself . 
haha that must have been a crazy concert! 
this friend of mine is constantly job hopping  _comma_   i don t even know what she does technically but she seems to get good jobs so easily  _comma_   whereas when i left my last job i could barely get interviews . 
sometimes that depends on the industry .  if she works in ones that have high turnover it s not a big of a deal as  _comma_   say  _comma_   an administrative job
she s in banking so there are definitely a lot of available jobs .  and there seems to be a lot of turnover so you re probably right . 
well _comma_  i m not entirely sure about the banking side but i wonder what she s looking for .  perhaps a small vs big bank culture
i am ready to start renovating the rest of my house . 
ooo i love doing that _comma_  but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it .   what room are you going to be working on?
i finished my kitchen _comma_  so the next room is going to be my family room .   just painting it really .  
still _comma_  a new color can definitely brighten up a space and make it feel all new!
oh yes _comma_  we haven t decided on the color yet . 
this morning i woke up and i was in such a good mood that i just started singing in the shower . 
that s awesome!  i wish i could wake up that way every morning .   did something specific make you feel that way?
i don t know _comma_  i think it was because i had a dream about marrying scarlett johansson . 
ha!!  well i ve woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream   i guess it can go the other way too!
i went through my closet the other day and found all these old writings and drawings i did when i was in elementary school .  it was fun remembering being that little _comma_  how different the world was . 
i ve done that before .  i enjoyed it too! i love looking back at old pictures and stuff
did your parents save a lot of your school work like mine did? i m surprised how much my mom kept!
some of it but my grandma did save a lot .   i plan on doing that with my kids
for my birthday last year _comma_  a coworker gave me cheese .  it sounds ridiculous but i was touched by her thoughtfulness .  i love cheese!
i love cheese too! what kind of cheese was it?
smoked gouda _comma_  one of my favorites! i ate it all in a day haha
gouda is great! do you like prosciutto too?
yes .  basically anything meat and cheese and i am totally there!
my cat had really bad breath so i took her in to the dentist .  it turned out almost all of her teeth needed to be pulled _comma_  poor thing was in so much pain . 
aww poor baby _comma_  hopefully shes doing fine now . 
she s doing great _comma_  thanks! it was a tough recovery for a few days but then you could tell she felt so much better . 
that s great to hear .  you have one tough cat . 
when i was a kid  _comma_   i remember telling my mom to take me to mcdonald s  _comma_   just so i could get the toy in my happy meal .  i didn t even care about the food . 
ha _comma_  i used to do that too .  but i was almost always disappointed by the toy once i actually got it . 
right? but when you collected them all there was no greater feeling . 
true! mcdonald s was my first job when i was    and i remember being stoked i could now collect all the toys even if i didn t play with them!
i m so nervous .  i had a job interview the other day and haven t heard back yet . 
did they tell you when you may hear back from them?
they said within the week _comma_  i know it s only been a few days but i m excited about the opportunity!
i pray they get in touch with you soon and that s is an affirmative on the job!  i know  how nerve wracking waiting can be though   i hope you get it!
unfortunately _comma_  i accidentally sent an email to a coworker essentially complaining about her attitude .  i really wanted to dig myself in a hole and never come out . 
arghhhhhhhhh! i soooo feel for you and have been there .  have y all had the chance to talk about it? (or do you even want to?)
i ve kind of avoided her a bit .  i m trying to come up with an apology that feels heartfelt .  it s a horrible feeling!
i hear you .  maybe humor might help? like  okay  _comma_   so  this  is awkward . can we talk about that email?  heartfelt apologies go a long way  _comma_   and even if she doesn t respond    you ll feel better for trying . 
i went to a restaurant and the waitress put things on our bill that i did not order .  
are you sure they didnt bring the wrong bill?
it had everything we ordered plus a couple things at the bottom we didn t order . 
i would have complained . 
oh  _comma_   i did  _comma_   she immediately said ok i ll take it off like it happened all the time .  made me think it was done on purpose just to see if i  wouldn t notice . 
since most of my family is either dead or lives a few states away _comma_  i usually spend thanksgiving alone .  it sucks sometimes . 
ohh _comma_  i feel sorry for you
oh don t feel bad _comma_  i live a lovely life and have many friends .  it s just that they usually go home to their own families that time of year . 
ohh _comma_  that s bad .  you can always skype your family!
i spent the entire other weekend cleaning my apartment .  it sucked at the time but it was so nice when i was done to just chill out and watch tv . 
yes   _comma_    i feel you .  cleaning sucks   _comma_    but after all that hard work   _comma_    the results are amazing!
right? it s so rewarding when you re finished and everything smells good .  i love that feeling . 
me too! you seem just like me!
my husband and i closed on our first house last week!
that sounds very exciting! what kind of planning did you put into such an achievement?
it is! lots of blood  _comma_   sweat and tears   and lots of phone calls and signing things  _comma_   haha .  we can t wait to move in!
that s so cool! i wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness _comma_  joy and fun times!
my daughter moved to california and a few months later she got in a car accident and was on the other side of the country so there was nothing i could immediately do . 
are there any other family members out there that could help her?
no .  she asked her friend to call me after it happened but wasn t able to tell me many details . 
wow  _comma_   i hope that she was able to work things out .  not the best way to start living somewhere far from home  _comma_   but i m sure she figured something out . 
they took her to the hospital for evaluation but she ended up just being a bit bruised up .  i was worried something like this would happen .  everything did work out in the end though . 
recently i was contacted by my former company _comma_  begging to get me back .  i felt really good about the salary negotiation since i knew they needed me . 
that s great! i am happy for you!
thanks  _comma_   i m happy about it .  i only have to work a few hours a week  _comma_   it s pretty amazing . 
yeah _comma_  and they are paying you good enough .  you are a luckiest person!
i was shocked to learn that i had been called to serve on a jury !
i honestly have never gone to jury duty  _comma_  but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule 
yes i am not looking forward to it .   ive heard that its just awful . 
same thing i heard too  _comma_  really long and boring being there against your will 
yes i think it is going to be a long week or so . 
my dog died this past december and i ve had a really hard time getting over it .  she was our family pet . 
i am so sorry to hear that .  i have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past _comma_  so i can understand what you re going through .  i m sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family . 
she really was a wonderful pet .  we just got a puppy recently _comma_  which is the same breed as the one who passed away .  she s bringing some light back into our lives .  
aww that s great! what breed? 
the worst day of my life was when i was   months pregnant with our first child and i started bleeding like crazy . 
oh no! that sounds so scary .  was everything ok?
yes _comma_  thankfully everything turned out fine .  i had to spend   weeks in the hospital though!
good i m glad to hear that .   that s a long time .   hospitals scare me _comma_  i can t imagine being there for that long
my doggie recently passed away
i m so sorry to hear that! hopefully he or she wasn t in too much pain at the end . 
no i don t think so _comma_  but it was violent .   she was run over by a car .   
oh my gosh that s horrible .  i hope they caught the person who hit her!
i don t think i will ever know .  they usually don t stop when that happens . 
the other day i woke up and without looking i stepped in warm cat vomit . 
oh man _comma_  that s gross! at least it was vomit and not something else . 
yeah it was pretty gross but one of my cats is pretty pukey _comma_  i should have known better and watched where i was walking . 
how many cats do have?
well right now i have six but they re not all mine  _comma_   i foster for a cat rescue .  three are mine  _comma_   three are for adoption .  it gets crazy in my house!
my dog died last year .  
aw _comma_  i am so sorry .  how long did you have your dog for?
about   years .  he was a rescue . 
they say dogs are mans best friend .  
that s true .  he was definitely mine . 
what kind of dog was he?
he was a pit and lab mix . 
nice _comma_  i have an australian shepherd .  he follows me around everywhere .  
the worst phone call i ever got in my life was when i was told my dad only had a few weeks left to live . 
oh no .  that s terrible .  i lost my dad five years ago _comma_  i know how terrible that feels . 
i m sorry to hear that .  i m going on just over two years .  never thought it would happen to us . 
neither did we .  he seemed so healthy  _comma_   and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn t even talk .  i miss him every day  _comma_  
they will live on in our love and memories .  i hope the heaviness lessens one day at a time   
the other day i checked my email and a former client i did some freelance work had emailed me a gift card out of the blue! i was happy . 
surprise gifts are always fun . 
very! i decided since it was surprise money i would waste it on something fun . 
that sounds like a well deserved plan . 
i remember the first i went to a theme park .   i had been planning on the way there not to go on any roller coasters _comma_  but just being there changed my mind quickly . 
oh man  _comma_   i can relate  _comma_   that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment
exactly .   i just saw how much fun it looked and i thought to myself i should just live a little .   it s not often you get to have experiences like that . 
life is full of experiences like that  _comma_   they seem scary from the outside  _comma_   but once you relax you get swept away
i lost      cash somewhere .  i have looked everywhere and i can t find it
that sounds prettty bad!
yes _comma_  i have retraced my steps and i can t find it .   hopefully i will find it when i need it the most . 
i cannot imagine if something like that happens to me .  i would be trying very hard to find it . 
i have looked everywhere .  it s so frustrating . 
sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help .  i will try that!
i really hate when people let their kids run wild in public .  i do believe kids should be kids but there is a time and place for it . 
i agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think .  
the worst is when they re screaming at them rather than just speaking to them calmly .  
the frustration they go through well at least we don t have to take the kids or parents home . 
i wanted to go and get the tissue that was on sale was so bummed it was sold out . 
what store were you at? 
i was going to walgreen s and they was out and the sale began today .  
could you get a rain check? that is a bummer? 
it get s worse no rain check but they insist on giving me customer service number to still receive points towards my card . 
it was my birthday and felt like no one really cared 
aw man _comma_  i m sorry to hear that .  is there anything i can do to make you feel better? 
thanks! my coworker went out on lunch break and bought my favorite ice cream cake!
ice cream cake is my favorite! i m glad you re feeling better haha .  you have a really nice co worker . 
yes she is honestly the greatest 
that s really awesome! she sounds like a great person to work with . 
i completely ate the last cupcake even though i know my husband will want one when he gets home .  should i go get some more?
oh  _comma_   i know how that goes .  my husband loves sweets  _comma_   but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it it will get eaten right then .  getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them .  lol
right! it s almost like _comma_  you knew this was going to happen .  i feel terrible but it was so good lol .  i ll get him some more tomorrow!
that s probably what i would do also .  it won t kill him to wait another day . 
i was at the store the other day and the lady ahead of me had no idea how to use self checkout _comma_  i wish she would have used the regular line instead of holding everyone up . 
oh i hate when that happens .  we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines . 
exactly! i wasn t in a hurry or anything but it felt so inconsiderate . 
hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don t hold the line up in the future . 
we can only hope . 
when i was in high school there was a girl i had liked for a long time that ended up dating my best friend . 
oh man _comma_  that must have hurt .  did she know you had feelings for her?
yes .  but at the time she was unavailable .  then when she wasn t spoken for my  friend  asked her out . 
sounds like your friend broke bro code _comma_  that was kind of scummy . 
i had mentioned to my friend one day that my computer was pretty much on its way out .   some time later i found that he had sent me the money to buy a new one . 
wow! what a nice friend .  i wish my friends did that
yea i was really thankful and appreciative for it .   he s like a brother to me . 
that s great .  it s nice to have people so close to you .  it really helps in bad times
it really does .   i think when it comes to friends quality is better than quantity .   i like to have friends that feel like family . 
i cried so hard seeing my baby girl walk across the stage at her vpk graduation . 
that must of been a proud moment for you as a father .   she s all grown up and out in the real world now
yes this is a new milestone and now she get s to see what real school is all about with all age groups . 
that s awesome _comma_  she ll have a great time and learn a lot i m sure!
i entered a raffle at a local fair and actually won       . 
wow! what are you gonna do with the winnings?
oh they are long gone _comma_ lol .  bills to pay and all . 
bills do take up a lot _comma_  don t they . 
they sure do .  the raffle did allow me to get ahead of things for a while though . 
one time i moved into a new apartment  _comma_   it was this big loft in a converted warehouse .  i had this automatic soap dispenser that went nuts on me and made this really scary sound  _comma_   i thought the place was haunted!
oh my gosh! thats funny .   was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted?
haha yeah it was pretty funny once i realized what the spooky sound coming from the kitchen was . 
how did you discover exactly what it was?
i turned off the tv and my phone and tried to trace the sound to its source .  i feel ridiculous about it now in hindsight!
i have a fear for roller coaster but i let my siblings talk me into getting on one last night . 
roller coasters are scary for me .  how was it for you?
fun but scary i couldn t wait for it to end lol had my eyes closed most of the ride .  
i m the same way haha .  but how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time?!
my hands was up and feeling the wind in my face and facing my fears but i kept them closed because i just couldn t look because of the height lol .  
i had to put my cat down a few years ago _comma_  she was old and in kidney failure . 
i am so sorry to hear that .  i m sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys . 
she had a good life .  she was actually my mom s cat _comma_  she came to live with me when my mom died . 
you went through a lot of losses . 
someone buggy was in the way at publix and i tripped and fell in the aisle .  
that sounds painful _comma_  i hope you were okay after your fall .  
i was ok just the look on m face let you know i was ashamed lol i turned red instantly .  
yeah i bet that was really embarrassing _comma_  but i m glad you re okay .  
i applied for a job one time where i was one of   people being considered for it and had to wait a week to find out if i got it . 
oh boy!  that s always a nail biter waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know .  did you get it?!!
i did get it! if i was a praying kind of guy i would have done so every day .  i was o nervous . 
amazing! congratulation! prayer is always a good thing to do! that is so incredible .   are you enjoying the job?
i remember being younger and waiting on christmas day to unwrap presents .   there were a lot of things i wanted that year . 
i remember those times .  did you get what you wanted?
well i was really looking forward to the super nintendo .   it had just come out that year and everyone my age wanted one . 
the super nintendo is a classic .  what is your favorite game?
yea _comma_  they tried to trick me and wrap a box of clothes the same size to make me think i didn t get it .   my favorite game has to be earthbound . 
i fell off my bike the other day in front of a bunch of people .  it was kind of humiliating . 
oh no! i m so sorry!  i would feel the same way but you just have to think . who cares what others think!  if they can t have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them .   did you get hurt?
you re right  _comma_   the other people probably hardly noticed .  and no  _comma_   thankfully i was ok! unless you count the bruise on my ego . 
i bet they didn t .   i like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations .   so glad you re alright! hope you own a helmet!
that s solid advice   _comma_    thank you .  and yes   _comma_    i own a helmet   _comma_    but admittedly don t wear it as often as i should .  i will now!
this one year right after i moved to the east coast we had this scary hurricane warning .  i went ahead and stocked up on all the basics; batteries  _comma_   canned goods  _comma_   beer .  i was set!
how d the hurricane go?
wouldn t you know it totally missed my city .  i was a little let down to be honest _comma_  though glad we were safe . 
thank goodness .  hurricanes are no joke . 
i was going on a trip and couldn t take my dog so i had to board him and i was so worried about it . 
was he okay?
he was fine .  i just didn t know how he was going to handle it _comma_  he is a very nervous dog . 
well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it .  i would be afraid just because he is afraid . 
that s true .  he was a rescue and sometimes i wonder if he was treated in a bad way and thats why he is like that . 
maybe so .  it s good he has a good home now . 
i like to think he does .  i just hope he is as happy as he makes me . 
i bet he is .  don t worry
i usually food prep for the week it is so much easier . 
that is a great idea
yes it works out great saves me money and keeps my scheduled arranged and on track .  
saving money is important
my daughter graduated high school as a straight a student last year
that s amazing! you must be so proud . 
oh i am .  it s nice to know that i raised a child with a good head on her shoulders . 
she s also a hard worker . 
i like to think so _comma_  although it seemed to alwasy be easy for her .  
yesterday my lyft driver offered to carry my groceries up to my apartment .  i thought that was super nice _comma_  there were a lot of bags . 
that was very sweet they don t have to actually do that . 
it was sweet .  and i told him not to worry about it _comma_  i didn t want to hold him up .  
good to know there is still kind people in the world . 
i got some pink roses at work last week i was so happy . 
that s awesome! who were they from?
my husband but i didn t expect it i was so surprised they was a just because gift . 
that was really sweet of him _comma_  maybe he just wanted you to know you re loved . 
i am about to leave on a    hour car trip with my husband  _comma_   our four kids  _comma_   and   dogs .  i think i have everything ready to go though
you can never be too prepared! i am sure you have got everything . 
i hope so .  i even portioned out each meal for our dogs in little plastic bags to make sure we have enough .  
that was very smart thinking on your part .  have fun on your trip!
i sent an email i shouldn t have sent .  i d been drinking and totally should have saved it rather than sending it when i did . 
we all do things we regret when drinking
true .  the funny thing was i obsessed over it for days _comma_  worrying i made a mistake .  and absolutely nothing happened! i worried for nothing . 
thats usually how it goes
a few years ago i decided to move cross country .  it was kind of terrifying taking a huge leap like that with no job and hardly knowing anyone here . 
you definitely took a leap of faith there .  how d it go?
it definitely has had its ups and downs but overall i m really glad i did it .  i don t think i ll be doing it again any time soon that s for sure . 
hahaha i definitely admire your courage to have done that . 
i m going back to school i am going to stick to my goal and don t stop until i get my degree . 
i wish you luck
thanks i am super excited i know i will have a great outcome i have goals to meet . 
i am sure you will meet them
i spent my birthday last year alone .  i expected my boyfriend to make plans but nope . 
that s disappointing .  what happened? did he just not do anything?
yeah  _comma_   he acted like it was just a normal day  _comma_   it was so weird .  maybe i m getting too old to make a big deal out of birthdays anyway . 
i would have been disappointed _comma_  too .  
i get so annoyed when it rains i had plans for a family cookout but it started thundering and lightening such a bummer .  
oh no that is a total bummer .  it s especially common in the summer months . 
yes it s the worse especially in florida it s sunny one day and pouring down raining the next .  
oh right _comma_  i spent some time in florida when i was younger and i remember it being so unpredictable .  just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lol . 
i went to a book release party yesterday . 
cool .  was it interesting?
yes .  it was a good friend of mine .  she got a novel published! she also has four small kids .  i m not sure how she does it all . 
good for her! moms get a lot done lol
my best friend is moving across the country next week .  
are you happy or sad?
sad .  i will miss her terribly 
i bet .  i she moving school or a job?
my job recognized me for my hard work i was thankful and surprised i just love my job . 
oh cool that s great! what were you doing that they recognised?
for over exceeding and helping all staff when in need _comma_  i am always just helpful but was happy to get noticed for my hard work . 
awesome .  what is your job?
i work for the state we help clients with disabilities find employment it is case management work . 
i got a random email this morning with a      gift voucher
wow was it a scam or was it legit?
i was really sure it was a scam but it turned out it was a prize for a survey i had submitted a few weeks ago!
that is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for?
thanks! no idea actually _comma_  it s for a department store here in australia so will have to look around
there was an  incident  at the gym today . 
oh no _comma_  what happened?
i finished a fabulous workout _comma_  then promptly fell up the stairs on my way to the locker room .  in front of everyone .  i was mortified . 
oh no! but that happens (it has happened to me several times) .  at least you had the great workout!
after four long  _comma_   broke months of looking  _comma_   i finally got offered a job today!
that s great .  are you excited?
yes _comma_  and incredibly happy .  i was getting really worried about the bills .  
is it your dream job? then you should really be happy . 
i had an email telling me i had a      gift voucher this morning
was it real?
haha that was my first thought too .  it actually was!
that s awesome .  what are you going to buy?
thanks! no idea actually _comma_  it s for a department store here in australia
australia .  i hope to go there some day
you definitely should! it s a really cool place _comma_  but so hard to see everything because it s so big
i bet _comma_  i will get there one day
i knocked over a clothing display on the sidewalk outside of a boutique the other day when i was riding my bike .  i should have gone back to pick it up but kept going . 
i ve done the same thing before .  i m sure you weren t a bother
i hope not .  now that you mention it i m sure it happens all the time . 
yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks
i was waiting for a while for a video game to come out .   when it finally did it wasn t as great as i thought it was going to be . 
that has happend to me too . 
i got my hopes up too much .  i should wait for reviews to come out before i rush out and buy next time . 
you can always sell them if you buy discs .  cant do anything with a download though
that s very true .   which is why i prefer physical discs most of the time . 
we live and we learn lol
exactly .   next time i m waiting for prices to drop _comma_  months after launch . 
the other day i was listening to spotify and put u  s achtung baby on .  it reminds me of pre middle school days . 
i used to love that band
yeah they were great back in the day .  i can t comment on their new stuff _comma_  i haven t listened to any of it in years . 
i have not either
so the cable repair guy was supposed to show up between  :   and   :   on friday .  guess when he showed up . 
probably at   or  ! lol
you got it .   :   .  why does this still happen? i wasted the whole day waiting .  
no idea! i haven t had cable in so long! i would hate that and they always over charge! don t they have a rule that theres no service fee if they are late?
i got a random email telling me i had won a gift card
was it real because i get those every day lol
haha yeah it actually turned out to be real! it was for     
i could do so much with      .  im jealous lol
we had a near disaster at our house today . 
oh no! what happened?
my older son called from the bathroom that we were out of toilet paper .  it seemed . um . urgent . fortunately _comma_  we had an emergency stash in the laundry room . 
ah _comma_  crisis averted! that could have been a lot worse
we went to our favorite italian restaurant for dinner tonight . 
was it good? i hate when your favorite place disappoints . 
it was good! it always is .  i had my  usual  pasta and just enough wine to feel relaxed _comma_  but not loopy .  it was a good way to end a sunday . 
that s great .  sundays are supposed to be breezy
i didn t have a pen while returning a rental car to an unattended location
hm   _comma_    that sounds interesting .  i m not really familiar with this kind of situation   _comma_    since i ve never had to rent a car .  what exactly happened   _comma_    or what did that mean?
yeah i was travelling in the us and they just had a drop box where you put the keys and a form in .  luckily i asked a stranger who was passing by and they gave me a really nice pen to keep
oh  _comma_   so it was no big deal? at least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it .  no harm  _comma_   no foul . 
i recently got an email from my old company hinting that they wanted me back .  it was kind of exciting _comma_  i really wanted it to work out . 
i bet that was a nice feeling
it definitely was .  the money is great and i get to set my own hours!
that sounds perfect
i have a dentist appointment first thing tomorrow morning .  
the dentist makes me a bit nervous
it makes me very nervous .  i hate it .  i ll probably barely sleep tonight because of it .  
well at least think about the fact that it s a good thing to go to the dentist!
i got back from vacation last week and found a huge dent in my car .  
that is awful _comma_  did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number? 
no .  they just hit it and left the airport parking lot .  i m pretty incensed .  
you should ask the airport people if they have any security footage of the parking lot _comma_  maybe they can track down the car . 
i went to the fanciest dinner party the other night .  it was  eight amazing courses of food!
what kind of food was there?
really intricate things   souffles and such .  i was very impressed . 
it is nice that you enjoyed it . 
i saw a mouse run across my kitchen last night .  i woke everyone up with my screaming . 
oh man .   that would of startled me too .   what did you do after?
stood on the couch and screamed some more! i do not do rodents .  i m having my son handle it .  i think he s putting out traps tonight . 
well i can understand your nervousness .   i probably would be on guard as well
my kitty that i had since she was a kitten passed away .  she was only four years old . 
oh that is tough .   it is hard when our pets pass away . 
it really is .  she was the first pet that was really  mine  .  she brought a lot of happiness to my life!
it is like losing a family member isn t it .   well _comma_  just think of all the good times and be thankful . 
i had a test the other day and i m pretty sure i aced it .  i studied for like a week!
that s great! i never really studied much so i could have done better on my tests
same here .  i never had to study for high school but when i hit college _comma_  it was a wakeup call . 
oh yes .  but  _comma_   i found that getting involved in clubs along with a major i liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun .  it s a subtle  _comma_   but important diffeence
so all my friends went on vacation last week :(
judging by the :( _comma_  i m assuming you didn t get to join them?
yeah  _comma_   we were supposed to go but i couldn t get off work .  i got to see all the pictures on facebook though  _comma_   ha! so envious . 
i would be envious too .   perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling :d
sounds like a plan :)
i hope where ever you go _comma_  you visit someplace amazing!
man i am stuffed .   i found a new pizza joint in town . 
that is nice .  do you like a lot pizza?
yeah i definitely like a lot of pizza .   this place had a all you can eat buffet .   i ate my fill of pizza!
you are lucky . 
i made sure it was the only thing i ate all day .   i was pretty content . 
man i couldn t get any sleep last night . 
were you worried about something? what was keeping you up?
there was something scratching on my window .   i was pretty nervous . 
hopefully you had a lock on them _comma_  you can never be too safe . 
well that s the thing .   when i looked out in the morning i didn t see anything . 
one year for our anniversary _comma_  an ipad showed up at my office .  my boyfriend had ordered it and timed it so arrived on our exact anniversary .  i didn t expect it at all!
dang really! sounds like you have a boyfriend that likes to shower you with presents . 
he s generous yeah but i wouldn t call it  showering .   he s just good about knowing what i need!
that means that he is always listening and paying attention to you!
i used to enjoy cold showers in the morining . 
i have never tried a cold shower? what is it like?
it s very cold and refreshing _comma_  wakes you up instantly . 
i bet it does wake you up right away .  i guess i should try that sometime if i oversleep .  lol !
my neighbor refuses to clean up after her dog and it s infuriating . 
wow that is very rude of her
it really is .  i m not sure what to do though besides reporting her to the hoa .  any suggestion?
no i have never dealt with a rude person like that that lives near me
lucky you! for some reason i seem to be attracted to apartments filled with rude people . 
what else do we need _comma_  just a sunny bench and some chips . 
i totally agree .  that actually sounds really good rihgt now . 
so lets go _comma_  i ll meet you outside in an hour .  
sounds fun .  ill be ready .  hope were going to the beach thats closest to us!
i am looking forward for tomorrow .  
 i will be expecting to see you there . 
yes _comma_  tomorrow as well as today are such a nice places .  
having positive attitude always succeed .  keep it up . 
i was walking around town yesterday and saw a girl with crazy hairstyle . 
interesting .   what was the first thought that popped into your head when you witnessed this?
it was . dandelion .  
is that a reference to the color of the hair _comma_  the shape or something else?
man i felt good when i applied for my job!
how did it go? that s an anxiety inducing but hopeful situation!
no i was very assured in my interview .   i got the job _comma_  probably because of my attitude . 
congratulations! enjoy the new gig! good things happen to good people . 
i could definitely feel it going to other way if i was defeatist in my interview . 
being defeatist is never a good move .  honestly _comma_  once you ve got your foot in the door i think it s all about personality .  
it can be _comma_  but personality can t make up for incomptence either . 
i would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation .  if they can t _comma_  maybe they aren t good employers . 
i flipped through my high school yearbooks the other day for the first time in a long time .  i can t believe how much time has passed . 
time does fly really fast .  i just turned    and it feels like i was just a teenager yesterday!
enjoy it _comma_  your   s go by really fast .  i m clinging desperately to the last few years of mine myself . 
i m sure it will .  at least it gets us to enjoy life more and focus on the moment . 
it s very strange when you meet somebody you know _comma_  in the middle of a megalopolis .  
yeah _comma_  it s like a small world . 
exactly _comma_  how does it even work?
i think it is merely a coincidence . 
small thing in life used to make me shed tears . 
indeed they can .  is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about?
yes _comma_  things like great classical music for example .  
oh _comma_  i see .  i thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry
we have to stay positive through all the things that happen in the world .  
i completely agree .  we must have positive thoughts at all times .  
yes _comma_  that s a good start . 
our thoughts are were everything starts .  mindset is so important .  
someone my husband used to work with got a promotion and a really big raise . 
that s awesome!  what do they do?
they work in the oil field .  my husband left the company they both worked for and i can t help but think if he still worked their he would have gotten a raise too . 
that would be nice _comma_  but it s never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future . 
last week driving to work _comma_  i got pulled over for speeding . 
that sucks .  how fast were you driving?
only a couple miles over .  it s always a terrible thing to see those lights in your mirror . 
i hate getting pulled over too .  especailly for something silly like being a couple of miles an hour over the speed limit
i haven t drank beer in almost a year _comma_  but yesterday i relapsed .  i feel like such a loser . 
oh man _comma_  i m so sorry to hear that .  you re not a loser though! just take one day at a time .  if you relapsed yesterday just move on and do your best not to drink today and tomorrow
i just can t believe i gave in to the pressure .  oh well _comma_  yeah your right .  i ll start by taking baby steps . 
don t be so hard on yourself .  we are all humans _comma_  we make mistakes .  
my neighbor is remodeling his house  _comma_   which i hate  _comma_   because they start at  :   in the morning . 
that is probably so annoying
i have a   year old _comma_  so he wakes up at  :   because of all the hammering going on . 
that really sucks .  how long will it be going on?
my wife told me she s pregnant the other day .  i was baffled by the news because the doctor told us she only had a ten percent chance of having a baby . 
wow .   that s either really lucky or unlucky _comma_  depending on what you want .   are you wanting kids?
yeah _comma_  it just came at an unexpected time .  i really want a little boy . 
well  _comma_   then congratulations!  i wish you the best of luck  _comma_   and enjoy this time! :)
i went to see a movie last night .  i wasn t really able to enjoy it though . 
why not?
there was this couple sitting two rows in front of me .  they just wouldn t shut up . 
oh man! that is why i watch movies at home .  it s just more comfortable . 
i saw a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday .  it was alright _comma_  but i have to admit i was a bit skeptical at first . 
i have considered it myself but feel the same as you .  will you go back again? 
i might .  it just makes me a little uneasy having to share personal information with a total stranger . 
right _comma_  i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!! 
my mom called me about a year ago and told me she had cancer . 
is she doing okay now?
yes _comma_  she had a really difficult   months and then things started improving .  
great _comma_  i am very glad to hear she is getting better!
i was very pleased to get this job
what is the job?
i got the job has an software analysis and that was aim
well congrats then _comma_  i am sure that is not easy
a little bit .  but when we doing it in a rightway from our heart really it will be easy 
i was so angry _comma_  i threw a bottle of water!
what caused that to happen?
a server went down and i didn t get paid for my work :(
oh gosh _comma_  hopefully it doesnt happen next time
yeah i hope not _comma_  i can t afford work stoppages!
i felt nostalgic looking through old photos today
what were the photos of?
just old family photos
it is good to have those and look at once in awhile
a couple months ago _comma_  my wife and i got divorced . 
i am sorry to hear that _comma_  what happened?
we just grew apart i guess .  house seems so empty with her and the kids gone . 
did you try therapy at all or counseling?
we can t afford to live in our home anymore
why is that?
we re poor _comma_  and bills are adding up
i am sorry to hear that _comma_  i hope things improve for you a ton!
thank you! i do as well
boy _comma_  it s been a lot of owrk
sometimes we believe is the things that happen to us  .  they are many
what sort of things?
i interpret the difficulties
what sort of difficulties 
the lack of humor
ah _comma_  it s no joke is it
ok
last year _comma_  my father passed away . 
oh goodness _comma_  i am so sorry to hear that .  was it sudden?
yeah _comma_  he developed a stage   glioma in his brain that could not be removed . 
that is awful and very sorry you had to go through that .  i work at a cancer hospital so i can t imagine going through that with a loved one . 
i feel nostalgic going through old boxes in my basement
what kind of stuff is in there?
just old sports uniforms and toys and stuff like that
oh okay  _comma_   i love going through my old stuff too  _comma_   it is really fun
i have plans so go to the beach with my wife for a week next month
that sounds so fun!
i cant wait! we have been looking forward to going back since our honeymoon . 
i hope you both have tons of fun!
thank you .  we plan on it!
i m so glad my health is good
that s great! i m glad to hear that .  we often take our health for granted . 
we do _comma_  and don t do enough to take care of it
i m one of those people .  eat junk food even though i know it s not good for me
ah _comma_  it ll catch up to you :(
oh man .  i can t believe i made that mistake at work today . 
uh oh what happened
i was giving a presentation on the project that i m working on _comma_  and i overlooked something simple .  one of my coworkers called me out on it .  how embarrassing . 
oh no  _comma_   well mistakes do happen  _comma_   it will be behind you in a few days
i certainly hope so .  the sooner everyone forgets about this _comma_  the better . 
exactly good luck
thank you _comma_  i m just glad it was at the end of the presentation so i was able to get out of there shortly after . 
i love to see old stuff from when i was a kid
oh yeah? what kind of old stuff?
old metal lunch boxes like charlies angels speed buggy ect
i always liked those old lunch boxes myself .  do you have a favorite?
hong kong phooey lol
nice! i loved that show when i was a kid .  i never had the lunch box though . 
it s time to move!
oh _comma_  ok!  where are you moving to?
another house _comma_  it s closer to school
that s good!  that will make your life much easier!  congratulations!
so there s a girl that i ve been talking to lately .  i m thinking about asking her out . 
that s exciting .  do you have a plan for a date for when she says yes?
yeah  _comma_   i already have it all planned out .  we get along really well  _comma_   so i m sure she s going to say yes . 
what all is on the agenda for the date?
i m going to take her to this restaurant she really likes _comma_  then go to a movie .  i m gonna show her a great time . 
i ve finally finished writing the book that i ve been working on for the last few months . 
great .  are you going to get it published?
definitely! i m pretty happy with this one _comma_  can t wait to get it published . 
what is the book about?
to say anything about it at all would be giving too much away!
boo .  what genre?
oh man .  i was cleaning out my fridge _comma_  and found something unpleasant . 
oh no that is the worst! did you clean it up?
well i threw it out .  it was some unidentifiable stuff in a plastic container .  it had been in there for months _comma_  i think . 
you shoudl write the date on stuff to prevent that from happening again
you know  _comma_   that s not a bad idea .  ugh  _comma_   it was so disgusting . 
my little one got injured
oh no! what happened?
she fell off a kitchen stool
ouch .  i hope she s okay . 
whew .  i had a lot of housework to get done _comma_  but it s finally finished . 
thats good _comma_  its always a good feeling after
yeah _comma_  i m pretty happy .  now i can just sit back and relax . 
thats the way to do it
i agree .  now i don t have anything to worry about for the rest of the day . 
i was delighted with how well my nephew did at his little league game
did his team win?
yes
that s great news! i bet you re so proud . 
my clothing is making me crazy
oh no!  why are they driving you crazy?
they re totally itchy
that is no good!  i guess it is time for you to go shopping!
i admired the way my nieghbors helped each other out after a storm
storms are the worst and destroy so much . 
they are horrible _comma_  luckily this one wasnt deadly or too destructive
my family went through a big storm a few years ago . 
i got a terrible phone call yesterday . 
what happened on the phone call?
i found out that my brother died . 
i am so sorry about that . 
thank you _comma_  i m pretty devastated to be honest . 
ugh _comma_  my cat keeps attacking my foot . 
has it made any scratch marks?
nah    _comma_     he just keeps running up    _comma_     grabbing and biting    _comma_     then running away .  it was cute and funny at first    _comma_     now it s just irritating . 
have you tried disciplining him in anyway
yeah  _comma_   i ve sprayed him with a water bottle a few times  _comma_   it doesn t seem to work very well . 
sounds like it s time for a crate . 
it is frustrating waiting on hold to speak to a human
yea _comma_  i hate calling att or verizon they take forever to get on the phone . 
it is so annoying!
i think as we get smarter _comma_  it will get better . 
i didn t expect to get anything for my birthday from my fiance since he s been broke _comma_  but he gave me a bouquet of flowers and took me out to eat still!
wow!  sounds like a keeper right there!  that must have been a nice surprise for you!
it really was! he had to scrimp and save _comma_  but it was worth it for both of us in the end :)
it is always nice when someone gets their priorities right!
so .  my dog got hit by a car last night . 
oh no!  that is horrible!  is he ok?
no _comma_  unfortunately he didn t make it . 
that is really sad!  i hope it was quick and painless .   i hate seeing anything suffer!
yeah  _comma_   i think it was  _comma_   but .  i m pretty upset about it . 
my son asked to borrow the keys to my car this morning . 
did you let him borrow it?
yeah .  i know most people would be worried about doing something like that _comma_  but .  i trust him not to do anything stupid . 
that s good to hear .  i assume everything went ok?
yeah _comma_  he brought it back in one piece .  which i m obviously happy about . 
awesome .  alls well that ends well . 
my daughter asked to borrow my car to go out tonight . 
did you say yes?
i haven t given an answer yet .  i m just not sure if it s a wise idea or not . 
where does she plan to go?
she says she s just going to meet some friends at the movies _comma_  but you know how teenagers are . 
boy _comma_  it was nice when i wasn t so poor
money problems are never fun .  trust me _comma_  i know . 
i m sorry to hear that :( it d be nice if work paid better
yeah _comma_  definitely .  have you tried asking for a raise?
i was sad when i had to put my dog down last month
oh no  _comma_   i m so so sorry .  i ve always had at least one pet throughout my life  _comma_   and they re truly part of the family . 
they are very much family .  i cannot believe we get so attached . 
yes  _comma_   they re honestly more dear to me than my friends .  i hope you re doing okay   i m sure your dog was very loved and had a wonderful life  _comma_   so try to take comfort in that . 
i was recently promoted at my job .  i didn t expect it to happen _comma_  but i got it through hard work so i m pretty excited about it!
that is great! doing what?
thank you! i m now a district manager for a local chain of businesses .  it s not my favorite thing to do _comma_  but the raise is great!
i bet that is nice and probably has good benefits!
i recently went on a long road trip .  i wasn t too worried  _comma_   though  _comma_   because i packed everything i needed to make it as stress free as possible .   
i can never go on long trips . 
why not? they used to bother me  _comma_   but i m finding that as i get older  _comma_   they re not so bad . 
i can no longer afford them _comma_  long trips cost the most . 
that s unfortunate .  i ve come to enjoy taking a train as a frugal alternative to flying or driving .  no wear and tear on your car _comma_  and you don t have to drive . 
i kept laughing at myself for falling down
oh no! .  are you ok? must not have been a bad one if you were laughing?
not bad but it was funny because i slipped on a banana peel!
how ironic .  i kind of wish i were there to see it . 
i compete in the highland games around the country .  i just got a new kilt and i look amazing .  
i am bad at every game . 
it s a little different .  it s based in picking up and throwing objects like logs _comma_  hammers that weight    pounds and stones that weight    pounds .  being scottish it keeps me feeling at home . 
i still could not do that _comma_  i am very weak human person . 
you can do anything you set your mind to . 
i ve been very stressed out at work .  i had it in my budget so i hired a new office manager .  i m having issues trusting her . 
do what i did _comma_  quit the job and live at home with mom . 
i wish .  my mom kicked me out at    and i ve only seen her a handful of times since over the last    years . 
i still thing living with a relative is the cheapest way to go . 
i actually really want to buy a van and live in it but my wife said no . 
i just pulled up my student loan bill .  i ve been out of school    years and still owe   k . 
that s awful! luckily i paid all mine off _comma_  but i know many people still struggle with it
it started off at    k so i ve paid a lot but it s still crazy .  make me think i would have been better off to just go work construction or something instead of college .  
yea . the education costs are atrocious and  _comma_   honestly  _comma_   not even worth it on my opinion .  it s just the piece of paper .  the material you learn from them can be learned online for free or nearly so
i agree .  i feel like i ve learned just as much or more from mocc s since then . 
my boss is piling on the work but keeping my pay the same .  he claims he can t afford to pay me more _comma_  but i know that s not true . 
typical of most companies .   ask employees to do more and pay less . 
yep  _comma_   it s so frustrating .  i m ready to shake up the system but i feel limited in what i can do  _comma_   besides quit . 
what kind of job do you have?
i m so shocked _comma_  my pants fell down in public
i m sorry _comma_  did anyone see?
i m hoping not _comma_  but it s possible
i hope you would wear a belt next time . 
lol yes _comma_  i learned my lesson
my best friend has the best job ever .  she is paid to travel the world full time and write blogs on different locations . 
that sounds like a blast .   compared to my job lol .   
yes _comma_  i know .  ever day i drive an hour to the same place that is slowly killing me inside and she is jetting off to explore . 
i m sorry .   i like my job but its certainly not like hers!
just finished my budget for the week .  woowa _comma_  i m in trouble it s going to be a rice and beans week . 
lol .   be careful .  thats a ton of carbs . 
it s better then the alternative .  one good meal then water and ketchup soup the rest of the week . 
eww lol
yea _comma_  rice and beans is so much better then that .  
i just had my birthday  _comma_   and my family and fiance did everything they could to make it special .  i don t have much  _comma_   but i m thankful to have them at least . 
happy birthday!
thank you! i hope your birthday  _comma_   whenever it is  _comma_   is awesome as well!
what all did they do for you?
got a big bouquet of flowers  _comma_   they took me out to eat (lunch and dinner)  _comma_   and we went to the drive in to top it off :)
i was proud when my dog learned to sit . 
how long did it take for you to teach you dog that?
a few days .  he was so happy!
i thought i would take longer _comma_  like months!
this week my work offered to let me work an extra day .  i thought great overtime .  nope they plan to send me home every other day to even it out
oh no .  maybe you can get some things done around the house . 
yea like working on my resume and netflix . 
lol _comma_  that sounds like a plan .  working two jobs is hard . 
i m so happy i ate good food
yummy .  what did you eat?  i am hungry . 
i had chicken  _comma_   asparagus  _comma_   and a portobello mushroom
that sounds so good .   like i love that stuff . 
i m so happy that no one in my family is sick
i am glad no one in your family is sick . 
thank you! i hope no one in yours is either
thank goodness my family is healthy too . 
 went for a job interview .  i got the job offer but they offered me less money then i all ready make for more work . 
but do they give raises more frequently and do they have better benefits .  it may be worth it still _comma_ 
not for the first few years .  the title would be a move up in status but the pay is about a   % downgrade .  i can t take that loss . 
benefits are worth a lot more than you think sometimes
i m so excited to go out to dinner tomorrow!
is there a special reason?
no _comma_  we just won t be home so we have to eat out
going anywhere good?
pickle barrel
that sounds fun
i m been loosing weight january .  i m down    pounds .  i have    more to go but i m happy . 
that is great .  how have you done it?
i ve always walked a lot at work .  i average    miles a day so kept doing that but i cut out all processed food and drinks .  
that is a lot of walking .  i can hardly walk   mile . 
i average about    _comma_     steps a week . 
my wife went on a trip for a week to see her family but i had to work so i had to stay home alone . 
i have never been on a trip before . 
i wish i could have went on this one but i couldn t .  it ended up bein a long week by myself . 
i have long weeks every single day . 
my current job isn t working out _comma_  so i ve applied to several others . 
i would just quit and live off the government . 
haha _comma_  i would if i could! sounds a like much more laidback way to live . 
everyone can! just gotta try . 
i found a new stray dog eating out the dumpster last thursday .  today i officially adopted her . 
how sweet and thoughtful of you
i already love her .  this is the second stray i ve found eating out the same dumpster .  they are now sisters . 
you seem to be a very compassionate person _comma_  very kindhearted . 
about   years ago i was diagnosed with cancer . 
ohh _comma_  i so sorry . 
thank you _comma_  it was a very scary situation to be in . 
hope you are doing better .  i ll pray for you . 
i m doing good now after the chemo and radiation .  it is in total remission now . 
good for you! stay healthy
i ve been trying to eat healthier and work out more _comma_  but so far i ve only been somewhat successful . 
forget that! eat pizza and enjoy life . 
oh i definitely do both of those things as much as i can .  pizza   perfection
i agree _comma_  i eat what i want when i want all the time . 
if i had the metabolism to do that _comma_  i d definitely be following your example . 
i m so scared to move to a new home
you have to have fun!
how can i do that?
get drunk and go out!
just got home from the grocery store .  forgot my wallet at home .  got to check out and had to apologize to the cashier and leave with out anything .  
i never go to the store anymore _comma_  i wish i did . 
why not? dollar store has something for everyone . 
not for me _comma_  i shop online mostly these days . 
you ship food to your house?
i m about to start a new job _comma_  and i m really nervous about it . 
just go for it! never look back!
okay _comma_  i ll take your advice! wish me luck!
best of luck my friend _comma_  you can do anything . 
i get so mad when i watch shows about animal shelters and see how many people abuse animals . 
i own an animal shelter here in my home town . 
it must be so hard to deal with emotionally at times .  just watching a show makes me want to lash out . 
i try to pass that onto my top doctors to take care of the dogs . 
my daughter killed the gre!
that s great! i hope she goes to a good graduate school . 
thank you! me too :)
i am very happy for you!
 i m devastated by my mother s death
i am so sorry to hear that she has passed .   how long has she been gone?
   years _comma_  but i miss her every single day
i know how you feel .  
i have no luck when it comes to lottery tickets _comma_  i constantly buy losers . 
i have that same problem!
a friend of mine bought one right after i did one day   _comma_    mine was a loser   _comma_    his was a       _comma_       winner . 
holy goodness!!! i would be a bit jealous :(
a friend of mine was in a car accident
is your friend ok? what kind of car was it?
he was driving a compact and a truck hit him .   he didn t make it unfortunately
that is horrible news _comma_  i am so sorry for your loss . 
a co worker told me we were going to have a lot of work coming up
is that good or bad?  sometimes extra work can be a blessing  _comma_   unless you are salaried  _comma_   then it s just more work . 
bad if anything _comma_  i just hope it isn t overwhelming 
i hope so too .   what kind of work is it?
my father recently passed suddenly _comma_  i was devastated
oh _comma_  i am sorry for your loss
thank you .  i am having trouble getting over it . 
don t feel bad now .  what s done is done
yes _comma_  but i really miss him . 
i can understand .  i am really sorry
there was a   car accident this morning a driver going the wrong way it had traffic backed up . 
oh no! was anyone hurt?
yes one driver was in critical condition and car ran into the side of the express way it was unfortunate but i was over a hour late for work .  
that is so sad .  i hope they recover okay .  hopefully you weren t in trouble for being late either . 
i am excited to see my son and his fiance!
that is awesome _comma_  are they coming to visit you?
yes! in october .  i haven t seen him in a few months . 
awesome! i m not a father yet _comma_  but i can only imagine your kids growing up and leaving to live their own lives . 
yes _comma_  i do miss them .   but i am excited to see them get out there and leave their mark on the world . 
i didn t ask my husband if i could buy something _comma_  now he is mad and i feel bad . 
aw  _comma_   i m sorry  _comma_   did you just forget or you were thinking about other things?
i didn t think he would mind .   but it was expensive _comma_  so maybe i should have asked . 
yeah  _comma_   had a similar scuffle with my wife  _comma_   but being married sometimes you just have to forgive and forget . 
the bugs that creep me out the most is those eight legged spiders i seen a huge one in my car this weekend . 
i have never liked spiders . 
me either i screamed so loud lol i be afraid thy may crawl on me i would freak out .  
you should always have bug spray on you at all times . 
for now on i will . 
i hear something tapping outside my bathroom door .  i don t know what it is and i am really scared . 
that is really scary .  are you home alone?
yes! i don t have a gun or anything!
i m sure you are fine .  i bet it is just a tree branch or something like that .  maybe a neighbor could go look for you . 
i don t have any neighbors _comma_  and there are no trees there .  
i got a new position at my job more money and also happy to be recognized for my hard work .  
yay _comma_  a promotion is always amazing .   when do you start?
i actually started today it was a lot of information to take in but it was such a joy .  
thats amazing _comma_  financial stability can be a life changer . 
i hate going to walmart .  people just walk right out in front of you and don t even say excuse me!
maybe they re very eager to go a certain item . 
maybe .  it s that hunter gatherer mentality .   get it before everyone else . 
true _comma_  because regretfully i act that way sometimes too . 
i guess i might too . 
i love being lazy on weekends .  it s nice to just relax and have nothing to worry about . 
yeah i hear you! do you like to read or watch tv?
both! i spend more time watching tv though .  how about you?
i like to do both as well .  tv if i m feeling lazy _comma_  reading if i feel more ambitious .  
that s kind of how i am .  what kind of tv shows do you like?
i can be so forgetful i left my windows down in my car and my seats was full of water . 
oh no!! how did you dry them?
they are still air drying what makes it worse i sat in the sets and it looked like i wet myself lol a little embarrassing .  
oh that sounds awful! but at least no one stole anything from your car . 
i found a hair in my pizza _comma_  and now i can t eat
did you take it back that is so disgusting .  
i called them and told them about it .  they said the next pizza would be free .  i said no thanks . 
i wouldn t want another either it takes one time for me to find hair _comma_  bug etc and i am done with the restaurant .   
yes indeed .   i think i am done with eating out for a while
best way to ensure your food is clean and free of hair cook it yourself . 
i recently went on a long trip by car .  for the first time _comma_  it wasn t stressful because i packed everything i needed for it to run smoothly . 
that sounds great! i really pays off to be prepared .  
yes it does .  i was able to eliminate several meal breaks which cut over three hours off my trip time!
that sounds like some efficient planning! i hope you enjoy your trip!
thank you!
ever since my kids left and went to college i am such a loner . 
i can understand you .  but this is the cycle of life _comma_  right? kids grow and they have to find their own way of life in this world
yes you are right at least i have my cats to keep me company lol so i m not to much alone . 
good for you .  you can also call your friends to hang out if you have close ones
i didn t get to see my favorite character when i went to disney world . 
oh no _comma_  i m sorry .  did you stay long?
i was there for   days .   i wanted to see cinderella but i kept missing her . 
maybe she was around _comma_  but it wasn t time for the ball yet .

my girlfriend moved some of our mutual money without letting me know
sorry to hear that my friend .  was she facing an emergency?
not really .  i dont know what she used it for _comma_  she has not told anything to me so far
i know it sucks _comma_  but i think you should have an open conversation to your girl about this
im so mad! i can t find my hair brush!
that is a tragedy! where do you think you left it? did you check your pockets?
i have checked everywhere .   i think my dog may have snatched it . 
interesting .  i hope you do find it .  i don t know how you brush your hair . 
i am not brushing it _comma_  and it looks a mess .  
my husband has been texting a woman he works with
how does that make you feel?
very very bad _comma_  and suspicious . 
i am so sorry to hear you re going through this .  hopefully _comma_  it s nothing . 
hopefully .   i have not read the texts _comma_  but seen the name pop up . 
i want to see all the ingredients on the table before i start to cook

thats an awful thing to do! what did you do?
i gave him a punch right away .  thats no way to treat animals . 
i am so glad that you did 
i am sad that i won t be able to buy a new car .

oh wow that really sucks
we lost him   years ago to an accident
dang that is rough
i was so heartbroken when my dog died last month
that s so sad! did he at least die of old age?
he was hit by a truck .  i cant even imagine it
i m so sorry to hear that _comma_  may he rest in peace . 
i want to see all the ingredients neatly lined up on the table before i start cooking
is that because you just like being organized?
yes  _comma_   i want to be prepared all this time  _comma_   it is just the way i am
that is really a good way to be .  i need to practice this more _comma_  myself!
i am pretty comfy right now in my bed .  i feel very relaxed . 
bed is always a source of comfort for me .  especially _comma_  after work when i feel so drained and stressed out
yes that is the best time .   i like to come home  _comma_   fix some food  _comma_   and dive into my bed .   it is such a comfort . 
indeed .  particularly _comma_  when i grab my phone and watch short clips from my favorite tv shows on youtube
i was feeling so alone in florida when i moved there
aw i m sorry to hear .   did you conquer your loneliness?
i did .  i had gotten a new job there _comma_  and it was my first time being away from my family
i m glad you were able to adjust .   it can be lonely without family around . 
i am scared that i won t be able to get up tomorrow morning

i have to get up at   am _comma_  and it s already   .  
that sucks .  are you having trouble falling asleep?
i saw angeline jolie the other day

i saw her coming out of a restaurant .  she still looks so gorgeous _comma_  such a timeless beauty!
she is the most beautiful girl i have ever seen . 
i was so grossed out when a friend threw up on me
i dont blame you! i would have also!
we were at a party and he had too much whiskey inside him .  
nasty! did you tell him anything?
i was so mad when i found out our dogwalker used to torchur my dog
oh wow! i am so sorry that happened to you . 
thanks .  i fired her right then and there
i would have called the cops on her!
i once saw a man lift a car all by himself!
what type of car was it?
it was a fiat
that must have been a very big man . 
surprisingly he wasn t that big .  just powerful
i found     dollars in an old coat i had in storage!
thats so nice _comma_  love when that happens
yes it was definitely great _comma_  and couldn t have come at a better time .

i plan on going out and conquering the world! i feel like a million bucks . 
i want some of whatever you had for breakfast .  you seem very happy . 
i am frightened that i will lose my job . 
sorry to hear that! why do you think that might happen?
they have been laying people off _comma_  and the last person started a week after i didn
hopefully that doesn t happen _comma_  and you have job security . 
i sat in something wet and didn t know it .  walked around all day with a wet rear . 
that s pretty embarrassing haha .  ever find out what it was?
i still don t know .  i m sure it was pop or coffee . 
that would make sense _comma_  though you could probably have smelt it if it was coffee . 
i am so upset! my phone was on top of my car and it fell off and shattered
oh damn that s so sad .  was it salvageable? 
nope _comma_  completely destroyed .  i will have to buy a new one .  so inconvenient . 
it definitely sounds that way _comma_  gonna upgrade it?
my son had his wisdom teeth removed _comma_  and i took the opportunity to baby him a bit .  he is   
oh yea i had those out   years ago it sucks
yes he was pretty pitiful .   funny at first _comma_  but then he started hurting .  i felt bad for him . 
yea it can be sore and you cant eat anything
i wish i could see my father one more time
im glad i still have mine around . 
spend as much time as you can with him .  you never know when you won t be able to anymore . 
exactly what i do .  we were never close growig up .  we are now . 
i miss watching chiller theatre with my family on fridays

we had record rainfall in my town this past spring causing a lot of flooding . 
oh no .  floodwaters can be devastating .  was there a lot of damage?
yes  _comma_   there was  _comma_   the town was very damaged .  we had sandbagged around our home and managed to save our house . 
good thing you were prepared . 
i got into a argument with a coworker of mine this past month . 
did yall make up
no _comma_   he had taken credit for my work with our boss . 
that is not good
i had a big fishing trip planned for this past weekend _comma_  but it got rained out . 
will you get to make it up?
doesn t seem like it .  my job makes it very difficult to schedule time off . 
i am sure you will find time
a friend of mine got to try out for a professional baseball team . 
oh wow _comma_  how did he do
he made their minor league team  _comma_   and if he does well  _comma_   maybe the pro team . 
that is so cool
last week i had a big presentation at work _comma_  which i knew i was going to do well on . 
that sounds like something that could really show off your talents . 
i sure did  _comma_   i had spent weeks learning the material  _comma_   and really impressed my boss . 
that s great! hope your hard work pays off . 
i went to comic con this year .  i felt like i was a child all over again
how expensive is that to go to?
depends on where you live .  i spent      bucks on it
that is not too bad if you had a good time though
i felt so alone after my dog trevor passed last year
the loss of a pet is heartbreaking .  i know how you feel .  how old was trevor . 
he was   .  his time hadn t come _comma_  but i guess life is that way sometimes . 
life is hard .  but remember he didn t die he went to his forever home . 
i was feeling so lonely in miami after i moved there
sorry to hear that .   have you since been able to overcome your loneliness?
i think so .  i have made some friends .  it was my first time being away from family
i understand feeling like a duck out of the pond .   glad to hear you ve made progress . 
i feel so nervous about my upcoming job interview
don t feel nervous _comma_  you need to be confident!
i know .  but i have this feeling inside me that i would screw up
it s hard to push that feeling away sometimes _comma_  i know . 
i am so hyped about lebron  joining the lakers!
that s exciting! i m guessing you re a lakers fan?
yeah i am! we finally have something that unite and rally us behind our team for a season
what team was he on before?
i am feeling so nervous about my dad getting his heart checked tomorrow
i understand that _comma_  i will pray for you
thank you so much .  i am just hoping not to get any bad news
that makes sense _comma_  i wish you both the best of luck and health!
when i look at my son doing great in studies _comma_  it makes me so proud!
how old is he?
he is    .  he has been a straight a student always . 
wow  _comma_   great job so far  _comma_   kep up the great parenting!
i went to watch the annabelle movie in the theatres .  it was a terrifying experience
wasn t that out a long time ago? it must ve been super scary if you still remember it . 
yeah  _comma_   it has been a while .  i went at night  _comma_   alone .  so you can imagine the impact!
wow _comma_  i wouldn t have been brave enough to do that!
i always feel a bit of jealousy when i see someone driving around in a red sports car
yes _comma_  it is hard to see people with things you can t afford to buy for yourself . 
i feel that way about red sports car only though .  i have always dreamed of owning one as a kid . 
yes _comma_  i like the color red as well .  i have actually own a couple red sports cars . 
i just took the last of my college finals and i stayed up all night studying the material . 
it is great to be thorough and prepared .  are you expecting to perform well?
i know i did well _comma_  i had the material all memorized and knew the answers to all the questions . 
thats nice _comma_  i wish you the very best for your results!
i was super irritated when my boss kept pulling my hair for fun!
i can see why! that s highly inappropriate .   
he seems to think otherwise for some reason .  i am thinking about reporting him to the hr . 
you should .  he is obviously at the very least flirting with you and at worst harassing you
i am going out to dinner with my wife to a place we haven t been to since i proposed to her .  i cant wait . 
oh wow _comma_  that is going to be such a sweet experience!
i hope so .  it ended up being the best restaurant we ever went to and it will be nice to rekindle out early romance . 
that is very true .  i sincerely wish you both to have a wonderful time!
thank you _comma_  we plan on it . 
i always feel down and blue when memories of my mom come in my mind .  she passed when i was   
i m so sorry to hear that .  do you have things of hers that remind you of her often? 
yeah .  i have kept a collection of her things _comma_  just so that she always stays in my life . 
that is beautiful that you have those things of hers .  mothers are very special people . 
i was so excited to go to flower & garden festival at epcot this year .  i couldn t wait to try all the food and see the beautiful gardening . 
i have been to that _comma_  it is such a wonderful experience .  you are going to love it!
i absolutely love going to disney and the festivals at epcot are such a great experience each time .  we go to food & wine each year and the seminars are my favorite part! it s so exciting!
you seem to have a great taste in spending your free time .  i wish you get to have a splendid time in there!
i was heartbroken when my dog trevor died last month . 
i m sorry to hear about that .  how did he die?
he was ran over by a truck .  i can t even try to imagine that
yeah i bet .  im sorry for your loss
i hurt my back and can t mow the grass so it s getting long and everyone elses lawn look so nice .  it s embarrassing .  
how did you hurt your back?
i really don t know .  i woke up at it was tight then it just kept getting worse as day went on .  its been a week now . 
ohh wow! i hope it gets better for you
me too .  my lawn looks horrible and people are starting to think i don t take care of my home i bet . 
a friend of mine borrowed my mower this past weekend _comma_  which he brought back broken . 
did you ask him to replace it?
he said it wasn t his fault and it just stopped working .  of course the blade is bent _comma_  so i think he might be lying . 
i agree with you there _comma_  i would ask him to pay honestly
my local animal shelter donated a dog to me because of my service connected disability .  it was such a nice surprise 
that s nice .  how  do you like the dog?
he is my best friend and i think he needs me as much as i need him . 
that is so sweet .  my apartments don t allow pets
i love when i go somewhere and for some reason or another it reminds me of my childhood .  it makes me feel so good . 
that is for sure _comma_  especially a smell that just throws you back
omg yes! sometimes it s a sound or just a feeling you get for no reason .  it s like comfort food  . lol
exactly  _comma_   sometimes i just smell a good barbeque and that brings me back to those summer days as a kid  _comma_   life is great sometimes
i was suppose to go on vacation with my family last month _comma_  but i caught the flu and couldn t go . 
that stinks .  im sorry to hear that
yeah _comma_  i was looking forward to sitting on the beach and relaxing . 
i bet! it seems like fun
i am celebrating me and my wife s   year anniversary tomorrow and i m excited about it . 
congratulations .  fun plans?
just going out to dinner and then a romantic night at the beach . 
awww .  i m jealous lol
years ago when we moved into our home _comma_  we found a young kitten that had been abandoned . 
awww .  did you keep it?
yes  _comma_   we did .  he was so cute we took him in  _comma_   and now he is   years old . 
thats great .  i know he appreciates it
i feel very ready for my college exam . 
that s great .  i hope you do well!
thank you .  i think it will be easy!
good luck!
my rabbit died last year _comma_  i miss her to this day
how old was it
i had her for about    years .  
they live that long ? interesting
yeah _comma_  they can live to about    years if you take care of them right
so i asked my boss for a raise today . 
how d that go?
it went well _comma_  i m pretty sure that i ll get it!
well congratulations! that must have been nerve wracking . 
so my neighbor just bought a new car .  i swear _comma_  he always gets really expensive stuff to show off how successful he is . 
that stinks .  maybe he is going through something that only new stuff can solve
maybe .  but still .  now i feel like i need to buy one myself . 
do it! i bet you deserve it
last year my wife got into an accident and we only had one car and i was so worried we wouldn t have a car to get to work
did you make special arrangements so things went smoothly with one car?
we didn t have many options but the other persons insurance ended up taking care of it all so we got a rental and the car got fixed but i was so scared  . 
well i am glad it worked out
last night i found something in my son s room that made me so mad!
what did you find?!
drugs! i found drugs .  i can t believe this . 
oh no _comma_  are you going to talk to him about the dangers of drugs?
i definitely will .  i bet he ll say that they aren t his _comma_  but i know better . 
do you remember that show i was telling you about the other day? it s getting a new season!
remind me _comma_  which show was that?
the one with the three cops that can never agree with each other but end up solving the cases anyway .  i m so happy about this news!
that s so cool!  i m gonna have to check it out
i was going through some boxes today _comma_  and i found a really old picture of me with my grandmother . 
that s nice .  are you going to hang it up?
yeah _comma_  definitely .  it brings back really good memories . 
great _comma_  you ve found an old treasure . 
my girlfriend broke up with me recently . 
i m sorry .  how long had you been together?
we were together for   years .  i can t stand being alone . 
just try and get through each day _comma_  one at a time .  don t think too far ahead . 
i keep hearing noises coming from my basement . 
that sounds scary .   are you going to investigate?
i want to  _comma_   but i m a bit scared .  maybe i should take something with me to defend myself  _comma_   just in case . 
if this were a movie _comma_  i d be yelling at the screen for you to leave the house and not go down there . 
i can t believe this! my son failed a really important test . 
i am so sorry to hear that .   is he planning to retake the test?
i sure hope so .  otherwise he might not be able to graduate . 
what test?
it was a math test _comma_  it makes up a pretty large part of his grade . 
they other day was my son s first day of school _comma_  and when i dropped him off it brought back so much memories . 
that s great .  is that your only son?
yes _comma_  he s my only son .  i cant wait until he get s his first girlfriend like i did in middle school .  those were the days . 
i m sure the memories will be great
so i ve been walking around all day with a huge hole in the back of my pants .  i just found out about it . 
oh wow! hopefully no one saw it
if they did _comma_  no one told me about it! so embarrassing . 
im sorry about that .  ive gone through that before .  laughter can be good medicine sometimes
so that new game that i ve been looking forward to is coming out in a few weeks!
what is it called ?
oh  _comma_   i m sure it s not one that you ve heard of .  i m pretty excited though  _comma_   i ve been saving up money for it for a few months now . 
okay _comma_  well i guess i m happy for you then . 
yesterday _comma_  i caught my neighbor letting his dog poop on my lawn .  i had a few choice words for him . 
that s understandable .   how receptive was he to your complaint?
he wasn t to happy about me confronting him .  i told him if it happens again it might get physical . 
oh _comma_  so it got pretty serious .   i guess he needs to learn to respect boundaries . 
i was going through some boxes in my attic today . 
did you find anything?
yeah _comma_  i found some old toys from my childhood .  so many memories came flooding back into my mind . 
i bet that was very nostalgic for you . 
i can t believe that my coworker got the promotion that i was going for .  this is ridiculous . 
that s a hard hit to take .   why do you suspect they got it?
i honestly have no idea .  i was definitely more deserving of that position . 
so what are you going to do about?  are you going to start looking for another place to work?
i really think that i might . 
i m so ashamed of myself .  i made a big mistake on a project for work . 
what did you mess up?
it was something for an important client .  now i m afraid this is going to screw up my career . 
i m sure you ll be fine .   have you made many similar mistakes in the past?
no _comma_  this is the first time i ve messed up anything like this . 
i wouldn t worry too much about it then .   don t let it get you down . 
i bought a used car a few years ago and found     dollars tucked in the back seat!
wow _comma_  that s nice .  i hope you treated yourself to something extravagant!
oh i spent it on a few things .  i was just surprised someone didn t find it when it was being cleaned . 
i guess they didn t do as good a job as they should have _comma_  lol .  wish my car dealership had missed a few hundred bucks!
i know! made it not so bad that the car i traded in was a junker and not worth much lol
well _comma_  it was worth     ! that s about what my car s worth these days   had it for years .  still runs great tho  . 
i m going camping with my kids this weekend . 
how fun! in a tent or an rv?
in a tent .  i just have to make extra sure that i pack all of the supplies that we ll need . 
don t forget a first aid kit! we always need those on camping trips!
on my way home today there was someone in the fast lane going so slow in front of me . 
ugh _comma_  that s so annoying .   how long did you have to follow behind them?
about   miles .  there was too much trafic in the slow lane _comma_  couldn t get over
i hope you weren t late for anything important!
i was watching television earlier today when i came across a channel that was showing a bunch of cartoons that i loved when i was younger . 
memory lane right there! which cartoons? 
it was a whole bunch of different ones from the    s .  man _comma_  they really reminded me of my childhood . 
very cool i havent seen the older style cartoons myself in years . 
i keep getting strange phone calls .  it s creeping me out . 
that would creep me out too what kind of calls?? 
the person on the other end just keeps making really weird sounds until i hang up .  i m not sure what i should do about it . 
alright that would creep me out too .  block the number or change yours!! weird .  
my boyfriend told me he quit drinking _comma_  but i just found a bunch of empty liquor bottles he hid in his room . 
uh oh .  are you going to confront him about it?
absolutely _comma_  but it probably won t go well .  he needs help but he won t accept it . 
well i hope that he actually listens to you this time and gets help . 
yay! i m finally getting a promotion at work!
congratulations _comma_  that s awesome! i hope you re getting a raise too!
yeah  _comma_   a raise will definitely come with it .  i ve put a lot of work into this  _comma_   and it finally paid off!
hope you treat yourself to celebrate _comma_  you deserve it!
so i might be up for a promotion soon at work!
that sounds amazing! when will you find out? 
soon .  there are several other people trying to get the same position _comma_  but i m pretty hopeful that things will work out in my favor . 
you sound positive so i am sure you will get it!!! 
we went to get gas one night and my husband and an altercation with some guy _comma_  guy pulledoutabig knife in the storeand by our car at the gas station . 
omg _comma_  that s so scary! are you okay? did you call the police?
yes we called the police he was arrested! 
that s good to hear! people are crazy
really crazy had to go to court _comma_  he lied so much 
i envy my friend who is off work today
i bet .   it is nice to have a day off every now and then
it definitely is
i like having days off to do absolutly nothing .   it helps with stress . 
ugh _comma_  my cat keeps climbing up the curtains in my room . 
that s the worst .   is it damaging the curtains too much?
yeah _comma_  he s tearing them up .  i really wish he d stop . 
is there anything you can put on them or near them to stop him?
i m not sure _comma_  but i m going to try to find something that will do that . 
we ve decided to adopt another cat from the shelter!
that is great! adopt _comma_  don t shop! always a great motto!
agreed  _comma_   that s my motto! this is a high kill shelter too  _comma_   so we ll definitely be saving a life :)
that is great _comma_  i commend you!
i am nervous for a meeting i have later
have you prepared enough for it?
yeah i believe so
well im sure you be fine .  just relax . 
im happy with my health for the first time in a few years
that s good to hear! have you been eating healthy?
yes definitely _comma_  and getting plenty of exercise 
that s great! keep up the good work!
i bought some new food for my dog _comma_  and he refuses to eat it . 
thats strange _comma_  my dog will eat anything lol
yeah  _comma_   that s what i thought about mine too .  i bought a huge bag of the stuff  _comma_   too .  it s so irritating . 
maybe he will start warming up to it soon
i certainly hope so . 
my coworker gave a really nice presentation at work today . 
about what?!
oh it was just boring work stuff _comma_  about a client .  but i was really awed by the amount of work that she put into it . 
that s awesome .  i m glad she did well . 
i ve been working hard and doing a great job for several months _comma_  but still no raise . 
thats always a bummer when you put in such work and get nothing in return 
yeah _comma_  especially when my boss promised to pay me more .  might be time to quit!
oh i just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually! never been happier! 
im nervous about taking a test soon
did you study for it or are you winging it?
i feel pretty prepared
don t worry then .   you did you part!! i m sure you will do fine!
my roommate is gone for the week _comma_  on a business trip .  it s way too quiet around here . 
maybe you should try and have a party?
that s a good idea .  i can t stand being alone in this place much longer . 
yes being alone is not very fun . 
my birthday is coming up next week .  i m really looking forward to it . 
what will your new age be?
i ll be turning    .  and some friends are coming that i haven t seen in years _comma_  it ll be great to see them again . 
you should have a great time _comma_  congrats on the new age!
my wife and i got a divorce .  the house is so quiet without her and the kids being here . 
i went through a similar thing a few years back .   everything seemed hollow to me .   how long has it been?
about two years now and everything still seems very odd to me . 
if your depressed  _comma_   speak to someone .   if it s just adjusting to the change  _comma_   that comes in time . 
uh oh .  i m in trouble now . 
why is it that you are in trouble?
i lost a really important document at work .  telling my boss is going to be so embarrassing . 
can you just replace the document?
if only it were that easy .  it had several signatures on it . 
there s a creepy guy that comes by at work that won t stop bothering me .  he writes crazy letters _comma_  and keeps calling on the phone  just to chat  with me . 
i would be reporting that to the police for sure .  
i tried .  they said they can t do anything unless he actually tries to physically harm me _comma_  which is insane to me . 
thats true right .  i forgot how stupid the law can be sometimes .  thats insane .  
my father was diagnosed with stage   brain cancer . 
oh no! i am so sorry to hear that .  that must be very difficult for you and your family . 
yes it was .  it only took a few short months and my father passed away due to it being inoperable . 
i am so sorry for your loss .  i hope that you find peace in this difficult time . 
i m starting a new job next week! can t wait to be doing something different for a change!
that s great .  what will you be doing at your new job?
thanks! graphic design mostly .  at my old job i was a manager and it was horrible . 
sometimes being a manager is the worst job you can have at a place _comma_  you seem to be the one who gets blamed for everything . 
recently _comma_  i got passed over for a promotion at my job . 
aw man _comma_  that sucks .  promotions usually aren t given fairly in my experience .  was that the case for you too?
no  _comma_   the guy that got it was qualified  _comma_   it s just i really wanted the job .  it would have really help my career . 
i ll keep my fingers crossed for you that you get that promotion next time!
i bought a scratch off lottery ticket the other day _comma_  and won       . 
that is amazingly lucky! good for you!
i almost passed out _comma_  i have never won so much money before . 
that is great! i wish i was lucky like that!
had to take my cat to the vet .  he s got a bad injury on his paw and it hasn t been healing . 
awh poor baby .  i am sure itll get better now tho! how old is he? 
he s   years old .  they re going to have to put him down   turns out he has feline aids :(
ugh noooo! thats terrible i am so sorry .  :( 
one of my art pieces has been chosen to be put in a exhibition!
i would be so excited! did they pay you for it? 
haven t been paid for it yet _comma_  but people that visit are welcome to put in an offer for anything they see! fingers crossed someone wants mine!
hopefully! that would be so amazing! 
i was enjoying the morning watching the kids play in the pool . 
that sounds like such a fun  _comma_   peaceful morning .  so jealous you have a pool  _comma_   it s been scorching outside!
well it s only a kiddie pool _comma_  kids are very little .  it was a very nice morning . 
ah okay  _comma_   nice for the kiddos then .  they grow up fast  _comma_   so hold onto these moments while you can:)
as a child _comma_  i was mean to my sister all the time and i still feel awful about it . 
aw _comma_  well when your younger you don t do those things on purpose .  i think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then . 
true  _comma_   but she s very sensitive .  i m sure it still bothers her .  i try to make up for it today  _comma_   but i never can take those things back . 
have you talked to her about it? maybe she doesn t really think about it anymore . 
my husband and i lostour daughter  years ago and i don t care to celebrate mother s day and he still impressed me with a gift
i am so sorry to hear about your loss .  what did he get you?
he got my favorite flower _comma_  an orchid a card and made dinner 
that was very nice of him .  i m glad you have a nice husband . 
thanks
went to get an oil change the other day .  turns out i didn t need one for another    _comma_      miles  _comma_   and i felt like such a fool . 
well better to be sooner than later on something like that .  dont be hard on yourself .  
agreed _comma_  and it had been   months so i figured i was due .  the mechanic was really condescending which was what made it embarrassing!
thats so silly its none of his worry .  he needs to hush up .  lol 
my cat somehow managed to lock himself in the bathroom last night .  i still can t figure out how he did it . 
wow! he sounds like a super smart cat! how did you get him out of there?
he is! well _comma_  both smart and dumb haha .  had to use a knitting needle to pick the lock!
well at least you managed to save him!
i ve got a coworker with zero social skills _comma_  and it s driving me batty .  she can t seem to tell no one wants to listen to her talk for    minutes straight . 
oh man _comma_  i ve definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before .  what does she even talk about?
if you make a comment on anything  _comma_   say cats  _comma_   she ll go into a monologue about everything she s ever learned about a cat (most of it wrong) . 
that s the worst! some people  _comma_   once they get started  _comma_   they just can t stop themselves .  it s like opening a can of pringles . 
we had an annoying client the other day _comma_  and i went to the breakroom to complain about her to my coworkers (thinking she couldn t hear) . 
did it feel good to get it out?
it did at first _comma_  until i left the room and saw she was sitting right by the door where she could hear everything! it was humiliating and i felt really bad for her after that . 
oh no _comma_  that s awkward! did you get in trouble for it?
i found some baby kittens in my yard _comma_  their mother was dead .  i nursed them to health and found homes for them . 
that s heartbreaking _comma_  but you re amazing for doing that .  cats are my favorite and i ve rescued many animals .  it s a lot of work . 
they are my favorite _comma_  too .  i love how independent they are . 
yes  _comma_   and when they love you it feels special  _comma_   because they don t love everyone like dogs do .  you ve racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!
finances aren t great right now .  i ve got a lot of bills that are overdue _comma_  but i can t afford to pay them :(
i m there too .  struggling each day .  it really gets old . 
i m sorry we re both in this situation .  it really sucks _comma_  and it feels unfair because it s not for lack of effort . 
yeah  _comma_   that s right .  i ve been pushing    hours working a week for as long as i can remember .  hold out  _comma_   maybe it ll change . 
i was out of school for over a year and thought i forgot everything before taking this big test
you would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break!
i know it was nerve wrecking but studying all the time and i mean al the time paid off 
im glad it paid off for you _comma_  you must be super proud!
a few years back i got laid off from my job because they were losing too much money .  it broke me _comma_  i really loved that job . 
oh no _comma_  i am so sorry .  what did you do?
to be honest _comma_  i fell into a pretty deep depression .  no one wanted to hire me .  it was tough . 
that is tough .  that must have been quite the trying time .  did you eventually find work?
i did  _comma_   yeah .  and strangely enough  _comma_   the company hired me back a few years later when they were doing better cashflow wise .  
im stoked to go see some old friends tomorrow night
good _comma_  how long has it been since you saw them last?
about a year and a half!
i hope you all have some fun . 
i m so ready for fall   it s been incredibly hot all summer _comma_  and i need my favorite season to hurry up & get here!
oh yes _comma_  fall is definitely my favorite season as well! i love fall scents!
me too! wearing comfy sweaters  _comma_   snuggling up with a hot drink  _comma_   and fall smell on the air . can t wait for it!
it is the best season  _comma_   by far! plus  _comma_   halloween!
a bunch of fruit flies appeared in my apartment out of nowhere the other day .  i think it s because of some old veggies in my fridge .  totally gross . 
oh man  _comma_   those things are awful and reproduce like crazy .   we left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! the best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar  _comma_   a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it .   they will gravitate toward it and you ll catch a bunch! just keep changing it every few days . 
thanks for the tip _comma_  i will try that! i cleaned out the fridge and most of them seemed to just go away .  i have no idea where they go but don t really care either as long as they re gone!
seriously _comma_  gone is good .   they do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all .  glad you re free of them!
i m getting married next year! hoping everything goes smoothly and we get the wedding we want to have . 
that is so exciting! it can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding . 
boy are you right about that .  i was really excited during the early planning stages _comma_  but it s been stressful ever since . 
it really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute .  you are always so worried you are going to forget something . 
my friends went ahead and gave me a baby shower that i didn t know about . 
oh that was nice of them
yeah _comma_  they had told my husband about it so he could get me there . 
haha thats pretty fun
i have an adorable hamster that doesn t look like he s doing well .  he is on the old side for hamsters _comma_  and i m worried he won t live much longer . 
oh no _comma_  i am sorry to hear that .  i hope that he gets to feeling better .  how old is he?
thank you  _comma_   me too! he s a little over   years old .  i d hate to lose him  _comma_   but they usually don t live more than     years . 
oh i see _comma_  i can understand your concern .  perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!
i went back to work for my former company recently .  they laid me off a few years ago when things were tough .  coming back was a little scary but i was thrilled!
that is awesome!  i would be really excited if i were in yyour shoes!
yes _comma_  that s exactly how i felt .  i suspected they d been in trouble for a while so when they asked me to come back and help them out it felt really good . 
i hope you go far in your job!  good luck!
thank you!
im upset that my neighbor s dog is sick
that is quite upsetting .  do you know what ails it?
no they are at the vet now
well i certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better .  are you close friends with this canine companion?
well i had spent the good part of a week organising the best weekend away with my hubby for our   th wedding anniversary .  spa day  _comma_   great dinner  _comma_   concert and of course the parents were booked to mind the kids for the weekend .   however all did not go to plan . 
oh no _comma_  what happened? hopefully the whole weekend didn t get ruined!
well unfortunately the day before we were due to go my little   year old daughter woke up covered in spots .   as the day went on more and more appeared and she had a roaring temperature .   we realised she had chickenpox .   she was feeling so miserable and of course all she wanted was her mummy and daddy .   it was a bit depressing and part of me was devastated but our weekend away was not to be .   sure kids always come first dont they?!
poor little thing     _comma_      chicken pox are the worst .  on the bright side     _comma_      you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband     _comma_      just not     _comma_      you know     _comma_      in the way you hoped .  hope you guys get to have a make up weekend soon!
very true and thats the way to look at it .  i was a bit dispirited but the hotel were great and re arranged it for us and to be honest i could never have left my baby when she was poorly .  the best made plans dont always work out when you have kids _comma_  but hey i wouldnt change them for the world . 
my neighbor has a brand new tesla and every time i look at it i get so envious .  i know it s stupid _comma_  i should be happy for him that he has such a cool car . 
wow thats nice .   what do you drive?
well that s the thing  _comma_   i don t .  i bike everywhere .  don t get me wrong  _comma_   i love my bike and it s a great way to stay fit .  
you have to think of the positives .   just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great .   they could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are . 
that is a really good way to put it _comma_  i will definitely keep that in mind next time i find myself pining after his car . 
lol and some day you might you buy your own new tesla _comma_  if you feel like it!
a tesla with a bike rack!
exactly!
i m happy my package just arrived
oh thats nice
im glad it came earlier
yea i would be to
i m feeling nostalgic today
why s that?
i found some old keepsakes in the basement ealier
nostalgia is a weird feeling . 
i ve got a fun weekend coming up _comma_  and i m really looking forward to it!
nice _comma_  what do you have planned?
going to the drive in   _comma_    out to eat   _comma_    and probably minigolf .  nothing particularly special   _comma_    just haven t had fun in awhile!
sound great _comma_  i m happy for you!
i recently had a project of mine recognized in a national publication!
wow!  that must feel great!  you should be proud of this accomplishment .   people can go their whole lives without ever being published!
it felt amazing to be recognized for my work _comma_  and in a publication i respect to boot! 
congratulations!  i wish i could be published . 
well i certainly wasn t expecting it so who knows _comma_  maybe one day you will!
i am going to disney next year .  i want to write a list of everything to bring . 
what are some things you will bring?
i m not really sure .  i think if i write things out that i could possibly need i won t forget anything . 
it s a good idea to write thing down that you might forget . 
things have been rough for me lately _comma_  but thankfully i ve got family and a fiance that are helping me through it . 
what is wrong? are you okay?
i m in a lot of debt thanks to my car needing expensive repairs _comma_  and haven t been able to afford it .  it s pretty depressing not being able to pay your bills : 
i am so sorry .  i hope you get all the help you need . 
the rain today is frustrating
we have been getting a lot of rain as well .  i have to mow my lawn so much . 
im not a fan of it at all
yeah i know what you mean .  i can t wait for the rainy season to end . 
the other day i was riding my bike and this woman ran a stop sign _comma_  nearly hitting me .  thank goodness i was paying attention and was able to stop in time . 
oh my goodness _comma_  i ve almost gotten hit while on a bike before and it s terrifying .  i m so glad you re alright!
i wish people would pay more attention .  i try to do my best to follow the rules of the road both when i m on my bike and in a car . 
ditto .  it s not hard to do _comma_  and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules .  i ll send good vibes out so nothing bad happens to you in the future!
thank you _comma_  i appreciate that!
my boyfriend proposed to me _comma_  and i accepted! i thought he didn t want to get married so it was a welcome surprise . 
wow _comma_  congratulations! have you guys set a date yet?
thank you! we re hoping to get married sometime next year _comma_  but man weddings are expensive .  it may be further off than i d like!
oh i feel you _comma_  i used to work in the wedding industry .  it s crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding . 
i just had my birthday and i ate way too much .  had a good time _comma_  but boy do i feel bad for all of that food .  i m supposed to be eating healthier!
i know exactly how that happens .  sometimes the food is just too good to pass up . 
no kidding .  had free refills on a root beer float too _comma_  and how could i say no to that?
well i say go for it .  it is only your birthday once a year .  the other     days can make up for it . 
i am pleased with the day im having today
glad to hear you are having a good day .  wish every day was like that . 
me too but we wouldnt appreciate the good days if it werent for the bad
that is true .  it puts things in context . 
every night before bed _comma_  we read the bible to our son .  i love when he relates what he learned to real life . 
that is really awesome! that is so important to be involved in his life like that .  
it is .  and shows that he is listening .  
it does! kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook .  
our mail carrier keeps leaving packages outside instead of putting them in the lobby . 
that is frustrating _comma_  especially if the weather isnt ideal 
exactly! it rained the other day and my package was totally ruined . 
that is unfortunate _comma_  im sorry that happened!
thank you! at least i was able to get it replaced . 
my friend left my front door open when she was house sitting for me .  my cat snuck out and was killed . 
that isn t good .  are you mad at your friend?
i was really upset at the time but once i had some time i realized it was an honest mistake .  she felt really bad about it . 
are you going to get another cat?
when i m ready _comma_  i think yes . 
i can t wait for it to be christmas already .  just thinking about that time of year makes me really happy . 
i feel the same way as well!  i get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts!
exactly! and the food _comma_  and friends .  all of it is just so lovely . 
i agree!  everything that surrounds christmas makes me smile and feel content .   it makes me thankful for everything good in life!
each day waking up i can t believe how lucky am i just to be alive . 
that s a great outlook i think .  we often lose focus of that very important fact . 
yes _comma_  i don t need anything .  i have something to eat and a roof over my head .  i really can t ask for anything more . 
that s inspiring to me .  i will try to think more like that as well whenever i get stressed in life . 
i went running for the first time in months .  i could not believe it .  i was able to run a full   miles with out taking a break . 
  miles!? that s very impressive .   i bet i could barely make it a mile!
yes _comma_  my first time out in    days .  i impressed my self . 
have you been a long time runner before that?
not really .  a few years ago i got tired of being fat so one day i just went out and started running .  two months ago i stopped due to hurting my back surfing .  i got the all clear yesterday and went back out . 
just gave my wife access to my credit card .  i m worried but excited i can trust her .  do you ever have issues trusting people?
i can relate to that!  yeah  _comma_   my wife with my credit card  _comma_   lol!
it s taken me    years to get to this point .  last time i let her have at it .  she bought us a trip to mexico on my credit card . 
haha _comma_  i can understand the hesitation then .   but was the vacation at least worth the money?
it was fun .  adults only resort  _comma_   all inclusive  _comma_   private swimming pool off the room but cost     a day . 
 i ve been at my current job   years .  i m at the point i can go into upper management but i m afraid .  maybe i m just comfortable now .  i don t know .  
that s something that takes a lot of contemplation _comma_  because it s such a big decision to make .  will the extra money be worth the extra work?
an extra   k a year but it would be highly stressful .  currently i have the highest ratings in the usa _comma_  i m sure any new employer would want me to bring them up to that stage as well .  
oh wow _comma_  an additional   k is a lot! i d be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large . 
i currently work    hours a week .  i d be working around       a week then . 
oh wow .  i ll be honest and say it wouldn t be worth it for me! what s an extra   k if you re never not at work to enjoy it?
i took my wife surfing for the first time today .  within an hour she was riding waves _comma_  color me impressed!
oh wow _comma_  i think it d take me much longer to not bust my butt! that is impressive!
yes _comma_   i was surprised .  i ve been at it my entire life and never seen anyone pick it up so quickly .  she is not even athletic . 
maybe she s more athletic than you think! she might be better than you soon .  better watch out!
a friend of mine bought a new car
awesome! what kind?
tesla _comma_  i ve had my eye on the model for some time
oh man those are super nice! all electric is pretty neat
a friend of mine got a new high paying job
that s good on his part _comma_  how do you feel about it?
i thought it was amazing he got it _comma_  seemed like a tough job to land
that s awesome  _comma_   and i agree  _comma_   the job market is tough now a days .   high paying or not . 
a co worker of mine was late delivering materials for a project
oh that s no good .  any special reason why they were late?
the guy just doesn t seem to care
that s a bad attitude to have .  i hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there . 
going to the doctor for the first time since      tomorrow .  i m dreading telling the doctor how long it has been since my last visit .  
it will be okay .  it s always hard making that step _comma_  but it s good for your health to do it . 
i m only going because my insurance gives me a gift card for going .  i m in perfect health .  but still ashamed . 
i wish my insurance would give me something like that! it s good to go anyways . 
im scared of this big test tomorrow
have you studied for it?  always helps to prepare!
yes i have _comma_  still nervous though
good luck _comma_  i m sure you will do fine!
my wife and i are on a diet together for the last month .  we have been doing great but today on my way home from work i stopped for ice cream and did not tell her . 
hey everyone trips up a little .  what you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that .  
yea i know .  the real issues is that i want to stop again from more tomorrow .  
it s ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while _comma_  but you can t give in .  be strong!
i just turned in my dissertation .  i m scared it will not pass and all my work toward my masters will be for nothing . 
you only get to do it once?
yes _comma_  you turn it in then go in front of a board of people .  in my case    people .  if they don t like it i can t go one to work on my phd and will need to write another .  this one has taken   years to write . 
oh no .  i hope it goes well for you .  that s a lot of hard work . 
i finally got a raise at my job
congrats!
i was pretty happy _comma_  it was long overdue
was it more than expected?
the other day i was drinking and sent an email i shouldn t have .  i felt so stupid when i woke up and realized what i d done . 
that has happened to me _comma_  but with texts though lol
yeah i ve done that _comma_  too .  the funny thing is i m usually pretty eloquent even when i m drunk so i don t think the recipient even realized i was drunk when i wrote it . 
did you apologize?
no _comma_  when they responded i just played it off like i meant to send it .  everything turned out fine!
lol
my car has been having issues lately
what s wrong with it?
engine issues i think _comma_  not sure if the car will make it
can you fix it?
got on the scale today .  i ve only been on a diet   weeks and i m down    pounds . 
that is great news .  have you also been working out?
not really .  i average    miles a day walking at work but did that when i was fat as well .  i cut out all processed foods and drinks . 
has it been easy or hard to do that?
rough .  i used to like iced tea and now only drink black coffee or water .  i miss flavor .  plus it s a lot of work cooking everything . 
i took some candy a friend left out
did they notice it was missing?
not yet _comma_  i plan on compensating my friend for what i took
well at least you are attempting to be honest about it . 
i just realized today i have not been home to where my family is from in a little over    years . 
ohh wow! are you excited?
no i m not going .  i don t have time and my family dose not talk to me .  i just miss home . 
ohh that stinks .  i dont blame you though
the other day this creepy guy followed me around the store and chased me out to the parking lot .  he just wouldn t take a hint . 
that s very creepy _comma_  did he say anything to you?
yeah that s what made it weird _comma_  it was kind of like he was trying to hit on me but just awkward .  but he was really pushy about it . 
those are definitely the scary types _comma_  they don t recognize social cues at all . 
i hope that s all it was and not that he had some bad motive . 
a close friend said she was having problems with her knee
ouch!  did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing? i hope she can find help with physical therapy . 
hopefully she will see a doctor soon about it
oh good .   hopefully she ll try to fix it with physical therapy first .   some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary .   recommend that she get a second opinion .   hope she resolves it!
a co worker stole my lunch
i ve never understood that _comma_  it s not like they can t afford to eat since they have a job! do you know which coworker it was?
not entirely sure _comma_  i marked my lunch so they knew it wasn t theirs
next time bring your lunch in a biohazard bag _comma_  maybe they will leave it alone . 
a friend of mine revealed a deep dark secret i told her in confidence to everyone .  
what did you do?
i blocked her and sent her a long text explaining how angry and disappointed i was .  i didn t know what else to do . 
you definitely can t be too careful these days
you re right .  it makes me less likely to trust others in the future . 
every single time i go in the office bathroom someone comes in and needs something .  if i don t go to the bathroom no one comes in all day . 
how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?
because i work in the same little office alone all day .  today i did not use the bathroom no one came in .  yesterday i went twice and each time i went i had someone waiting on me when i got back to my desk . 
ok
i discovered my cat peed on my bath mat when i got out of the shower today and the mat was wet . 
oh no! that stinks .  i ve never had a cat specifically because i ve never been good with the idea of being able to train them .  plus it seems like you just get the one personality _comma_  and they never grow to like you .  but i m biased . 
it s funny you say that  _comma_   i actually like that about cats .  they are independent and not too needy  _comma_   which sort of describes me! i love my cats .  the peeing on my bath mat aside . 
yeah    _comma_     i know they definitely suit some people .  i actually now technically have one .  my roommate wanted to get one    _comma_     and i felt too bad to say no .  and he actually is a pretty nice guy    _comma_     mostly because he s been affectionate from the start .  so    _comma_     we ll see how it goes! sorry again about your mat . 
here s hoping your cat grows on you _comma_  they have a funny ability to do so . 
i got the courage to contact a potential client the other day and set a rate for my work that s higher than i usually charge . 
wow good for you! i hope that it works out for you!
thanks! the work isn t terribly exciting but it felt good not having to negotiate knowing the client wanted me to do work for them . 
yeah and i bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it .  
that always makes it worth it to be honest!
someone hit my car and fled the scene
what! first of all _comma_  are you alright?
yeah  _comma_   i m fine  _comma_   the car was parked
oh   _comma_    well that s something   _comma_    at least .  i can t believe people are such cowards   _comma_    though . 
 m promoting two staff members on sunday .  they work hard and are great people . 
that s great .  do they know?
they have no clue .  they know i ask them to do more then others but are clueless .  i m excited for them and the also the stress load they will take off of me .  
well that is awesome .  i bet they won t let you down in the new positions either
 m running my first marathon sunday .  i m scared that maybe i did not train hard enough . 
i have never run a marathon
no better time to try then now . 
you can try your best and if you don t finish there is always the next one
i will not run if i can t finish .  i m stubborn i ll finish or kill over . 
well that s some sort of motivation lol
just finished my master s degree now time to take on a phd
congratulations!  what are you getting your phd in?
astrophysics
oh geeze _comma_  i didn t know i was talking to a genius .   how long is the program?
i have another     years then i ll go into teaching . 
i start my last year of my masters program friday .  i m scared i feel like i m all ready behind . 
have you tried to talk to your teacher?
no it s mostly i feel behind on my thesis .  when i started they told us keep up or drop out .  i should have known _comma_  it s one of the hardest schools to get into . 
what school is this you are talking about?
cornell university _comma_  after this year i transfer to princeton for my phd
i spent all summer getting ready to write my thesis .  i can t wait to get time to start . 
that s pretty cool that you re motivated and excited to start it .  most people would be scared and procrastinating .  you ll do great . 
i need to get it over .  i need to start paying back student loans .  it s the last thing i need to do before i can get hired as a ad professor .  
sounds like you have a plan laid out .  it also sounds like you ve already accomplished so much .  you should be very proud .  i m with you  _comma_   i have over      _comma_      in student loans .  such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate .  good luck!
i ve been paying on mine and have    still to pay .  then i want a phd so that will be another   k
i love to be snuggled up with attention and time with my boyfriend when he doesn t i get sad and jealous .  
i can understand that . 
i know he has to spend time with others but i get envious i want every minute spent together i m spoiled lol . 
you must love him very much _comma_  that s good . 
i do best feeling ever . 
i m at a new school and i won t have any friends
aw _comma_  it takes time! making friends isn t always so easy so give it a little bit of time
yes _comma_  but how do i even talk to people i don t know?
the best thing to do is join clubs and get involved .  you generally make friends by association!
i felt very great a few weeks ago when i helped an elderly women bag her groceries
that is really nice of you to do _comma_  not a lot of people help others like that anymore
yeah thats true most people don t .   i love helping those in need it s a great feeling
same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help _comma_  i will most likely bring it to you
i can t believe i didn t get that promotion at work :(
ah dang .  sorry that happened to you .  it stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more   _comma_    or who has better connections   _comma_    and not actual merit .  if you re good   _comma_    i m sure you will get recognized at some point . 
agreed _comma_  it s a popularity contest!
well  _comma_   keep a good attitude .  if you like the work and the job  _comma_   hopefully that will be enough . 
my wife cheated on me! it s absurd!!
thats very sad to hear im sorry that happened to you 
thank you _comma_  what should i do about it?
i would suggest moving on time heals all wounds
i was very happy last week helping an elderly women bag her groceries 
did she say thank you?
yes she did thank me 
what a lovely woman  _comma_   and you re lovely  _comma_   too!
ugh _comma_  my neighbor s dogs wouldn t stop barking this morning!
that s the worst! what did you do?
well i ll tell you what i didn t do .  i didn t go back to sleep _comma_  due to the noise .  i think i m going to have a word with him later . 
that sounds like a good idea .  i hope you solve the problem quickly!
remember when we were young and could run through the fields of flowers? i miss it . 
yeah _comma_  those were better times .  brings back good memories . 
maybe we can relive such times through our children . 
well _comma_  maybe yours .  mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day . 
i don t understand why people come to work to just not do their jobs i have a coworker like this . 
oh man . i have had those too . and where i am the one getting crap even though i do my job and everyone elses . i hate sitting around at work . i either want to work or go home .  i hope your boss knows your co worker is lazy?
we are on the same page i have to pick up their slack and it just irritates me to the upmost it s like just quit please or give me a raise for doing double work .  
i agree and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn t give you praise then i would quit as well or contact human resources! this kind of stuff is not acceptable . 
the desert was incredible! the taste! the look! the feel as i ate it!
sounds like you ate a delicious dessert _comma_  what did you eat?
it was chocolate ice cream dipped in crushed cookies  _comma_   marshmallows  _comma_   and chocolate sauce which had frozen to a crisp!
that sounds delicious i love chocolate cake i think that would be my favorite dessert
i think i m going to move my mother into my house with us . 
o? that s a brave and noble decision . 
yeah _comma_  she s been pretty sick lately .  i want to make sure she s here where she can get all of the care that she needs . 
that s hard but great of you to do _comma_  good luck . 
i m going shopping tomorrow _comma_  it ll be so much fun!
where will you be shopping?
i think i ll go to costco and walmart . 
nice! do you have anything in specific you want to buy?
i m so sad _comma_  my avocado was moldy this morning!
hahah it whas happened to me it the worst thing
it really is! :(
did you still eat it? or did you throw it away
my family is the best they through me a surprise birthday party . 
that s nice of them! people stopped doing that for me once i got older .  i miss them
i was amazed they even did that but very grateful i haven t had anything in a while also so you wasn t alone your family will do something and you will enjoy it .  
well _comma_  i m happy for you :) it shows that they care
i was shocked when i found out my wife cheated on me
thats horrible! im so sorry to hear that .   why would she do that?
im not sure what should i do though ?
it depends  _comma_   if you love her  _comma_   you could try to work it out .   or you could cheat on her too
my friend taught his dog some tricks .  it s really fun to watch!
o yea? i
it s amazing how quickly the dog responds to the commands .  my friend must really know what he s doing . 
i m trying to teach mine tricks myself  i think that s fun to watch!
i was taking an important test in one of my classes the other day .  i m ashamed to say that i cheated . 
i ve cheated on occasion .  it s never right but it s easy .  at least you re ashamed of it . 
yeah .  i m thinking about coming clean about it to my professor before he finds out on his own . 
that s your decision to make _comma_  but i think it would at least put you in control of the situation . 
my wife and i are going out to one of my favorite restaurants tonight . 
that sounds fun .  is it a special occasion?
not really  _comma_   just felt like going out .  i m thinking about ordering something i haven t had before  _comma_   but .  i don t know .  i m weird about trying new foods . 
i understand .  sticking with what you know seems safer . 
i bought a used car a couple months ago and i have to say it s holding up really well for a   year old car .  it s like new . 
you must be loving it
i am _comma_  you never know what shape a used car really is until you have it for a while . 
true that _comma_  you cant be too sure until you use it
i have a performance review coming up at work in a couple of weeks . 
tough week ahead .  do you think you have met your expectations thus far?
oh yeah .  i m pretty sure the review is going to go well .  i might even get a raise!
sounds good .  your supervisor must proud of your work and your displayed high self esteem
i just got notice that my mortgage payment has gone up this year and i m so mad about it . 
oh no! that has so happened to me before! it was only by a couple dollars a month but i so needed those couple of dollars at the time .  i would be maaaddd
i am _comma_  it went up    dollars .  
call the bank and get it fixed asap! that s got to be so annoying for you!
i have to go over the paperwork _comma_  it may be because my insurance went up . 
i don t play the lottery  _comma_   ever  _comma_   but a friend recently gave me a scratch off ticket . 
i buy those like twice a year and never win . 
i won     !
wow! that s awesome! what did you do with it?
i blew it on online video games _comma_  lol . 
hey _comma_  why not? it s unexpected money!
that is always the best kind .   i still won t be buying lottery tickets _comma_  lol . 
yeah i feel like you get lucky once then it s all downhill from there . 
my girlfriend and i were at a party friday night .  i couldn t find her anywhere _comma_  and got worried . 
where was she?
in a spare bedroom with her ex _comma_  laying on the bed and kissing him . 
does she have a new ex now?
worked out for the best _comma_  she was honestly a pain anyways . 
she sure does .  i am not putting up with that _comma_  lol . 
i would not put up with it either 
i love the rain .   it makes everything feel fresh . 
i love when the rain his the soil in the open field  _comma_  the smell of wet dirt is just refreshing
i agree .   it hasn t rained here in weeks .   i miss the raing . 
im stoked to go to the park later today
i bet you are .  what are you going to do? 
take my dog to the park and meet up with some friends!
sounds like a real good time i hope you enjoy it 
i felt bad about sleeping in today
why is that 
i fell behind on things i needed to get done
you will be alright buddy
i feel like a have accomplished a lot this summer
what have you done this year if you dont mind me asking?
ive gotten a lot of work done and spent time with friends and family
that is great _comma_  well there is still time to go this year!

that sounds great .  a nice long walk in perfect weather .  there s hardly anything better . 
my brother just bought a new car . 
are you excited for him or jealous? lol 
well _comma_  i can t help but feel like he only did it to make me feel inferior . 
i feel you! i know its hard having siblings sometimes! go buy a toy car and park it on top of his .  
i got a threatening phone call .  and now i m scared . 
can you report the caller?
i should be able to .  i recognized the voice _comma_  it s someone that i used to know . 
be sure to do it _comma_  otherwise they could keep harassing you
i have studied and i am ready to take my test soon
what class is it for?
chemistry
i never took chemistry .  do you feel prepared for the test?
yes!
i am thankful for my supportive family
that s great .   have they always been as supportive as they are now
yes i have been very fortunate
nice .   what do you do for a living
i went out to the garden and there were a ton of mosquitoes _comma_  i couldn t even do any gardening . 
have you thought about spraying your garden?
i thought about it but they were coming from the grass around it and i m worried the dog would get sick if i sprayed the grass
perhaps there is an all natural remedy you could try
hopefully .  there were so many i thought i was in a jungle . 
i was shocked how nice the weather has been the past couple days
same here _comma_  i m in texas .   where are you located
in the midwest!
nice! i used to live in st .  paul _comma_  mn .   weather s like a tundra which is why i m down here
i was mowing the lawn today and it started storming out of nowhere!
were you able to get inside fast?
no .  i was in the middle of the yard and it was sunny _comma_  next thing i know it s pouring down rain and i m soaked . 
oh wow! that would be annoying!
im envious of my friends who are off work today
how did they get off work midweek?
thats just their normal schedule
that would be nice but not fun that you don t have the same days off . 
we go on vacation once a year as a family . 
where is your favorite place to go?
i just love going _comma_  when it gets closer to when we are leaving i look forward to it . 
i can imagine _comma_  i hope you have a great time this year
my son starts kindergarten soon .  he is my first one . 
i remember when my first child started _comma_  i was a nervous wreck . 
they sent out an email saying that he may end up with a substitute teacher until they hire someone .  
so they don t even have teachers yet? wow _comma_  that s crazy . 
it is! and we are paying for the school _comma_  i m not to happy . 
i have no friends and i am lonely
have you tried getting out and meeting new people?
no _comma_  it is difficult to meet people in my area because i like in a farm .  i only talk to the animals
what about online friends?
can you be my online friend?
my friends went to dinner without me
that would hurt my feelings .  are you alright?
i m fine _comma_  just disappointed mostly
i totally understand that .  i m sorry . 
i woke up and my car had a flat tire
that sucks! did you have a spare on you?
no _comma_  but i was able to get it towed easily enough
that is good to hear . 
a co worker was having issues finishing a project
that s understandable .  what kind of project was it? were you involved?
it was a major work project _comma_  i stepped in to help him
that s so generous of you .  it s people like you that make the work week bearable!
i was really apprehensive about going to university at the age of    . 
that s okay _comma_  i m    and still in college .  how did it go for you? 
it went pretty well! i got great grades and made friends despite the age difference . 
that s awesome .  i m glad it worked out well for you .  :)
thank you! in the end i had no reason to worry about it . 
once i was stranded hours from home in a snowstorm .  i ended up going to a stranger s house to wait it out
oh wow .  i would have been so scared .  more of a stranger than the storm
well  _comma_   she was really nice and we had been waiting together in the snow for awhile  _comma_   so i felt i could trust her . 
well that was nice .  how long were you stuck there
i was looking at advertisements of my childhood toys recently and felt strangely overwhelmed with emotion . 
did the ads bring up good memories i hope?
yes! especially the ads for toys i haven t thought of in years _comma_  like boglins . 
i have absolutely no idea what boglins are _comma_  but i m sure they were awesome!
once when i was a kid i got caught in a riptide with my sister .  it was very scary!
sounds frightening! was this off the coast of a beach or something?
yes _comma_  martinique beach in nova scotia .  the currents are very strong . 
that is one of my greatest fears .  did you have to swim sideways from the current to escape?
yes that s right! i was a strong swimmer so we made it . 
great to hear that you made it out ok!
i suppose to be on a committed diet but i kind of cheated today . 
well  _comma_   i can understand that .  it s very hard to be on a very strict diet  _comma_   without a break here and now!
it is my coworkers said they was going to burger king and i couldn t resist i feel so bad and guilty . 
well   _comma_    i am sure you are disappointed   _comma_    but all you can do now is just get back on the diet again and try to be more dedicated .  it s hard   _comma_    i know!
i been out of school for about   years i am finally going back to college . 
is this a career change?
yes i am going for nursing i can t wit i am over joyed going to be hard work but i got this . 
oh hey  _comma_   i m a nursing graduate! it ll be difficult at first  _comma_   but you ll get the hang of it . 
that is great to know i can t wait soon will be like you . 
we lost our faily dog she had been with us since i was    years old . 
aw _comma_  that sucks .  did you give her a proper burial?
yes we did my mom loved her so much especially when me and my brither moved out she is hurt and down so bad . 
awwww _comma_  i am so sorry .  have you thought about getting a new pup?
thank you and yes but i want to give her time to heal hopefully by christmas she will be a little better and open to it . 
starting a new job can be different on my first day last month i can say that was me . 
yea _comma_  a new job is useless pretty stressful . 
i would say i was more nervous then anything i think the new setting was over whelming but a month later i feel a lot better now .  
it will be ok in the end . 
i had a car accident the other day!
oh that is a real bummer .  were you hurt?
yeah it was! no luckily nobody got hurt thanks .  the worst part was actually having to talk to the insurance company
ok glad you did not get injured .  i hope your car gets fixed . 
thanks! yeah it will be fine i m sure .  i just hate having to deal with the insurance _comma_  but at least i had insurance!
i got divorced a few years agi
sorry to hear that
thanks _comma_  it s ok though! it got settled and i m happy
well that s good .  you never know what to say in that situation
yeah i know what you mean! it was hard at the time but i m a lot happier for it now
i wish yo the best
i was clearing out my attic recently and came accross an old suitcase stuffed full of all my childhood toys   _comma_    medals   _comma_    school reports   _comma_    photos etc!
that must of been fun to go through . 
it was brilliant .   my mum must have gathered it up over the years .   i spent hours going through it all .   it made me feel so nostalgic .   i think its a great idea though _comma_  i might start doing it for my kids . 
that is cool .  is your mother still alive?
no sadly so i didnt even know it was there .   was definitely a wonderful surprise to find it . 
man that was hard to deal with today . 
what was?
i had a lull in work and the store was empty _comma_  and there was nobody in there for an hour .   i was about to go insane . 
really? did you manage to cope?
first it was just boring then i started to actually get pretty lonely .   i saw if there was something i could read while i waited . 
and was there?
yeah there was a magazine or two .   i got by
good
oh .  but you are still here . 
my    year old cat died recently .  i was devastated . 
im sorry to hear that
thanks .  i still think about him all the time . 
you ever ever plan to get another ?
i had two at the time so i still have one cat now :)
you know i have a friend that has a very successful business that he started with only a few thousand dollars
really _comma_  how did they do it?
they started an irrigation sprinkler business with just a few contracts and its blown up and now he s handling large companies
amazing! well done to him . 
i figured out why my air conditioner wasn t working earlier .  i was very pleased with myself . 
well done _comma_  at least you will sit in your room excited and relaxed now
exactly .  it was so dang hot today _comma_  too . 
heat wave is getting so terrible theses days .  i even watched on cnn that the whole of new south wales is experiencing a drought _comma_  so sad
i kept getting stuck behind an irritating man while grocery shopping yesterday .  he was so loud and always in my aisle . 
that sounds unfortunate .  you must have been so annoyed with him!
i was! he had an uncanny knack of blocking me and taking up the whole width of the aisle . 
people like that should just do shopping online instead of ruining the experience for everyone else!
when i see little homeless girls i feel like a father . 
do you have daughters of your own?
no i do not _comma_  and probably never will . 
why is that?
i was stuck in traffic the other day for so long _comma_  when it was supposed to be clear . 
yea traffic sucks
unless there is good music playing . 
well yea thats true
when i go for a walk in autumn _comma_  it brings up some good memories . 
same here .  it reminds me of my childhood for some reason . 
yes _comma_  the smell especially . 
exactly _comma_  i am overcome with nostalgia and get tears of joy sometimes .  
last year i hardly could hide my impatience to go on vacation . 
i bet! did it turn out nice?
yes _comma_  i had a good time . 
that s good .  i can t wait for my vacation!
i ve seen a kid beet up a dog once _comma_  it got me very angry . 
that s terrible! did the dog survive?
yes  _comma_   the dog turned out to be fine  _comma_   kid said he was training he her to be stronger . 
maybe someone should train the kid to be stronger .  by beating him up!
sometimes i feel like i am really an alright person . 
what i do is to write all the good things i did within the week _comma_  i think you should do the same
it s a good idea  _comma_   but we should also write our mistakes  _comma_   to not repeat them in the future . 
i agree with you buddy
my last vacation we went to florida and a lot of prep work went into getting everything ready

glade all was well

while i was eating dinner last week _comma_  my wife and i watched a guy pick up the rear end of a newer pick up truck . 
he sounds pretty strong .  any reason in particular that he did that?
my guess would be because he was drunk .  it was still quite the sight to see . 
no kidding .  definitely some quality entertainment for dinner time!
so my wife and i after saving all year are going on our first vacation together next month . 
that must be so exciting!
my wife is so happy .  she has never seen the ocean before . 
i hope you both have a great time!
i went on an interview for a job .

last year during a bad storm _comma_  a tornado touched down right across the street from our house .

i m glad that you are okay . 
my family and i recently moved _comma_  and we found a box of our oldest child s baby toys from    years ago . 
i bet that was quite the blast from the past

yes they do .  mine are already out of college
we packed up everything in the car to go visit my family . 
oh _comma_  are you going on a trip?
we went on vacation to see my family in another state .  i was very happy to be going . 
that sounds like a fun time . 
last month for my   th anniversary at my job _comma_  my coworkers threw me a party . 
that is so nice of them!
i had no idea till i walked into the office with my boss on lunch .  i was completely shocked . 
i am so happy for you! congrats!
i recently spent a full weekend relaxing at the beach . 
really?
yeah .   it was great to get away from work and family pressures for just a bit _comma_  and to enjoy some peace and quiet . 
that s fun
last month _comma_  my cat sam passed away .  he was    years old . 
oh no! i m so sorry! it s so difficult to lose a pet . 
he was more than a pet _comma_  he was truly my best friend .

i feeling very happy and overwhelmed that she presented me my dream bike . 
last week _comma_  there was a front move through our area that produced many very powerful storms . 
did it rain a lot?
it really did .  also _comma_  there were over    confirmed tornado touch downs in my county alone . 
that must be really scary to go through . 
i was going to a pumpkin patch with my sister in law _comma_  and i let her drive my car . 
that sounds like fun! what happened?
i wasn t feeling good so she drove _comma_  but she drives kind of fast .  usually i don t let anyone drive my car . 
yeah  i understand that .  i don t let anyone drive my car _comma_  either .  i hope everything worked out okay!
a stranger bought me groceries last sunday .  i only know them through an online forum . 
that seems like it would be a little awkward to me . 
they saw a post i d made about losing my job and messaged me .  i m going to embroider them something as thanks . 
well  _comma_   they sound like they are actually just a nice person trying to help you out  _comma_   that is really nice . 
i was cleaning out the attic and found a bunch of old photo albums . 
that s always a nice find .

i bet it was! i love looking at photo albums
i have a buddy who decided to take up playing guitar a few years ago . 
that is nice .  did you start playing guitar with him?
i tried _comma_  lol .   i recently heard him play for the first time in over a year .   his skill levels astounds me . 
that is good . 
i work from home and sometimes it makes me a bit sad to know that i m here alone . 
i am also working from home from time to time .  i could feel some time lonely . 
i m sorry to hear you are in the same boat sometimes .  do you have any advice on how to make it feel less lonely? 
i usually get out after finishing work to feel less lonely . 
once on my way to work i slipped and fell after i got off the bus and everyone stared at me .  i laid there until the bus drove away because i felt so humiliated . 
oh _comma_  that must have been so embarrassing .  
the sad thing is i do stuff like that all the time :(
i m sorry it happens to us at times . 
i stopped at a gas station on the way to work last week and got gas and a scratch off ticket and won      . 
congratulations! that is so cool!
yes _comma_  it s the most money i  have ever won on a lottery ticket .  it was very shocking . 
i hope you have fun with that money . 
last week _comma_  one of my coworkers took credit for a job i had completed .  i had to get to the manager to get things straightened out . 
i can t believe your coworker would do that to you! did your manager listen?
yes he did .  he knew that the other guy had been at a different job site _comma_  i will still not very happy about the situation . 
i wouldn t be either .  are you going to try to talk to your coworker about it?
school starts back next week so last weekend i took my girls to disney world .

yes we did they loved it it was such a thrill and the shows and rides was so fun . 
they will really appreciate that when they are older and look back on it .  
last spring _comma_  it rained so much my basement ended up flooding . 
oh god _comma_  what do you do at that time
well  _comma_   i did my best to save what i could .  a lot of irreplaceable things were destroyed however  _comma_   photos among other things . 
how did you feel at that time
i was out in the yard and i found a rabbits nest with a bunch of babies in it right in the middle of the yard!
oh wow! are the babies ok?
they are fine .  i put some tree branches over it to give it some protection from predators and the elements 
good thinking .  i m sure the parent bunnies appreciated that . 
all my cucumber plants died this week due to too much rain
oh man .  what a bummer!  i love cucumbers and hummus!  do you have anything else you re growing that survived?
my tomatoes and peppers are doing really well for starters .  
oh good _comma_  i m glad the entire garden didn t get ruined .   i would love to plant a garden one day soon since i went vegan plant based about   months ago .   happy tomato eating to you!
the neighbor s trash can had blown over and there was garbage all over the road
oh what a mess .  i would hope that they picked it up . 
they did as soon as they got home and saw it
well at least they cleaned up after .  i would have been more annoyed if they didnt . 
im happy with what all i have accomplished this summer

midwest
ok im at the south east
last week in the middle of the night _comma_  someone drove off the road and took out a large section of my fence around my yard . 
ohh wow! that s not cool
they didn t stick around or anything and it s going to be pretty expensive to have it all replaced . 
i wish people would take responsibilities for their own actions
i dropped my grocery bag in the parking lot and it spilled everywhere
oh man! hopefully nothing broke! 
nope but i did have to chase down a few cans that rolled away lol
at least it sounds like you recovered everything! 
i felt bad when i cut someone off in traffic this morning
he accused me of stealing from him
who did
sorry _comma_  that was an error! any way over to your conversation . who did you cut off that made you feel bad?
im envious of everyone who is outside enjoying the sun right now
yea i hear ya .  im stuck here at work for another day too . 
same here _comma_  but the weekend will be fun
i just hope it doesnt rain this weekend .

good for you! i bet you will do amazing .  best of luck!
i have no friends .  one time i went into a restaurant and ate by myself .  everyone laughed
i feel the same one and lately it seems to be getting worse .  i ve never been brave enough to go eat alone . 
yes _comma_  that is why i am in front of my computer all day . 
i get that .  i work all day then come home to the same routine everyday . 
i envy everyone outside right now enjoying the weather

im looking out the window waiting to go out lol
haha _comma_  same! just one more hour for me .  hope you can enjoy it soon!
a good co worker of mine lost his job
that is not good _comma_  what happened
his boss felt he was under performing .   it s a shame because he was fun to work with
that is never a good thing _comma_  i hope they land on their feet
a co worker of mine was able to complete a complicated project quickly
how did they do that?
he was more skilled than i thought
oh _comma_  well that is a nice surprise though!
i get so mad when workers don t wash their hands in restaurants i had this happen to me recent i left the place immediately . 
that is nasty _comma_  how do they get away with that?
right i was so sicken i said yes this will be the last time i go to this pizza hut it s like would you want someone to do you and your food that way . 
exactly  _comma_   i would report them  _comma_   so nasty
i did first thing the next morning . 
my car has been acting strange lately

strange noises and grinding _comma_  i hope it doesn t break down
i hope so too _comma_  get it checked out!

my granddad means so much to me i still wear his necklace even though he passed . 
i am sorry for your loss _comma_  at least you got some time together
yes and thank you i know he is close in spirit i get emotional sometimes but the memories we had was great . 
i feel that way about my grandma _comma_  it is sad that by the time we are born they are so old
the time just slips away have to cherish the time we have with them . 
i thought the service uber was good but i had a bad experience today was so upset . 
i think lyft is better
i ll have to try them my panera was over a hour late and my lunch was over once it arrived .  
i would hate that
a close friend of mine is moving away
where to?
out of state _comma_  it s a shame because we were good friends
oh  _comma_   i am sorry to hear that  _comma_   why did they move away?
a friend of mine was able to build this complicated desk in a few hours
they sounds very complicated
he s very talented with tools _comma_  it d probably take anyone else half a day at least
that is nice to have
a friend of mine is coming to visit
having friends over is always nice!
yeah  _comma_   he s a good friend  _comma_   it ll be a lot of fun when he arrives
i bet .  hope you all have a fantastic time!
a friend who i hadn t seen since school started work at my job
how do you feel about that?
he was the last person i expected to see
are you guys in good relations?
i found some old school papers of mine
did it bring back a lot of old mermories?
yeah _comma_  i ve come a long way
thats good that you have progressed
a co worker has been flirting with me at work .   i turned her down though since i have a girlfriend
she is a crappy person _comma_  flirting with someone who is in a relationship .  good on you  stand up guy
it s been hard though _comma_  i ve had many girls interested in me lately
lol  well poor you .  i have always had guys doing the same and it means nothing to me .  if i am in a relationship . or heck even when i am not . i don t get interested in random people generally .  i have to know who someone is . remember that  what lasts is who someone is . someone you want to grow old with . bodies won t last . 
one time while i was waking up in the middle of the night _comma_  i saw a little girl sitting beside my bed
that must of been weird .  who was it?
it was a doll someone put next to me
was it suppose to scare you?
i have been faithful to my relationship with my boyfriend
thats awesome
yah _comma_  we are always happy
well i hope it lasts forever
i have an exam in the next month and am prepared for it
that s good! i guess you studied a lot?
yah _comma_  been studying for a while now . 
that s good .  i am sure you will do great on it . 
i took a taxi and the driver was sneezing right to my side
ouch _comma_  that sounds pretty gross!
yah _comma_  it felt so distigusting
i d avoid that taxi driver again if you have the chance . 
imagine  _comma_  i started working out two months ago  _comma_  only to weigh myself and i have gained some weight
i hope it was maybe the weight of the muscle that the scale was picking up . 
i hope so _comma_ i  got a little discouraged . but i will keep working out
yes _comma_  don t let that stop you .  also pay attention to what you eat as well .  it s even more important than the exercise portion . 
i ve been feeling pretty wholesome recently .  
i don t know whether that s a good or bad thing .  which is it?
it s good _comma_  i just meant that i can be by myself and feel alright . 
that s great! it s definitely a good thing when you can be yourself . 
about a week ago on the way home i smelt something so bad that it made me anxious . 
what was it i wonder?
i don t even want to remember that smell . 
it must ve been nasty like puke
i always try to stay positive no matter what .  
i like that philosophy .  here lately _comma_  has it been easier or harder to stay positive?
let s put it that way _comma_  even when it s harder i still remain positive . 
i like that _comma_  how long have you felt this way about life?
anytime the weather is sunny i feel happy . 
wow _comma_  its good to warm
yes _comma_  warmth is better than cold . 
it is easier to walk around when its sunny also
am so frustrated by the police officer who tried to harass me
what exactly did he do 
he tried to take my driving licence by force on over speeding claims which was not true
yes _comma_  some people have to stay away form law enforcement jobs . 
next month my wife and i are going on vacation to hawaii . 
wow! i bet you two are very excited! 
we are _comma_  it will be our first vacation together since we got married . 
that is wonderful .  our first vacation after getting married was full of fun _comma_  sun and adventure .  those are the best! 
i damn certain sure this time round i will pass my statistics retake exam
you sound very confident .  that s good
i can t imagine getting a fail for a second time . 
i know what you mean .  just believe in yourself
last week my neighbor began making renovations on his home . 
is he being too noisy?
yeah _comma_  that s the problem .  on weekends he likes to start hammering and sawing at  am . 
i see how that can be annoying _comma_  have you asked him to stop doing that?
the day that i got accepted into nursing school was just an ordinary day .  
you weren t excited about it?
well i had been waiting for weeks and was unaware _comma_  but at the end of a stressful day i checked my mail and the letter came in to let me know if i got in or not .  
i understand .  stress is a definite mood killer
i agree _comma_  but then i opened the letter and it ended up being the best day of my life! 
i had an eye surgery recently now i am anxiously waiting for perfect vision .

maths 
i love math _comma_  good luck with your exams than . 
i was acting like a arrogant peacock today .  
why were you acting like that?
i don t know _comma_  woke up in too good of a mood i guess . 
i m glad you were in a good mood . 
a few days ago i ve met a couple of people that got me feeling negative things _comma_  even though i don t even know them . 
did they say or do anything specifically to you that made you feel that way?
not really  _comma_   maybe just a bit  _comma_   it s how they said it i guess . 
i understand how that can make you feel a certain way .  unfortunately _comma_  there are those types of people around every corner . 
last week at work _comma_  my coworkers threw me a   th anniversary party at our company office . 
oh wow!    years at your job! you must be well liked there .  
i like to think i am .  i had no idea this was going to happen . 
it must have been a wonderful surprise for you . 
my mom called me the day after my    birthday .  not to wish me happy birthday _comma_  but to delivery awful news .  
oh my goodness _comma_  what was the terrible news?
she called and told me our brother had been in a terrible accident and that we needed to come to the er immediately .  
i am so sorry _comma_  i hope your brother ended up being okay . 
no he passed away that day .  i will never forget the day after my    birthday .  it was pretty aweful . 
i have not had any sleep for the past three days only to come back home and my neighbor is having a loud party
dang _comma_  that s not good .  what did you end up doing??
i stormed into his house like a mad man _comma_ i was not having it . that had to stop . 
oh wow .  did the police get called? i hope you didn t get in trouble .  
i m eagerly anticipating the break from the routine of business
yeah? what is changing?
i m going on a holiday soon!
brilliant .  here are you going?
bora bora

as a nursing student i m able to look forward to take care of people when they are feeling bad .  
that s so generous of you .  the world could use more people like you . 
yes during on of my clinical rounds i was able to handle pediatric patients which i felt so happy to do .  
caring for both the young and the old .  any hospital would be lucky to have you on staff!
i forgot my friend s birthday date 
oh my _comma_  how did she react?
she was confused because i showed up a week late
ha! do you feel bad about it?
i am so embarrassed . 
looking for a new job can be stressful .  
it certainly can .  what type of job are you looking for?
well i went on   interviews to work in a clinic and all went well _comma_  but they have not called me back and its been a week now .  
maybe they had lots of other candidates to see
yeah _comma_  but bills are coming up so its making me very worried and nervous .  
i know that feeling .  something will come through though
yeah maybe if at least one calls me than my patients well let up .  i cant stop waiting next to my cell phone .  each call i get i get excited .  
have you ever felt guilty for sleeping all day?
yes! i feel like the day escaped me .  have you done that recently?
yes _comma_  i am thinking to do it again today though .  
it is friday _comma_  that would be a nice way to start the weekend!
i am so jealous because my sibling is going on a holiday and i have work to do
ugh i can imagine .  but your time will come _comma_  be patient!
yeah but i really need a break
have you tried yoga? it can help in the meanwhile till you get a proper vacation . 
i haven t _comma_  i guess i will do that . 
yeah i went into the hospital with chest pain and the doctors came in and told me i needed to have emergency surgery .  
oh no! did you get the surgery?
i did and what an experience .  i was alone in the hospital getting prepped for a major surgery not knowing if i was going to make it .  
but you have recovered now .  right?
yea everthing is going well _comma_  but it still sends chills down my spine
we both want a boy _comma_  but a girl at this point would be perfect as well

good job! do you feel proud of yourself?
yes very .  those longs nights i stayed up getting ready helped .  
hard work always pays off! keep it up . 
i agree .  this is a lesson learned in life to always be ready for whats coming up .  
i walked into the room while she was cooking and was very quiet .  i felt bad about what i did .  
what did you do?
well i went out with old college buds and got trashed and slept with another woman .

i didnt study for my test and i felt i bombed it _comma_  but when i checked my grade i made an a!

yes i agree .  even now i cant beleive i made an a!
a man recently tried to break into our house late at night . 
oh wow .  that is some scary stuff!! what happend?
it was about  am .  he was kicking our front door repeatedly .   my kids and wife were terrified as we waited for the cops to come . 
did they catch the person?
they found him down the block  _comma_   kicking at another house s door .   he was arrested  _comma_   i believe . 
i feel guilty for lying to mom that i had passed my exams
you shouldn t like to your mom .  i think you should tell her the truth about what really happened . 
yah _comma_  i will tell her when she comes back from work
that sounds like a great idea!
i felt very unpleasant last week when i fell to the ground skateboarding and lots of people saw it happen
oh no! you have to have a tough mentality when you do that as it can be rough to have people see you fail
yeah it was bad but i kept practicing and eventually learned pretty quick
that s good! practice makes perfect and if everyone stopped when they failed _comma_  we would not have as much as we do today
last week at work a coworker tried to take credit for a job that i had completed . 
that s terrible .  did you let others know that you had completed the job?
i talked to my boss and get it all straightened out _comma_  but it was still a really crazy situation . 
i could imagine .  some people stoop low to take credit for what others do . 
i recently had surgery and needed help around the house and my best friend volunteered to help me .  
what kind of surgery was it?
i had knee surgery so my normal household chores is hard to keep up but she kept her word and she has helped   a week since she is so true to her word i have a great friend . 
thats awesome! its great to have friends their for someone . 
my dog chewed my favorite pair of shoes up last week . 
oh no! did you scold him?
no she got me with those eyes but i was very irate with her for a few days and she knew it . 
i d be angry too _comma_  but it s hard to get mad at doggos . 
it is they are loving she didn t mean to i bet lol . 
i finished college this summer and now i m on to a new job in nursing i am nervous .  
congrats to you!  what kind of nurse are you looking to be?
i will be a rn i think i am over thinking the new role but i am self assured i will do great this is my passion . 
i have no doubt that you will be a great rn!
college is the top way to get in debt but my brother paid all his tuition out of pocket . 
that is awesome _comma_  what is his secret?
he worked   jobs and prior to starting he saved money i m very influenced by his method i m going to give it a try so i can be debt free as well . 
being debt free can be a great feeling
last year my wife got laid off from her job . 
im sorry to hear that .  does she have a job now?
at the time it happened _comma_  my boss found out about it and gave me more hours to make up for our loss of income till she got another job . 
well that was nice of your boss .  its great to have good people in this world
my girlfriend is moving in this weekend .   this is the first relationship i have had that actually will be living with me . 
are you excited for it?
i am very excited for it .   im ready to start this next chapter in my life and hoping everything goes well after the move . 
i hope this is the true love for you
i have a job interview coming up later this week .   i feel confident about it but would love for it to be over
you got this just be yourself and professional obviously and don t over think it .  
thats my plan going into it .   it would be awesome if i got the job but if not i am happy where i am at too
you will get it happy thoughts only and if not something better is in store .  
i love to help my daughter with her school work and exams . 
it sounds like you are a great parent .   does she appreciate all the help you give?
thank you and yes she does the memories together just pleases me so much i cherish these moments . 
she will definitely appreciate it when she gets older too .   i still remember my dad helping me with math homework and cant thank him enough for the help he gave me throughout the years . 
after being married for   years to my first wife _comma_  i found out she was having an affair behind my back . 
im sorry about that .  how did you find out?
she came out and told me about it .  it was one of the worst times in my life . 
that stinks .  are you still with her or did you leave her?
my dog just learned how to ring the bell on the doorknob when he needs to go out
whoa that is really cool .  did you train him to do that?
i put the bell on the door so it would ring when it opened and he got used to that _comma_  so now he associates the sound with having to go out .  
that is amazing .  must be a very smart dog . 
i canceled a dinner with a old friend because i was just so tired had a long work week .  
i understand! as we get older _comma_  it s hard to do it all everyday!
it is i just feel a little guilt ridden because i told her i had an emergency instead of telling her the truth because she would have tried to talk me into still coming out . 
it happens _comma_  but definitely be honest as you would want someone to be honest with you
last month my car threw a rod and needed to have the engine overhauled _comma_  leaving me without a way to get to work and back . 
oh no _comma_  are you able to afford the repair for it?
well _comma_  a friend of mine let me borrow his car for a entire month while mine was repaired .  he just tossed me the keys and said bring it back when your done . 
what a great friend you have .  definitly get him a gift when you are done . 
i working to save enough money to take my wife on a vacation to vermont next year .  i hope i can save enough . 
i hope you can too .  how is it going?
i m about half way there .  i want to save enough to rent a cottage on one of the lakes up there so i still have a ways to go . 
that s great! i have faith that you can do it . 
thank you .  i hope i reach my goal . 
i paid off my credit card before buying my house .   i didnt realize how expensive owning would be and after some repairs i owe more than i started with on my card . 
that s really good! do you think you re ever going to use the card again?
im hoping i wont have to .   unless something major comes up i m not planning on putting anything on credit again . 
that is wise .  i too am trying to pay off my credit card debts .  after that _comma_  i m cutting them up . 
i was with some friends and went up to my room .   it was late at night and the lights were off .   when i left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg . 
that would have really scared me . 
it did scare me .   i let out a scream .   one of my friends went to school for wildlife .   he captured the bat and let it outside which was great . 
i bet you are thankful that your friend was there . 
i brought home a cake for my family _comma_  but i ate all of it! ugh . 
all of it??? oh no .  how bad do you feel right now?
uhm  _comma_   i feel awesome in my tummy  _comma_   but bad in my heart lol
haha i bet .  im sure they were looking forward to it . 
my roommate was very forgetful .   he would sometimes leave his dogs poop bags inside instead of bringing them out to the garage . 
ewww . 
it was gross .   all of a sudden you would smell something and then notice the bag sitting there . 
why would it be in the house to begin with? does the dog poop in the house?
i was watching tv and saw people with a happy family .  it breaks my heart . 
you are having trouble with family ?
my family isn t close _comma_  it s depressing . 
mine isn t either .  are you married?
i m so hyped _comma_  i m going to the movies!
awesome! what are you going to see?
not sure yet _comma_  i ll have to ask my friends
whatever it is _comma_  i hope you have a good time!
i broke my leg _comma_  it s so upsetting . 
oh no!  how d you do that?
i fell off a roof!
what were you doing on the roof?
we decided to go fishing last week . 
did you catch anything?
no!  and i was so confident that we would!
did you at least have fun?
we did!  and some of the research work that we did let us experiment more than normal . 
my daughter graduated high school!
congrats! you must be proud!
i am _comma_  thanky ou!
my daughter is only in eigth grade we have a while to go
i believed my father wouldn t let me down . 
that is good to feel that way .  you don t want to feel like someone close to you would let you down .  did it work out for you?
no  _comma_   he totally bailed on me  _comma_   as usual . 
oh i am sorry .  that is sad .  remember that it is not your fault .  i would think of the people who have been there for you .  
i m about to move and i m terrified! what if it has bugs? or mold? or something else i don t know about?
oh gosh _comma_  you also scared of bugs?? that s my worst fear
yes! i can t imagine them crawling on me when i sleep : 
i would have a heart attack! 
i remember eating my baba s pierogies as a child _comma_  so yummy . 
i have no idea what those are!
they are ukrainian pasta _comma_  kind of like stuffed pasta . 
oh ok .  i like ravioli is it like that?
i am so sad i have no pierogies . 
what are pierogies? a type of food?
they are ukrainian dumplings . 
ah nice  _comma_   i love dumplings  _comma_   what are in them?
the milk i drank this mornign went bad!
that s no good _comma_  did you throw it out?
yes _comma_  but not before i drank some .  : 
hope you don t get sick!  that would be a bad start to the weekend . 
i once had a fluffy cat named leo _comma_  but he got lymphoma and i had to have him put to sleep . 
oh _comma_  i am so sorry .  it has to be the most difficult thing to have to do .  i had to do that with my gorgeous lab   i still miss him!
i m sorry to hear about your lab as well .  they are very sweet dogs . 
indeed they are .  and so are many cats   the farm i used to live on has a ginger tom .  he s quite the character and used to visit me regularly!
i love ginger cats! leo was a ginger _comma_  and i have one right now named chunk . 
this fella is called oliver .  he s a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers .  he would bring half eaten ones to my door!
yikes! that doesn t sound pleasant _comma_  but i know they do that to try to show you they like you .  they think you appreciate the gifts . 
oh  _comma_   i shouldn t be ungrateful  _comma_   lol! at least he kills them before delivering them .  a friends cat used to deliver live mice into the bathtub!
i was so happy!  i have been working so hard for this company since i started so this is a great sign in my opinion!  
did you get a promotion?
not yet but i did get a raise!  if the company takes over i will get to be in charge of the helpdesk though!
wow _comma_  great job!
thank you! it s insane up here sometimes but i feel like i could be a good team lead . 
i m really scared to go back to school . 
oh no!  what has you scared?
it s all new to me _comma_  i ve never done it before
it ll be okay i promise .   first few days will be weird but you ll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule . 
my mother died _comma_  i m a mess . 
oh dang thats so horrible
thank you :(
it gets better with time but it must be hard
i really miss hastings .   i spent so much time in that store when i first started college .   both just hanging out and working . 
i remember that store! i loved going shopping there _comma_  was it your first job?
it wasn t my first but it was my most favorite retail job i had
yeah  _comma_   i bet  _comma_   it looked like a fun place to work .   especially for a college job . 
it really was .   it was so  laid back and chill .   i also made a ton of great friends there . 
i pray i can do well in school
are you having any specific problem areas?
not yet _comma_  but i haven t started yhet
okay .  i hope you do well too . 
i ve really wanted a ford excursion for a long time . 
interesting  _comma_   those things are huge  _comma_   do they even make them any more?
they haven t made them for quite a few years .   but i met a guy that just picked one up in the last few days!
do you have a large family _comma_  or do you just like the idea of a large suv?
we don t have a huge family   _comma_    just   .   but my wife does daycare   _comma_    and our current vehicle only has   seats   _comma_    so she s stuck at home fairly frequently . 
  is fairly large i would say .  i hope you get your giant car one day . 
thanks!  if not  _comma_   we ll still manage just fine .   it would be nice  _comma_   though . 
i m scared to go to the cottage
it is a big change .  what is scaring you?
i don t like bugs!
i hate bugs too .  you should exterminate before you move in
i am sad my cousin is moving away . 
is it really far?
yes _comma_  another country
oh no .  im sorry to hear that
i had some friends over and went upstairs to my room .   all the lights were off and when i left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg . 
well _comma_  that would be terrifying! were you afraid that a vampire was there?
hahahaha _comma_  that piece hadnt crossed my mind although it should have with all the vampire movies i had seen!  i let out a scream and one of my friends captured the bat and let it outside to be free . 
well _comma_  that would be very creepy! they would hear my scream in the next town over!
i was totally ready for my garage sale
you were ready? that s good to hear . 
yes and we made       .   !
aweomse .   treat yo self . gif
i have an interview coming up .   its for a position that someone else already has but i need to do this interview to get my name out there and let the higher ups know i want to move into management . 
are you prepared?
i am prepared for it .   i ll be a lot happier once it is over . 
i bet .  good luck to you
i went to work the other day _comma_  and i was the only person in the office . 
where you supposed to be there? if so _comma_  then that is a nice feeling . 
yeah  _comma_   everyone else was just gone .   it was nice for a while  _comma_   but got a bit lonely . 
oh i see .  that could make the time go slow also .  
it did toward the end of the day for sure!
i am starting back at school next month .  i am excited about getting back into my classes . 
that s great .  what classes are you taking?
i m a computer science student .  the one i m most excited about is microprocessors . 
that s pretty cool .  are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming?
i want to be a software developer i think _comma_  so i like the programming . 
you should go all out and get a ee degree to go with it .   you can do microprocessor design . 
i really like school _comma_  so you never know what i might decide to go for next .  thank you for the advice . 
any time .  have a good weekend :d
my dog just died in my arms . 
did that happen tonight?
no _comma_  it was a few years ago . 
well _comma_  it must ve been something you said . 
my step daughter just turned    in the past week . 
did she have a party?
we re actually having it this coming weekend . 
does she have her license yet?
no  .   .   .  that s a long story involving her idiot father .   i m somewhat glad  _comma_   though  _comma_   as she can t seem to set her phone down . 
well  _comma_   there s no hurry in driving  _comma_   is there? what does she do mostly on her phone? text??
text    _comma_     video chat    _comma_     watch some goofball put makeup on    _comma_     and shop .   things most teenagers do    _comma_     i suppose . 
does she play any sports?
i watch my girlfriends dog every once in a while and she just isnt getting potty training .   she is a little over   months old and some weeks she does a great job and the next week she ll go to the bathroom everywhere but outside . 
that s super frustrating! i ve only ever had outside pets so i can t really offer advice _comma_  but it s one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can t really be upset with the dog since it doesn t know any better . 
i do understand that part too .   i actually got a puppy a couple months before her so i went through this all .   i just wish her puppy listened as well as mine because he took a couple months as has been doing great since .   i know it ll click eventually . i just wish shed hurry up :)
it ll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it _comma_  but urgh .  bathroom problems are why i don t think i want a kid anytime soon!
i was shocked by my present . 
you got a present? how lovely! what was the occasion?
it was my anniversary . 
well _comma_  happy anniversary! what was your present?
humanity is the worst . 
i agree .  did something happen?
no _comma_  just frustrated
i m sorry .  not everyone is bad .   just a lot of people . 
my mom spent a lot of money buying me a computer for my birthday
that was nice
yes _comma_  i love my mom and i will give her something even better for her birthday!
do you have anything in mind?
my old roommate never did any dishes .   he also didnt wash any food off the plates so we had a sink full of dirty dishes and rotting food at all time .   it was miserable living there . 
so _comma_  i take you left to live someplace else?
haha yes _comma_  i ended up saving up then moving out and buying my own place .   i wont miss the flies sitting around the kitchen and he s still just as messy . now its on his own though instead of with other people . 
just remember to never invite you ex roomate to your new place _comma_  ever!!!!!!
i recently tried to get a manager s job in my company _comma_  two others and myself were the last three in the running for the job . 
very nice _comma_  congrats on making it that far .  i actually was in the same situation about a week ago .   how do you feel you match up to the others?
i had much more experience than both of them _comma_  but ended up not getting the job .  i am still pretty upset about it . 
i would be upset too .   however _comma_  i wouldnt get discouraged though .   there may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon . 
my little brother graduated not too long ago .   he had to work hard but he made it through college
that s great _comma_  it s good to see people finish what they start .  you must be very proud . 
i was .   i know how hard it was for him so it was great seeing that hard work pay off in the long run . 
well _comma_  hopefully there will be nothing but great things for him in his future . 
my little brother graduated not too long ago .   he had to work hard but made it through it . 
i am so glad to hear that .   did he find a job?
he did!  he actually just started a new job that he loves and is related to his degree . 
that is good to hear .   what will he be doing?
my girlfriend is moving in this weekend .   it will be great finally living together . 
oh that s wonderful! how long have you two been dating?
we have been dating almost a year .   i m just excited to take this next step in the relationship . 
it s a huge step _comma_  congratulations! 
my girlfriends aunt just died .   she wasnt close to her but is still devastated because of the impact it had on her sister .   i m doing whatever i can to help them both . 
sometimes deaths affect us even when we re not really close . 
thats very true .   i know she feels bad for not keeping as close contact as she could have with her aunt now . 
guilt can be a terrible thing to live with . 
my friend and coworker hasnt been coming into work .   people are starting to talk but its hard to stick up for him when he only comes in once or twice a week . 
is he sick or just being lazy?
a little bit of both .   he has bad anxiety but he also has told me he just doesnt like going into work . 
i hope he can get the help he needs and maybe a job he enjoys more . 
one time during kindergarten _comma_  i peed myself because the teacher did not let me go to the restroom
oh _comma_  well that s awful on a little person! i never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom!
thanks! luckily i am potty trained now!
lol  _comma_   well  _comma_   that s good to know .  so am i!
one of my well knows patients that has horrible diabetes came in today for a follow up .  
is your patient improving an following good medical advice?
yes .  after   years of working with her she finally started to take her medication as prescribed as well as watch her carb and sugar intake .  i checked her blood sugar today and to my suprise it was normal!
that would be a surprise .   a lot of people are not dedicated enough to change their condition _comma_  especially those with diabetes . 
i agree! .  i was so proud of her and her test results surprised me! 
the first time my girlfriend slept over i farted on her leg in the middle of the night .   she knew it happened but didnt say anything .   she also doesnt know that i know . 
thats .  uh .  strange?
it was embarrassing but i think that she stayed with me is after is a good sign!
i think so _comma_  you re two peas in a pod . 
i m trying to get some work done and my dog just wants to play!  i love him to death but he needs to learn to be independent at times too!
pets are great  _comma_   but they can be a bit needy for attention at times .  it is great  _comma_   but not when you are busy and trying to get things done . 
thats very true .   after our first conversation i might have to take a break and play with him a bit .   i might have to log off and go on a sort walk to tire him out . 
a walk will definitely help .  he will probably be ready for a nap when you get back _comma_  then you can get some work done . 
one time when i was letting my cat outside _comma_  it ran out into the streets and got ran over
oh my god! that s terrible!
then i woke up _comma_  it was all a dream . 
oh that s so great!
my son just won first place at his championship swim meet!
that s amazing!  congratulations!  swimming can be tough
thank you! he takes to it like a fish in water .  haha!
lol i bet you use that line all the time!  i love it
one time when using the public restroom _comma_  i had toilet paper hanging from my shoe when i went outside
oh man! i hope no one noticed .  
unfortunately i kept getting looks! it s alright though!
i m glad that it all worked out!
i have a goal i want to get on here tonight but my dog really wants to play .   i feel bad that i m not playing with him but would really like to hit my goal before i do . 
oh _comma_  i bet you are really torn . 
i am _comma_  i would think i ll be done pretty soon and then take him for a nice long walk . 
i m sure he will love that .  i bet you will see the joy just shining in his eyes . 
my girlfriend broke up with me recently
that s one of the hardest parts of life .  what happened??
we drifted apart it seems
that is hard! relationships are hard work . 
a friend of mine drove me to work when my car broke down
that is great of them _comma_  did you do anything to pay them back?
i took him out to dinner later on _comma_  he s a good friend
that is nice of you _comma_  glad you have supportive friends!
i saw a mouse run across my kitchen floor
aw poor mouse .  i have had a few before . we actually rescued a few from our cat :  
i hope i can catch it at some point
they have live traps to catch and release that are only a couple bucks .  mice really are sweet natured . 
a co worker of mine was late with work materials
what happened to them?
i eventually got them _comma_  but it almost cost me this project i ve been working on
good  _comma_   sorry you were inconvenienced  _comma_   hope things get more consistent!
i was watching my girlfriends son the other weekend and was trying to think of an activity we could do together .   i decided on cooking and got everything before he came over . 
that sounds like fun .  for some reason kids really enjoy cooking . 
yeah _comma_  he seemed to have a good time .   we made cheese too which was a first for both of us .   it turned out pretty good too which was nice . 
that sounds like fun .  i want to try to make mozzerella
i am nervous for my college test
did you study for it at least?
i did but it is a law school exam .  you just never know . 
that is true _comma_  well best of luck to you friend!
i was walking around my office and someone spilled coffee on me
that is bad .  what did you do after that?
i went to the bathroom to clean up _comma_  it was a new shirt as well
did he say sorry?
when i came home _comma_  a tv show i had set to record was all ready to go
what show was it?
black mirror
is that the one with bryce dallas howard?
i keep remembering my old college days
oh? what about them?
just how fun and carefree they were . 
that s true .  any memory in particular?
i m spending my first summer in massachusetts .  it s a lot hotter than i expected it to be . 
is it really? how hot is it there?
the hottest it got was    degrees .  it has been in the mid   s mostly _comma_  but i was expecting cooler weather in new england . 
that is hot _comma_  but it is a bit hotter where i live here
i don t like it at all _comma_  but i can put up with it until fall . 
i was all alone when my family left for the weekend . 
did you feel lonely _comma_  or were you happy to have some time to yourelf?
a bit sad .  more bored than anything . 
that is tough when you re not used to being alone .   what did you end up doing?
i m looking forward to meeting with some friends on the weekend
oh that s cool!  what do you all have planned?
probably go hiking and visit some local towns
well that sounds like a fun little trip . 
after a long day i finally got my dog settled down and i dont have any work .   it feels nice to just sit for a little bit . 
thats nice to be able to relax
have you had a good day?  hopefully you dont have a busy weekend and can relax a little bit . 
everyday is a good day!
i feel ready for the coming work week
really? you must really like you job then
yeah _comma_  i think i have all my work materials set
good for you! i hope you  have good week!
i had an online interview today for a teaching position and i nailed it!
awesome! i am happy for you!
thanks! regardless i am a bit nervous .  there are a lot of things to remember and i don t want to look like a fool on the job . 
i am sure you will do fine! good luck!
i found out recently that my girlfriend s cat has cancer and we cannot afford the operation to remove it . 
oh i am so sorry .  best thing to do is be there for her . 
thank you for your sympathies .  have you ever dealt with losing a pet?
i have and it really hard .  it just takes time but a good support system makes it way better . 
i m happy to hear you were able to get through it over time . 
my girlfriend was having a bad day at work a few days ago . 
how did she handle it
well _comma_  i sent her some pizza and it was so unexpected it turned her whole day around!
well that was nice of you
i spent two hours studying material for an interview . 
did it help?
definitely .  i aced it _comma_  and now i m officially in a trial period!
congrats! i hope it works out
a while back _comma_  i intervened when i saw my dad was picking on my younger sister . 
that was good of you .   he didn t hurt her did he?
no _comma_  but he was just being mean .  so mean he decided to kick me out of the house . 
oh no!!! where did you end up going?
to my girlfriend s place .  luckily it only lasted a week _comma_  and my mom is super caring and loving .  she took me back in against his wishes . 
that was so awesome of your mom :)
walking home alone from school one day _comma_  three young adults jumped in front of me and yelled in my face . 
why did they do that?
for no good reason; there are evil people in this world .  i was so scared i cried on the way back home . 
that is terrible .  those days _comma_  a lot of people do stupid things . 
i wasn t sure how he would do since he didn t go to prek . 
children usually do really well _comma_  they are versatile .  
i have heard that _comma_  but now i truly believe that!
i hope he continues to do well . 
my daughter is officially all grown up she is leaving and going off to college next week .  
are you excited or will it be lonely? 
in between i am very positive that she will be ok but just the thought of your first born going into the real world away from you is scary a little but i know she will be just fine .  
yeah that is scary .  i am sure she will do great things though!
my kids was away all summer i missed them like crazy when they was gone . 
i bet it was really quiet and lonely .  did you find some time for yourself though?
a little to quite and i was very lonely i m glad it s over lol i started isolating my self to much when they was away .  
i don t think i would like that quiet either . 
i know i have high potential so the fact i failed my college course had me down . 
well that s not good .  i m sorry to hear that .  do you think maybe you were just too nervous during the test?
the test and the whole semester i just didn t give it my all like i should have and now i feel really crappy and regretful i need to redo course and give it my all . 
never be too confident! you ve got to give life your all at every step . 
some restaurants just have the worst workers they are so rude and mean to us the customers .  
i agree .  i dont know why they work in the service industry if they don t like to be nice
exactly what is even worse is the managers who are just as rude _comma_  i get so upset i had this happen to me at wendy s staff was so unprofessional .  
fast food employees are the worst sometimes .  it s like we bother them
i will officially be a first time home owner next month .  
how exciting!!!  i bet you are thinking already about  how you want to decorate it and fix up the lawn _comma_  etc . 
i am this is all i ever wanted for my family and it is about to come i am so thrilled with joy can t wait .  
i can imagine!  it is certainly an exciting time .   i bet you are just over the moon happy!
do you have any experience about it
any experience with what?
anything that made you happy
yes some things
can you share anything
i packed a sandwich before i went to work
are you trying to save money by not eating out at work?
yup _comma_  and i am too lazy to drive out to a restaurant!
well _comma_  it can save you a bunch of money!  plus you gain the time that you would normally spend going out somewhere and you can use that time to have more of a break . 
one time i saw poop smeared all over the public restroom
oh my! i bet you was so disgusted that you ran out of there .  
yup the smell was disgusting!
yikes! why in the world would somebody do that?
one time i looked at the mirror and thought i saw a monster
whoa! that is really scary! i ve felt weird sensations like that before . 
yeah .  unfortunately _comma_  it was a monster! i am just ugly!
no! i m sure you are not as monster ish as you think!
my mom spent a lot of money to buy me a computer
aw that s nnice of her
yup! she worked hard for like   weeks to save up for it! i love her!
moms are the best
one time while i was camping _comma_  there was a giant rattle snake trying to attack us
did you kill the snake?
nope! i packed up and went straight home!
that is too bad _comma_  will you ever camp again?
i had business meeting about a year ago where i had to rely a lot on my co worker . 
did they do a good job?
surprisingly they he did _comma_  i guess sometimes we i need to trust people . 
did you take them out for drinks after the meeting?
i had dumplings at a hotel yesterday _comma_  and for a hotel restaurant food they were actually good . 
sounds awesome
yes _comma_  it was a tasty lunch . 
i would have loved to do the same
i got into an argument the other day with my    year old son .   i still feel badly about it
did you resolve things?
yes eventually _comma_  but i am sorry to admit that i said things i should have never said to him out of anger . 
i hope you can get over that pain . 
thanks _comma_  me too .   i should have remained calm and not called him names and say things i didnt mean . 
one time i bought a scratch lottery ticket and won    !
that s awesome! it would be amazing to win a million one day .  one can dream . 
yup _comma_  i am going to buy another one just because of you! i hope i win!
that s great .  i hope you do! maybe this time you can get     .  but gamble only in moderation!
i was upset when my family kept leaving me on vacation
that is really upsetting!
it was .  i just wanted some quality family time . 
well forget them! if they don t care about you you don t need to care about them
my cousin and i used to beat eachother with sticks . 
for fun?
yeah .  we called it the box game and walked around inside of a refrigerator box for protection . 
well that sounds pretty fun!
i was very well prepared for my law exam . 
were you satisfied with the results?
i was!   %
excellent!
i enthusiastically told my family about everything wrong with my life at that point . 
how did it go
not good .  i was very drunk though
oh well maybe next time
quitting smoking was so much easier than i expected it to be!
how many days has it been?
  years
wow thats great!
i was grossed out when i saw someone vomit outside a bar . 
drunk people can get pretty disgusting in general . 
for sure .  it was not a pretty sight . 
some people can t hold their liquor . 
life is a lot better when you can eat solid food .  never get your jaw wired shut it sucks . 
i can imagine .  what happend that you got your jaw wired?
i got punched while drunk without a mouth guard years ago   still think about it !
man that sounds aweful . 
life is good right now for me too
nice .   always feels good to be at the top knowing nothing can t touch you
right just staying active  _comma_   don t need much money  _comma_   minimal drama .  easy
absolutely
i used to feel lonely a lot as a teenager .  that was dumb of me
i feel like everyone goes through that phase .   i know i did too
i ve noticed that it s easier to be happy while not around someone all the time . 
would you say you re more of an introvert?
august is way too hot . 
especially in the south
right .  i live as north as you re gonna get in the us and it still sucks . 
oh wow _comma_  that does sound horrible
ged test was super easy .  i was confident that i would pass it
did you find out the results?
yeah i crushed
dang thats awesome!
two years ago i decided to go back to school after working at my job for    years .  at the time i was very nervous about my decision . 
oh wow and you couldn t keep your job? what were you going to school for?
i still work there _comma_  but just part time now .  i am studying computer science . 
oh wonderful! one of the best fields to be in right now
i love it .  just ten more classes to go until i finish . 
wow! good luck _comma_  there are so many things you can do with that degree and from home too!
thank you! i hope to work from home . 
my grandparents have been married for    years i hope to be like that one day . 
that is awesome .  i never even get a second date a husband may not be in the cards lol
lol you just haven t came across the right person yet .  it is incredible i arranged and had them a surprise dinner party it turned out very nice . 
thats sweet .  i bet they enjoyed it
here in florida the traffic and wrecks is bad and always happening .  
i hate bad traffic _comma_  did you get in an accident?
due to a reckless driver running the red light _comma_  but most wrecks i have witnessed come from careless drivers or drivers driving slow in the fast lane and get tail ended i get so irritated i swear .  
that s the worst _comma_  i hate when people are careless . 
i get so angry when people stand me up it s so rude . 
i know what you mean
my coworker did this recent we was suppose to have lunch she didn t call or anything .  
that sucks .  have you talked to her?
seen her at work but she has been avoiding me even more rude but never again will i plan an outing with her .  
professional settings is suppose to get along and be great but not my place of work staff fight like cats and dogs there .  
that is awful .   i agree .   a professional setting is supposed to be  .  well _comma_  professional .   what steps are being taken to correct that?
we have a team building coming up and let s hope this works which i predict it will be some type of good outcome .  
i agree .   i hope it will be .   team building  _comma_   communication  _comma_   and professionalism will all help a company .   i think this is why so many companies fail .   
i just drove    hours back from my parents  house .  it wasn t so bad though _comma_  because i actually packed everything i needed for once .  i was able to minimize the amount of stops i took and cut two hours off of the total time it took!
wow _comma_  you do really live far from your parents .  do you go to college or work?
i work .  we moved far from where they grew up when i was young _comma_  and they ended up moving back for retirement .  
i see .  well _comma_  it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past .  nostalgia probably helps them cope with passing life
i was pretty bummed to find out that my favorite coworker is transferring to a different department . 
i can see how that would be a downer .   will you still get to see them?
once in a while _comma_  here and there . 
at least they aren t gone completely _comma_  but i can understand how that would affect your day to day work life . 
i prequalified for a mortgage last week online .  the bank i applied with has called me   times a day ever since .  i m getting pretty frustrated . 
i would be really annoyed myself _comma_  why so many frequent calls ?
i m not sure .  this is my first time shopping for a mortgage _comma_  so i m not sure if it s normal or not . 
i know ever since i purchased a new car  _comma_   i know for a fact i did not read the fine print but insurance companys call me almost every day multiple times a day   _comma_   its really annoying 
i watched wimbledon for the first time last summer .  those tennis players are so good!
i know right! my parents love tennis _comma_  so i grw up watching it . 
i had played a little bit growing up _comma_  but never watched it professionally .  
were you ever any good at it?
it was so life like and i have such fond memories of playing in there .   my stepdad worked for pillsbury and brought home dough and i would pretend i was baking . 
good for you to have such memorable experience to have and remember of .  can you bake now for real?
yes somewhat _comma_  although with all that practice in childhood i should be much better .    i miss my stepdad so much .    i have nothing but fond memories of him . 
are you still in contact with him?
i looked at a house i really liked last week _comma_  but just found out it was taken off the market . 
oh that sucks .  i hate when that happens . 
yeah _comma_  it ll be okay though .  there s always something else that will come available . 
i bet the next house you look at will be amazing and even better than that one . 
i had to drive    hours straight last week .  for once it wasn t terrible _comma_  because i packed everything i needed .  took two hours fewer than it normally does!
that sounds exhausting! were you driving for work or just taking a vacation?
vacation .  went to go visit my parents . 
i m sure the drives worth it since you get to spend time with the family . 
i came home from work _comma_  expecting an empty apartment .  my boyfriend was home from his trip a day early!
was he alone?
yes _comma_  i was very excited to see him . 
cool .  did you do something special?
i got a promotion at work! i m so excited!
congrats
thank you!
do you get a raise?
my bank has called me three times a day for the past week _comma_  and i m tired of it . 
probably they noticed some irregular or even fraudulent activities associated with your account
no  _comma_   i prequalified for a mortgage  _comma_   and they ve been wanting me to speak to a loan specialist ever since . 
are you interested in mortgage for now?
my roommate leaves her leftovers in the fridge for a disgusting amount of time . 
oh that is really gross! have you talked to her about it?
no _comma_  i don t feel like it s my place to tell her what to do . 
if you share the fridge _comma_  i d let her know if it causes an odor or might affect the other food . 
i came home expecting an empty apartment _comma_  but my boyfriend had come home a day early from his trip!
cool .  did he have gifts?
no _comma_  but i m not big on gifts . 
oh .  i am lol
do you feel anything like that
like what? bad or miserable?
sad _comma_  when you see beggar in the street
yes indeed .  seeing people less fortunate than me makes go to pieces
what do you think when you see them
next month my wife and i are going on our first vacation _comma_  i can hardly wait . 
wow .  enjoy your own time . 
i will _comma_  it is going to be great to get away together . 
yeah _comma_  you re right .  hope you ve memorable vacation . 
my ex boyfriend and i started having trouble getting along and we were under a lot of stress over money .    after awhile of this he started putting a password on his cell phone so i couldnt get in to see his messages .   that was the first sign!
wao _comma_ thats really not cool
no _comma_  not cool at all .   we ended up breaking up for a bit and he didnt waste any time before seeing this girl .    i wasted four years of my life for that to happen .    
he doesnt deserve you _comma_ so wipe your tears
i found myself suddenly by myself and it seemed as if all the people i had become friends with were no longer wanting to still be friends .   i mostly met all of them through him when we got together _comma_  and when he left me he told them not to speak to me anymore and they listened . 
that s sad .  but i m sure they stil want to be firends with you too
i dont think they do .   he was an abusive guy and he didnt want me to have them as friends and he would make up lies about me  .   i dont think it was so much the lies he made up because they knew they were not true .   i think they were just loyal to him . 
posibly .  sounds like you are better off without him though
i love it when the buildbuilding is comingfrom me
that s awesome _comma_  i wish i could build my own house . 
is the conversation over? you are welcome then . 
well thank you as well . 
her name was lily and she was a pit bull _comma_  my favorite breed .    i loved her so much .   we did everything together .   she would go wherever i did . 
did she die recently?
no she had to go to the humane society when my ex boyfriend and i broke up .    i had no choice  _comma_   and he did it just to hurt me .   lily would go swimming with me  _comma_   ride on our boat etc .   when she was just a pup she would sit on my lap as i rode the four wheeler .  
oh wow! thats so sad _comma_  i know animals can be like kids to use .  i m so sorry
he was originally suspended at    when he again got got with a little bit of weed .   they have a law here in missouri called    and under law .   automatically get suspended for a year if ur a minor in possession . 
that can ruin a persons life . 
i know it can which is why i was so worried at court .   the judge looked at him and said son you need to hire you a lawyer .   i  throw people in jail for things like this . 
that is such a mess . 
the best thing happened at work today!
tell me more _comma_  sounds exciting! 
well we have these weekly meetings about our goals and today i was recognized by name in front of everyone for a job well done . 
good on you! you finally got recognition for your hard work
ugh! tonight was such a bummer . 
oh no what happened?
i was going to go to a concert but couldn t get myself to go by myself at the last minute .  i feel like i m going to regret not going . 
what concert was it?
it was an annual block party we have here with a local lineup of musicians .  i really liked the lineup!
that probably would have been fun . 
the aftermath was awful .   trash and debris was everywhere and we were homeless .   we lived out in the country and it took some time before red cross came out to do their report and get help to us . 
that sounds terrible .  i hope you re okay now . 
i am doing better now but it was really hard times .   we had moved everything up higher as we never expected our whole house to go .   unfortunately we had all our belongings in the house as well . 
well all the matters is that no one was hurt .  you can buy property again but not lives . 
i ordered a new phone last week _comma_  and when the box got here it was empty . 
that is so messed up!
yeah  _comma_   i was pretty upset  _comma_   especially when they initially refuse to refund my money . 
i would be so angry . 
a few years back i had to bury my dog _comma_  who had died at the age of    . 
oh wow _comma_  what kind of dog was it? i m so sorry that must ve been super hard
he was a lab .   it broke my heart _comma_  to be honest . 
i can imagine .  i haven t had an animal die yet but my cat is    and i m dreading the day
i thought i would never get the chance or opportunity to better my life as well as my childrens .   i cant wait till i get that degree
that s wonderful that you are pursuing a degree .  what is it in?
i am getting a counseling degree to help abused women .   i feel i would make a good counselor since i  have been in a few abusive relationships myself . 
that is great that you have been able to overcome and do this to help others .  you can really make a difference! 
i saw a video game trailer recently that really brought me back!
yeah? which game was it for?
the new spyro remastered game coming out .  seeing it really reminded me of how i used to play the original all day with an old friend of mine . 
nice .  the original spyro is a classic . 
i had a flat on the way to work this morning _comma_  and the jack handle was missing from my car . 
oh no .  what did you do?
i used a screwdriver to work the jack .  it sucked _comma_  lol . 
lol _comma_  well done for attempting it .  did you make it to work on time?
yep _comma_  with   minutes to spare .  (no pun intended)
i just celebrated my birthday and it was so much better than usual . 
that s great .  what made it so special this year?
i usually don t do much to celebrate but this year a friend of mine got all my other friends together to throw a party for me without me knowing .  it was a great time . 
sounds like fun! i m glad you had a happy birthday . 
my wife and i have tried to have a baby for over three years  _comma_   and had given up hope .   two weeks ago  _comma_   we found out she was pregnant . 
i am so happy for you! congrats!
thank you!  we were both pretty shocked by the news _comma_  lol . 
i wish you nothing but the best!
i was in an extremely dangerous abusive relationship at the time and i knew he was intending to put her in the middle of it all .    he intended to use her for leverage over me  . 
it sounds like you re talking about two different people there instead of just one person .   i m a little confused . 
oh my i am getting ahead of myself .   i was referring to when i had to put my daughter emerson up for adoption in      .   
ouch that sucks .  i m sorry to hear that . 
ugh! my friend is definitely getting on my nerves today . 
why what happened? are y all on a trip?
we made plans to catch up but never set a time .  i tried to contact him to figure out what time and he never got back to me .  i was looking forward to catching up . 
oh wow _comma_  so he basically ghosted you? i would be mad too
yes _comma_  i pray not to be found or trapped like they trapped me to stab unknown man . 
that sounds very bizarre . 
serious _comma_  that has being my worse situation so far
i hope you are okay . 
my car window was broken when i walked up to my car this morning!
that is so messed up!
yeah it is! im going to have to spend money i didnt have .  im so upset right now . 
i hope this doesn t happen again . 
i agree .  i have never felt this frusterated in a long time! i should go for a walk
i really felt like a fool last night . 
oh my  _comma_   what did you do  _comma_   may i ask?
i was playing a board game with a few friends and i ended up spilling my entire drink all over the table .  
that does not sound good .  it must have been so embarrassing!
work was not a good experience today . 
oh no _comma_  what happened?
i had to explain how a bunch of things work in front of a lot of people .  i m not a fan of talking in front of a crowd . 
i hate public speaking too!
when i moved to dallas i felt i would have the time of my life after living in a small town _comma_  but after a couple of weeks i got homesick . 
dallas is a really fast city . 
yeah it is .  i dont know anybody and my classmates all have jobs .  so i get to be at home by myself alot
i m sorry _comma_  things will get better . 
thank you .  i wish i havd more friends here .  
i m really excited about this weekend!
what are your plans?
a friend of mine has been out of the country for a year and he has finally come back .  we re going to catch up . 
thats aweosme! is he going to be staying with you?
yep _comma_  we have all weekend to hangout!
so my sister drove my car to run an errand and got a ticket! she doesnt have her license
that is terrible .  what happened then?
well not much .  its just i feel bad because i told her i would take her but got so busy .  maybe im the one that should have got the ticket .  not her
i understand .  my mistaske always happened . 
i agree .  its my fault she will have this fine .  i will have to pay it for her now  .  
financial troubles are sometimes the worst! ugh . 
those are so stressful .  just take it step by step and you can get on track .  
you really have to .  luckily _comma_  my family was able to help me out and get me back on my feet .  it s definitely nice to have people who are willing to help . 
that makes all the difference .  i am glad you were able to get out of that position .  
so my brother will be the first out of   kids of my parents to have a baby and today is going to be the gender revealing party .  
you must be really excited for it! do you think its going to be girl or boy?
we all want a boy so we are all cant wait to find out what it is .  everyone is so impatient about it _comma_  but today is the day . 
well _comma_  it will great either way as long as the baby is healthy! 
i agree! .  i cant wait to get there to find out .  lol
i m looking forward to how chill this weekend will be . 
do you plan do something this weekend?
quite the opposite _comma_  really .  i just paid all my bills and have not really any plans .  sometimes it s nice to just not have that stress and relax . 
yes .  it is sometime nice to just rest at home . 
so this year will be the first time i been to a haunted house .  im get scared easilty so im kinda worried .  i promised my friend i would go with her .  
that sounds like fun do you know who haunts it?
i dont know  _comma_   but i feel i should not go  _comma_   but again i promised my friend i would go .  i dont know wha to do now .  
well _comma_  if you promised i would try to go .  i m sure it ll be fine .  
i agree .  i will think about it for now .  i m very scared something will happen so im debating .  
me and this girl have been dating for awhile now _comma_ so i think im going to ask her to be my girlfriend .  
nice! you must be pretty confident she will say yes . 
yes i agree .  i feel that way about it .  you know me too well .  
i hope it goes well for you and brings happiness to you both . 
thank you .  i hope she dont say no _comma_  but i can bet you she says yes .  
my sister s cat got sick and had to be put down last week .  feels bad . 
that sounds terrible .  but hopefully it isnt suffering any more .  
she had stomach cancer _comma_  so she was in a lot of pain .  definitely the right thing to do
i agree _comma_  just remember her for all the good memories .  
i have a huge exam coming up tomorrow . 
have you been studying? that is intimidating but i bet you ll do great! what s the subject?
it s for a pc architecture class .  i m feeling really good about it though since i studied really hard all week!
what an interesting course! i hope you do really well .  exams can be so scary  they can cause such anxiety .  
there are maggots all over my building s garbage bin this morning .  i got one on my arm when i walked by
that is very bad .  did you complaint to the landlord?
they don t care .  they live upstairs and are very dirty people .  i m moving as soon as i get a job!
i understand .  the best thing is to move . 
coming home driving in the rain my car hydroplaned on the freeway!
that s awful! i m always scared that s going to happen to me when it s raining
i agree and thank god i was the only car on the freeway  _comma_  otherwise it would be a different story!
you got lucky for sure!  i can t imagine how scary that would be
yah im very thankful to be here right now! whew!
i m amazed on how many people came to the parade considering the rain!
really _comma_  where was this parade at? i m in missouri and it was absolutely pouring on friday
i m here down south and it has been pouring as well _comma_  but that didnt stop people from coming! im shocked .  
i usually don t let a little rain stop me unless it s ridiculous!
i agree! they even brougth their kids! its so baffling!
i just saw a commercial about the rescue animals .  everytime i see it it makes me so sad .  
oh no .  feeling empathy towards them just shows you re normal .  there s a lot of people in your boat
yea .  it reminds me of my old dog that was a rescue .  so many memories .  i want to go get one actually .  
whats preventing you?
i started nursing school and work full time _comma_  so i wont give much time to it .  i want it to be a happy dog .  
you sound too kind .  you d be a great dog mother father!
thank you! im gonna have to not see them commercials anymore _comma_  otherwise i will cry 
i love mystery boxes in games! unfortunately i usually don t get anything good . 
that sounds fun!  what are they exactly?
almost any game that has an online component! like right now i play the secret world and it has mystery boxes . 
it sounds like you really enjoy it!  good for you!
so i will be going to see my mom after   years of not seeing her since starting school! i cant wait
how exciting! she must be thrilled too
yes she is .  we are all so excited to finally hang out! we have so much planned
i hope you guys have the best time!
thank you! we will make the best of it !
so the role i worked so hard for went to a person who could care less about the play! 
that unfortunate .   are you feeling a little jealous?
i guess you can say that! what a day!
i hate it when stuff like that happens .  
i agree .  maybe i will act like him next time .  
haha _comma_  nooooo .  don t do that .    there are too many of those people in the world as it is . 
yeah your right .  i will stick to my little envious rant and go about my day
sounds like the best course to me :)
once _comma_  i went camping with my family .  we saw many animals and a beautiful creek .  it was a happy time . 
that sounds so great .  being in nature makes you feel so good .  
it does! i really hope we get to go camping again this fall . 
you should just make a plan and do it .  it sounds like it is worthwhile .  
we order chinese food last .  the order was completely wrong but the lady seemed very helpful when we called . 
that sucks _comma_  sorry to hear that .  did you get a refund?
we didn t get a refund but they were able to fix the order .  i was really craving chinese!
hopefully they get your order correct the next time you order there!
i ate a lot of my kid s halloween candy .  i told her the candy was old and i had to throw it away . 
did it taste good?
it was really good! she had a lot of candy .  i was hoping she wouldn t notice some missing!
did it taste good?
yes it did!
two weeks back i celebrated my birthday and do you know what my office colleagues planed for me
were you suprised that they did this for you?
yes and i am quiet happy that they also brought my wife who stays in london for party to surprise me
wow! how happy you must be .  i be that day brought you lost of excitement .  
yes it took me with a surprise how well my colleagues planned for me
you must have great co workers .  i bet your happy everyday you go to work
so my childhood dog died last week .  my mother called me with the news .  
oh so sad  _comma_  what happened to it
he died of old age .  he could barely walk so they put him down .  yeah pretty bad news .  it made my day blue
it must must a very much hard time for you and your family 
yes it is .  he is in a better place now .  
yes  _comma_  he be rest in peace
we went camping in the mountain .  we did not know it was bear season .  there were a lot of hunters and hunting dogs in the area .  they were chasing the bears into one area
i would be so scared .  i think i might have to leave .  did the bears bother anyone?
luckily _comma_  the hunters kept them around a mile from camp .  it was still very hard to sleep! we heard dogs barking at the bears all night!
were you in a tent or a camper? i hope you kept your food locked up tightly . 
we were in a tent and all of food was in a yeti! i made sure everyone put their food away and burned leftovers in the fire . 
glad everyone is safe! you were very smart . 
we had a doberman for over   years .  he passed away last spring .  it was a hard time for our family . 
oh _comma_  i m so sorry to hear that .  i know pets can be like one of the family .  
they are like having another child! i hope to have another doberman one day .  they re really good dogs . 
you should adopt a rescue dog .  that would be great for the family .  
that s a great idea!
last week i visited a restaurant and found a insect in the burger which i ordered
that s disgusting .  what did you do about it?
i immediately raised an alarm about the issue and complained to store manager
did you get a refund at least? i would never visit that restaurant ever again if i were you!
yes they provided me a     dollar gift card too
we have homeschooled our daughter for the past   years .  this year _comma_  she has decided to return to public school . 
that s interesting! most kids love being home schooled but i guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers . 
she did miss having a lot of friends .  i hope she does well .  she starts in    days!
not too much longer! i hope she adjusts well and enjoys herself .  public school can still provide an enriching experience when it comes to social skills and education . 
this will be my last semester in college! i cant wait to finish . 
wow good job! so close
thanks! .  i get so happy everytime i think about it!
thats a great accomplishment
i agree .  my family will be proud of me! 
since i moved to dallas i have not met any friends .  i go to work and school and just come home .  
maybe you should job a club or a social gatherings group
i agree .  it gets boring at home alone with no one .  
i agree .  you need to socialize a little bit to get out of your lonely slump
i agree .  this weekend it is! 
that should be fun .  good luck!
my sister lives in utah .  we had planned for her to come visit but her work would not allow her to take the time off . 
aw that s annoying .  work always gets in the way of things .  did you ever try to go to her?
i haven t yet .  i would like to eventually .  i m hoping to see her soon
i m sure it will work out! not this time unfortunatly _comma_  but it will in the end
so i was out of town this weekend and lent my brother my car .  i was hesitant at first _comma_  but i felt he would do good with it and take care of it .  
did he take care of it for you?
he did .  i feel i can let him use it more often after this .  
that is great that he was able to show you he is responsible .  i bet you re proud .  
yes i am .  i can know rest assure that he will do good .  
my husband works very hard so that i can be a stay at home mom .  it has allowed me the freedom to homeschool our daughter . 
that s awesome _comma_  what does your hubster do?
he owns an auto repair shop .  he works from sun up to sun down!
wow _comma_  i admire his dedication! and you won t ever have to worry about your vehicle breaking!
that s is the number one perk of having a mechanic for a husband!
so my   year review at work is coming up and i feel its going to be good since i wokred so hard .  
hard work pays off in the long run .  if your work is truly authentic in its nature _comma_  it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated
i agree .  i think my raise will be good as well as the promotion i asked for .  
be careful while negotiating your pay raise .  some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them
sounds like a plan! she has noticed my work  _comma_  so im confident it will work out well .  
my child sneaked in my room to get the xbox controller while i was sleeping .  the night before _comma_  i had grounded her . 
oh no _comma_  do you think she was trying to get back at you for grounding her?
i think she thought she could play a few minutes of minecraft and then return the controller before i woke up! i caught her getting into the drawer where i hid it . 
i definitely remember trying something like that when i was a kid .   i think sometimes kids think they re sneakier than they actually are . 
my friend came to my house drunk and threw up everywhere .  
whow!  that sounds really disgusting!  what did you do?
yes it was! i could not do nothing .  she was in a raging fit .  ijust made she she went to sleep ok .  
man _comma_  you are a good friend!  i would have been beyond angry!
i am! i m more grossed out about it than anything!
my friends mother got diagnosed with cancer last month and its been hard on her .  
so sorry to hear that .  it is truly horrifying and i wish and hope for nobody to be hit with this calamity
yeah .  shes my best friend _comma_  so i m planning to go with her this weekend to see her mom .  my heart breaks for her . 
indeed .  friends should be together in times of need .  that is what friends are for
i agree! thank you!
last week i did a presentation at work and as i stood up i blew some gas!
oh no!! did anyone notice? it s normal though _comma_  we all do that sometimes
yes it was loud .  i can feel my face turn red and the room getting quiet!
oh man .  it happened to me before _comma_  i know how embarrassing it is . 
yes it was .  ugh!
so my little brother barely passed his finals to become a cop! i could not beleive it .  
that s great that he passed though!  are you happy about it?
im very happy _comma_  but all he do through school was party and never study .  im shocked .  
well at least he passed   that s great!
yes it is .  im happy for him . !
we went to the library where they had an animal expert stop by for the kids .  my daughter was able to answer most of his questions that other kids could not .  it made me smile . 
that is pretty neat actually .  i wish i had kids to bring to stuff like that . 
you should check your local library .  the ones in my area have tons of things  _comma_   like a lego club  _comma_   for the local kids . 
i will do that _comma_  i had no idea . 
my dad died of cancer in      .  that was really hard for me emotionally . 
i m really sorry to hear that . 
thank you .  i was prepared _comma_  but it was still difficult . 
i can t even imagine to be honest . 
i hope you don t have to go through it for a long time . 
i have lost grandparents and greatparents but they were all older in age so it was easier to deal with . 
it s always tough _comma_  even if someone is older . 
i m sure it will be different when it s a parent . 
i have a performance review and potential promotion coming up in the next few weeks . 
that s awesome! i hope you will get a promotion .  what do you do for work?
i work as an accountant for a carpet cleaning company .  there is a chance that i could be made a manager!
you will be a great manager! good luck with everythig
i just hired a new hotel inspector _comma_  he has very little experience but wants to learn .  scares me . 
you took a risk huh? i hope he will be a great worker! that s good you gave him a chance
yes _comma_  i need more staff member and he was very nice .  but if he does a bad job i get fired . 
i hope it won t happen! 
in high school _comma_  i fell down the stairs in front of my crush .  my face turned red and i ran away!
oh no! did he say anything about it?
he laughed at me .  looking back  _comma_   i m sure it was funny but in the moment  _comma_   i could have died!
i know what you mean .  i ve done stuff like that too   you do feel a bit silly _comma_  don t you!
last night i won a gift card at trivia night at the pub .  going shopping today . 
awesome! what are you planning on buying?
i ve got a baby due in december so something for the baby or my wife .  i never bother getting my self anything . 
maybe you can figure out a way to get all three of you guys something!
i found out my wife was dating someone else a year before we got married _comma_  we were together for   years at that point .  today i m stressed!
oh no that is crazy!
yea _comma_  we have a baby due in december so i m trying to not jump to any decisions to quickly . 
well i m sorry you are going through this and i hope you can figure it all out .  
thanks _comma_  everything happens for a reason .  
i woke up one morning to make a sandwich .  the smell of the sandwich meat made me sick! i felt something was wrong and drove to the nearest store .  i purchased a pregnancy test . 
i hate those things _comma_  i try to not eat those at all . 
i usually love eating sandwiches which is why i knew something just wasn t right! i was experiencing morning sickness!
i eat steak and shrimp . 
i have a friend that will not stop talking about himself .  he always wants to talk about his latest investments  _comma_   the books he has read  _comma_   and how much he knows about the places that he visits!
i really dislike snooty people who are constantly rubbing their amazing life in your face . 
i do too .  it makes me not want to be around those types of people . 
i wouldn t be friends with someone like that .  i mean what can you benefit from that friendship?
exactly! i should really stop hanging out with him . 
agreed .  you really won t be missing out on anything worthwhile . 
i am a big taylor swift friend! 
i love taylor swift! she s talented and beautiful!
yes i need to arrive at her concert tonight at   !
how exciting for you! have fun!
i know i studied well _comma_  but i can t stop worrying about it .  
you have a test coming up?
yes on friday .  it is the final . 
well i hope you do well! good luck . 
she had a lot  of friends that came . 
that s interesting .  what was she doing?
she had her birthday at chuck e cheese . 
that s awesome! i didn t know that place was still in business .  
i love to coupon but sometimes i feel like the cashiers aren t trained properly .  they will look at the coupon for every detail and do not understand the language in the fine print . 
yeah i bet it is frustrating .  the store gets reimbursed for the coupons so they should not nitpick . 
i agree .  it s not like the money will come out of their paycheck if something is wrong!
i hope they get better training so you don t have to argue with them about it
the cop said he was too old!
too old for what? what a strange thing to say . 
too old to give him a ticket for reckless driving! 
that doesn t make much sense .  maybe i am missing the context . 
that s what i thought! 
i played a game of poker with a friend who had no idea what he was doing .  i won about      from him that night . 
oh no _comma_  he shouldn t have gambled .  
you are probably right! i felt bad when i was spending the money .  i hope he didn t really need it . 
i would ve too _comma_  but sometimes people need to learn a lesson . 
this is very true!
recently there have been a few break ins . 
oh no! did you property get broken into? or your neighbor s property?
no _comma_  my neighbor did but that s close enough for me! 
for real! are you taking any precautions?
one time i saw a stray dog walking around a restaurant looking for food
inside the restaurant ? what kind of place was this ?
it was outside a fried chicken chain restaurant
okay _comma_  that makes more sense then to me . 
we made sure to board up for the hurricane coming . 
where are you located ?
we are in miami _comma_  florida   mile from the beach .   . 
i wasn t even aware there was a hurricane . 
the cop said i will probably never find out who did it .  
who did what?
i wont find out who the person was that hit my car while i was sleeping . 
oh i m so sorry to hear that .  people are so inconsiderate!
my sons teacher isn t very nice to the young kindergartners .  
oh no! why not?!
not  _comma_   sure  _comma_   but she is not very nice at all . 
i would make a complaint to the principal if i were you!
i may never know who she was . 
never know who was?
the women that hit my car and left before the police came . 
wow that is aweful! 
i agree .  and the cop said i will probably have to pay for my own damage! 
near my house  _comma_   there is an abandoned school that is said to be haunted .  when i was a teenager  _comma_   a group of friends and i decided to go check it out . 
oh wow _comma_  what happened?
when we pulled up _comma_  it was very spooky .  i didn t even want to get out of the car! a few of my friends tried to get in but it was boarded up .  i looked in the window and there was still writing on the chalkboards!
that would give me the creeps! has anyone seen anything there?
there are stories about ghosts of children walking through the hallways and that you can hear laughing .  we didn t see or hear anything supernatural but it was still scary!
i bet it was .  i ve only had one creepy experience   that was in an old house in west virginia .  i m very careful to avoid those places these days!
my hair has always been long and i had been scared to have a short hair cut .  last december _comma_  i finally took the plunge and cut off all of my hair . 
good for you! there is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair . 
that s what i have discovered! i get a lot of compliments on it and i feel really good about myself when i go out!
great! i m glad that it worked out well for you!
i recently drove back to my hometown and went to the towns fair _comma_  it felt so nice reliving my childhood . 
that s awesome  _comma_   i went to visit my parents and my hometown last month  _comma_   it is a great feeling .   how was the fair?
it was great _comma_  it didn t change much but it still has that  soul  to it .  just felt great looking at it honestly . 
brings back all the memories you had as a kid .   i miss going to the state fair _comma_  was always fun . 
when i was in high school  _comma_   i dated a guy for almost a year .  a few weeks before summer  _comma_   he broke up with me and started seeing another girl . 
you must have been sad and angry . 
i was .  i would get really mad when i saw them at lunch or after school together .  i was my first experience with heart break . 
yes first heart brake is so hard  _comma_   i feel for you  _comma_   something similar happened to me with my first boyfriend . 
this was my first time winning a contest on the raido!
that s awesome! congratulations!
thanks! i will get to go free to the taylor swift concert tonight! 
no way! that s actually a super awesome prize! have fun
i bought extra items during school lunch in high school .  i have a negative balance on my account . 
ouch _comma_  hopefully its not by much .  i remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation .  they re usually pretty lenient on it . 
i had to take money out of my dad s wallet to cover it .  i would have got in so much trouble with my parents for buying candy! it wasn t much but i still felt bad . 
i m sure your dad wouldn t mind haha _comma_  its usually pretty cheap anything i remember they cost like    . 
i had a roommate in my dorm who didn t clean up his dorm room at the end of the semester and the school fined me and the other two roommates      .  i was furious at that guy . 
did you try to get the money from him? he sounds like a pretty bad person . 
yeah we tried but he cut all communication _comma_  he didn t respond to his phone number or anything .  i hope he got fined a larger amount so it teaches him a lesson on laziness .  
i do too! people like that make me never want to have a roommate! 
so i recently traveled to cuba to see some friends and we went to a bar until   am _comma_  and as we were walking back there were these   guys hiding in the shadows .  we got so scared we started running but thankfully they didn t follow . 
oh wow .  that s pretty scary .  i would be horrified . 
yeah it was quite an experience _comma_  my friends said those are usually drunk people who stay up the whole night talking with people .  but they looked like they wanted to do more than talk!
well _comma_  at least they didn t follow you .  how is cuba? my parents are from there but i ve never been . 
its great  _comma_   very beautiful and amazing culture (and food!) .  just don t drive if you go  _comma_   they seriously drive like maniacs haha
i raised   chickens since they were babies .  i was trying to let them free range but i forgot to put them back in their coop for the night .  a predator was able to get to them . 
oh no! that s sad _comma_  did he get them all?
yes _comma_  it did! i think it was a dog that always gets out of our neighbor s yard . 
aw  _comma_   that s too bad  _comma_   hopefully next time they will be safe in the coop!
i was looking through old clothes that i was giving away and found     in one of the back pockets .  made me very happy lol
wow _comma_  so what are you going to do with it?
oh i just put it into a little piggy bank i have _comma_  trying to get to      to cop some yeezys that are coming out in october .  hope i get a pair!
nice _comma_  i hope that works out for you .  good luck
i was watching youtube and saw this guy eat a jellyfish straight out of the ocean .  looked like the most disgusting thing someone could eat . 
that is gross _comma_  i can t even imagine what that would taste like!
he said it had the texture of hard rubber and tasted of pure algae and just dead stuff .  he even ate another one that he pan fried and it was all green and moldy . 
that s so gross _comma_  i would take a hard pass on eating that .  i like seafood but that s too much . 
one of my friends jumped from the roof of his house to the pool and somehow made it  _comma_   it was like     feet of distance  _comma_   really amazing stuff . 
omg _comma_  thankfully he wasn t hurt .  
yeah i was really nervous that he was gonna get hurt since he likes to do stupid dares .  it was quite the experience . 
did yall happen to get it on video? 
no sadly _comma_  nobody had their phones with them at the moment .  but theres plenty of videos on youtube showing what happens if you dont make it!
my older brother is getting married friday . 
congrats! _comma_  i m sure you must be very happy!
i am very happy for him! i thought it was never going to happen!
haha brotherly love _comma_  i hope him and the lucky gal have a wonderful life together!
having a kid can be one of the most happy moments in a person s life .  i cannot express how much happiness my daughter has brought to us since she was born . 
thats amazing i cant wait to have my own one day
it can be hard but it s one of the best experiences that i have had in life . 
i bet so!
im nervous for the new week to begin
is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week?
very busy and lots of traveling
that can be stressful .  i am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you! just remember that the weekend is only   days away! 
i spent    minutes looking for my car keys while my friends waited outside and they were in my pockets the whole time .  my friends made sure i never forgot that moment haha
we all do stuff like that .  at least you didn t lock them inside your car .  done that before!
oh thankfully i ve never had to go through that yet .  that one would really suck!
yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright .  haha . 
i told her i had to work because i didn t want to go see a movie tonight . 
did you not want to go out _comma_  or did you just not like the movie?
i was tired and wanted to get in bed early _comma_ 
just be careful with that .  if you feel tired due to stress _comma_  it may be the stress talking and not you . 
had my finals last week _comma_  studied really hard for them .  felt so nice walking into that room so confident and calm
great _comma_  when will you know your scores?
thankfully i knew them right at the spot _comma_  i got a   !
wow _comma_  that s fantastic . 
he doesn;t seem to see the issue . 
who doesn t?
my husband doesn t see flirting with girls a problem .  
what a jerk! that is definitely a problem!
i studied all week for my math finals and only scraped a    on it . 
that s a real bummer .  do you at least pass the class?
yeah  _comma_   passed with a     _comma_   not what i wanted but at least i passed
well at least you don t have to take it again .  could have been worse . 
i dropped my groceries in the parking lot
oh no _comma_  how awful for you! i hope people helped you to pick them up (and didn t help themselves!) . 
i grabbed the cans that rolled away _comma_  lol
glad you find humor in it! i dropped a bottle of water once _comma_  which rolled under the car .  i was livid!
one of my roommates left without cleaning his room and the school charged me and my roommates      each
that s extremely frustrating! what were they expecting you to do? it s not your fault your roommate left it trashed . 
yeah thats what we told them but they showed us the paper saying that its one of the rules .  we were so furious at that guy _comma_  worst thing is he never responded to our calls or texts .  really immature and selfish of him . 
well  _comma_   i guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you .  but that blows  _comma_   how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?
a restaurant that i wanted to eat at had  call ahead seating  where you can call and get placed on a waiting list .  i called ahead and was told we would have a table in    minutes .  when we arrived    minutes later _comma_  our table was not ready!
that is so annoying .  they should not call it that if they can t guarantee    minutes . 
that s what i told the hostess .  there was no point in calling ahead if we still have to wait    minutes for a table . 
hopefully the food was at least worth the wait .  i would have been annoyed as well . 
the food made it worth the wait _comma_  for sure! any other restaurant i would have walked out!
we had a new puppy .  he loved to chew on everything .  i went to the grocery store and when i got back home _comma_  the puppy had pulled the cushions off of the couch .  he had chewed through the bottom!!
oh god! i haven t had a puppy in a long time _comma_  but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy proof .  they find ways to make messes in the most creative ways . 
they do! i m really glad that that stage didn t last too long in him .  i just hated having to buy an entire new living room suite! puppies are expensive . 
yeah   _comma_    that s a real headache .  i d want to say they re worth it   _comma_    but on that day i wouldn t be so sure   _comma_    haha . 
i accidentally dropped my phone at the screen started to glitch out and didn t want to turn on anymore .  i was scared because it was a brand new phone .  thankfully after a while of it just sitting there it turned back on normally . 
that is a huge blessing _comma_  i don t know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone . 
same here _comma_  they re so incredibly important in this day and age . 
it s almost a shame how much we depend on them _comma_  but i know i d be lost without mine . 
i am bothered by my neighbors loud power tools next door
do they run them all day long   or at night?
during the morning and day on the weekends!
is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  i know in ours unless they are still running them at   pm _comma_  there is nothing the police will can do about it unfortunately   but i can imagine how annoying it is . 
my best friends invited me to a camping trip but i was a little anxious about the whole thing . 
i don t blame  you because i hate camping . 
really? i was just really scared of getting bitten by a tick .  i ended up enjoying the trip in the end!
oh i hate ticks and all the bugs . 
i was blown away by how great my friends were this weekend
what happened?
they were very supportive and kind  _comma_  helping me with some moving things
you are lucky to have such great friends!
a few weeks ago i was drinking with some friends at a park and i sliced my hand open while trying to rip a beer can in two . 
oh that sucks _comma_  i hope it has healed since then
it has! the cut was so deep and i was bleeding so much i was scared of passing out from blood loss . 
ouch _comma_  that sounds awful
moral of the story: don t rip open cans with your hands!
i was shocked how nice the weather was this morning
how come? have you had awful weather lately?
not really but it was just especially nice this morning
oh i see .  beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day!
i decided to move to be with my boyfriend . 
oh? big decision .  i hope you feel good about it!
i did _comma_  but i had to leave all my family behind
aw  _comma_   but they ll always be there for you when you visit .  you have to do what you want to in life  _comma_   after all
im mad at my neighbor today
oh that sucks! what did your neighbor do to get you angry?
he was using powertools loud in the morning
how inconsiderate .  people should have more common sense than your neighbor . 
last christmas _comma_  i saved up a lot of money and was able to buy my family and girlfriend really nice gifts . 
thats awesome _comma_  i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them
me too! the act of giving makes me feel so warm and happy . 
me too!
the teacher i had for calculus   last semester was so terrible at his job _comma_  i had to learn it all on my own . 
i hate when i get teachers that are clueless .  makes you wonder how they got the job . 
same here .  surprisingly _comma_  i was able to pass the course and i felt so good about myself!
well done .  you should feel proud for teaching yourself . 
i felt happy this morning because it was sunny and warm
that s always a great start to a day . 
absolutely _comma_  i was overjoyed
how are you celebrating it?
i have a big exam coming up tomorrow . 
oh wow .  what s the exam on?
it s on pc architecture .  i m feeling pretty good about it though .  i studied really hard all week . 
that s really great .  i am sure you will do well on the test . 
on my way back from a funeral _comma_  my friends and i almost got into a deadly car crash . 
oh no _comma_  what happened?
i think the other driver was falling asleep on the road .  out of nowhere _comma_  he moved onto the wrong lane directly towards us . 
well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that .  hopefully he didn t hurt anyone else . 
agreed .  i was so scared we could have been the ones in a casket that night . 
i was so happy that after many years in retail i found a better job . 
congratulations! retail really does suck . 
yeah it does .  it really made me dislike people a lot . 
understandably .  my girlfriend is a student and works in retail part time .  she says the same thing . 
do you ever hear an album and it brings you back to when you first listened to it?
oh _comma_  all the time .  what album is that for you?
i just listened to a billy talent album again the other day and it brought me back to high school and reminded me of the person who showed me them . 
i really love that album! we will have to listen to it together sometime . 
a while back _comma_  my older sister stole my younger brother s ipod touch to sell . 
that sucks .  did she make a lot of money off of it?
no idea .  all i know is that i was furious _comma_  especially seeing as my brother is the sweetest most innocent kid ever . 
i would ve been very angry too .  i hope the money went towards something useful . 
last night was quite a bummer . 
i am sorry to hear that .  why was it a bummer?
i was planning on going to a concert but ended up not going at the last minute because i didn t want to go by myself .  i feel like i m going to regret not going . 
that really stinks .  i bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret . 
after working for a week straight and running a lot of errands _comma_  today is my first day off in a while . 
that must feel very refreshing .  would you say you feel content?
it is  _comma_   i m super happy .  currently playing some zelda on the switch  _comma_   it couldn t get any better than this!
nice! i want to get that game next week .  looks really cool . 
i highly recommend it .  i can t put it down . 
my older brother always makes promises he can t keep . 
that is disappointing .  i wonder why he s like that . 
i don t know why .  recently we were supposed to go out for sushi lunch together _comma_  but he keeps postponing it .  i ll ask him for a definitive day . 
i hope he doesn t let you down . 
i m so happy for my brother!
something good happen to him recently?
he just graduated from college .  he put in so much work . 
that s amazing! tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger . 
my little brother failed his french class and had to spend three weeks in summer school . 
oh no _comma_  that s not good! he s not the only one that s not great at french .  most of my family spoke french as a second language when i was growing up and i still never picked it up!
french is a really hard language _comma_  i have trouble too so it really hurt my heart seeing him go to school while all his friends and siblings were having fun without him . 
hopefully he ll get to enjoy his next summer . 
my boyfriend s brothers got into a fist fight one night and he jumped in the middle . 
that sucks .  did anyone get hurt?
some things got broke and there were some bruises _comma_  but it was really scary to watch that . 
i bet .  i would ve hid under the table . 
i am blessed to have a great family
that s nice .  why do you say that?
they re just the best and always very helpful
that s great to hear .  i wish i had a helpful family . 
whenever my sister in law plans things _comma_  she only does it around her schedule . 
that s really selfish .  have you talked to her about it?
yeah  _comma_   but she says she tries her best and thinks she is doing what is best for everyone .  however  _comma_   we are the only ones with kids on a schedule . 
well _comma_  at least that s the case .  people can only do so much . 
this weekend was kind of a drag . 
oh yeah? why is that?
i couldn t find anyone that wanted to hangout so i had to spend the whole weekend by myself . 
well sometimes that isn t a bad thing really .  you didn t enjoy it at all?
i was feeling quite social  _comma_   though  _comma_   so it was kind of a buzzkill . 
the vacations i used to take when i was younger with my family have been on mind lately . 
are the good memories at least?
oh yeah _comma_  but it really makes me miss those times . 
at least you have those memories .  you should go on a vacation soon!
i m looking forward to this new game . 
which one?
the new spyro remastered .  it really makes feel think back to when i used to play the original with an old friend of mine .  
i ve actually haven t played that series .  when does it come out?
it comes out next month!
i told my sister in law that i would help her with her books .  after this last one _comma_  i felt bad because i told her i couldn t anymore . 
that s rough .  why can t you help her?
i just have too much going on now with two kids _comma_  and working from home . 
yeah _comma_  i am in the same boat .  it s a hard knock life out there . 
i saw some person eat like    hamburgers in mcdonalds
how long did it take them?
i think he was making a youtube video so he was eating very fast _comma_  so like    minutes
he must of been sick after . 
one time i bought emergency supplies before a hurricane
that was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time
yup _comma_  people started charging like    per bottle of water
wow _comma_  thats insane .   i feel like thats illegal
i just got some frustrating news the other day . 
what was the news?
my son got caught cheating on a test .  i really thought we raised him better than to do such things but here we are . 
are you going to ground him?
definitely at least going to have a long talk about why what he did was wrong .  there will be some kind of punishment that s for sure . 
my sister in law and her fiance are always taking trips abroad and we hardly ever go anywhere . 
why don t you join them?
we definitely don t have money for that _comma_  plus there are four of us . 
why don t you get another job?
ugh .  i got some awful news the other day . 
that s too bad .  what happened? is everyone ok?
i got news that my grandfather passed away .  he was old but no one saw it coming .  
oh i m so sorry to hear that .  i hoep your family is strong enough to support you through this . 
hi there was a time that i was scared out of my mind i came home and my front door was unlocked and the lights were on in the house
holy cow .   was anything missing?
no and that was the weird thing nothing was taken
had they gone through anything?
we recently celebrated my son s birthday _comma_  and had a big party . 
oh yeah that must have been a good time
it was! he got a lot of cool toys _comma_  and ate a bunch of ice cream . 
those are the best times when they still like to play with toy s mine lost interest years ago and i miss it
as he opened gifts  _comma_   he told people thank you  _comma_   and told them thanks for coming when they left .   i was pretty proud of our   year old . 
next month my wife and i will take our first vacation since we got married . 
that is awesome i will never forget the first time me and my wife went on vacation _comma_  where do you have planned to go?
we are going to hawaii for a whole week .  we have saved a long time to be able to afford this _comma_  i can barely wait till next month . 
that sounds like you guys will spend a lovely time over there good luck
do you feel when you see your mom after a long time
i miss her .  you haven t seen your mom in a long time?
why! what is the reason
i m sorry _comma_  but i can t understand what you re saying . 
are you were near to your mom
last year  _comma_   during the spring  _comma_   extremely heavy rainfall caused our basement to become flooded . 
oh man! i have been there _comma_  i hope you didn t have anything special down there??
i lost all of my childhood photos and many of my childhood toys and things i had saved _comma_  my bible from my late grandmother being one of the items . 
oh lord  _comma_   i am so sorry! i have been there  _comma_   that is hard!
last week _comma_  my coworkers all got together and threw me at party for my   th anniversary at work . 
taht sounds like fun _comma_  i wish i had coworkers that nice ahahah .  did you enjoy the party?
yes  _comma_   it was great .  i had no idea it was even happening  _comma_   they are so sneaky . 
ahahaah seems to be they really like you working threre
i took my dog to the vet yesterday .  it turns out that he s really sick . 
aww _comma_  i m sorry .   is he going to be ok?
it s not looking too good .  i really hope he pulls through . 
i do too .   that s one of the saddest things .   i hope you ll be ok too . 
i was working on a project in this past week  _comma_   couldn t find it locally  _comma_   so ended up ordering it online . 
wow nice
not really _comma_  it still hasn t shown up!  i m pretty annoyed!
ooops sorry to hear that
it s not that big of a deal _comma_  but i was really looking forward to finishing the project . 
i saw a deer get hit by a car yesterday . 
oh that sucks .  did someone move it out of the way?
it wasn t dead _comma_  it was injured and moved to the brush on the side of the road .  it was upsetting . 
yea you never like to see stuff like that . 
i opened up my mailbox this morning and there was a    dollar bill just sitting there inside!
did you try to find its owner?
i asked my neighbors about it _comma_  no one knew anything about it .  i guess it was left there intentionally . 
well that was nice of someone
a co worker i ve been working on a project with has been late
that s annoying _comma_  are you going to talk to them about it?
i plan on doing that _comma_  it s pretty disruptive
i hope it all works out in the end . 
i just finished a major project at work for a client
awesome! can you say what kind of project it is?
not at the moment _comma_  but i m praying my supervisor and client likes it
i hope so too! projects can be stressful!
i have an appointment for tomorrow .  i m hoping the same thing . 
what is the appointment for?
my cat hasn t been feeling well this past week _comma_  i think there might be something really wrong . 
let s hope not! my prayers are with her . 
i know .  i m so worried . 
thank you .  i hope it s something that he will get over soon . 
you re welcome .  it s always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that . 
i think there might be something wrong with the platform at the moment . 
my child needs to start going to bed early to prep for school .  last night _comma_  i caught her sneaking her phone and watching tv at   am . 
oh man  _comma_   sounds like most kids .  she s gonna hate it at first  _comma_   but getting to bed early will help with her future . 
i ve tried to explain that to her .  it s like it goes in one ear and out the other .  it bugs me . 
well yea _comma_  they re young right now and can t see the consequences yet . 
a group of coworkers who play the same lottery numbers every week won      _comma_     on the pick   last week . 
that is so lucky _comma_  they must be so happy they bought that ticket
they had asked me if i wanted to go in with them  _comma_   and i said no .  i regret that now  _comma_   i could have really used a share of that money . 
i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha
i studied really had so i am sure i will pass my test!
what kind of test is it
it was my science final for college .  
oh i hope you do well then
my friend went on a    day cruise to europe .  i wish that could have been me! 
wow i didnt even know they had cruises that go on for that long
right? talk about ultimate relaxation!
yea i wonder how much something like that costs  .  i guess if you have to ask you cant afford it as they say
my son is supposed to be sending me some money . 
that is really nice of him _comma_  how much time will you have to wait?
hopefully not too much longer .  i ve been waiting for a few days now . 
well i hope everything goes well at the bank and with the transaction
i am scared of another hurricane coming through florida .  i had a bad experience last year . 
that is horrible _comma_  natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them
no _comma_  all you can do is try to prepare .  do you live anywhere where there is threat of natural disasters? 
not really _comma_  the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunderstorm
when my son was born it felt like i had everything i needed in life . 
i bet that was a wonderful day
it really was _comma_  my life finally felt complete . 
i am very happy for you
i got passed over for a promotion at work last week _comma_  even thought i had more experience than the other applicants . 
that is not good _comma_  have you expressed your feelings to your boss?
i did _comma_  and it looks like i may be looking for a new job soon as they want to take the company in a new direction . 
well i hope everything goes well for you _comma_  you will sure find something fitting for you dont worry
i remember when i started my first office job out of college .  i was nervous because i didn t know what to expect . 
it s a whole new world when that happens _comma_  i can totally understand .  how d you cope with it?
i just tried to keep an open mind and go with the flow .  it was hard to get used to sitting at a desk for   hours a day _comma_  but i soon got used to it . 
it s always best to just open your mind to anything that could happen .  it s the best way to learn . 
i agree .  and if it doesn t work out _comma_  you can always move on to something different . 
i found some mold growing out in the garage
oh no _comma_  that s bad .    have you had someone come out and check the hose?
i ended up cleaning it myself _comma_  i think i got most of it out
may be worth letting your insruance comapny know .  usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won t cover any of it . 
i was thinking about when we finally got to go pick up rodimus after all that waiting!  i ve never been so excited in my life .   
what is that?
it s our rotty pup! sorry haha
oh that explains it!
yes!  we had been waiting forever to find just the right breeder and then we found him oh my gosh .   that felt like the longest week of my life!
i saw a child ask for a candy bar that the grocery store yesterday .  the mother spanked the child in front over every one in the line!
wow when the child just asked?!
yes! it was awful! luckily the man behind her spoke up .  i could tell she was embarrassed but i was furious at her!
i m only afraid that the mom is going to let out that embarassment on her child once they get home . 
i agree .  i hate seeing kids having to live in that type of situation .  some people shouldn t be parents
one time i saw someone s dog pooping in my lawn and they didn t pick it up!
omg that s so gross! 
yes _comma_  i wanted to throw it back at them!
that would be a memorable lesson to learn .  the best lessons are learned that hard way _comma_  after all .  
i used the bathroom at walmart the other day .  i walked around the store for about    minutes before i realized i had toilet paper stuck to my shoe!!!
oh god .  that s kinda gross . 
i felt gross hahaha i kicked it off of my shoe and stuffed it under a rack .  i hope know one saw . 
rest in peace whoever touches that rack . 
hahaha hope they wear gloves!
my son just started a new school .   the communication with them has been terrible!
oh dear .  how do they let the parents know what s going on?
i sometimes find out but it seems so disorganized!
that sounds really frustrating .  i m sorry that s happening!
we went to the lagoon a few weeks ago .  my friends dared me to jump off of the highest cliff into the water . 
oh wow .   terrifying .   all i think of is johnny erricson tada _comma_  who broke her neck in that situation .  did you do it?
that was what i was worried about! i ended up not jumping off of the highest one .  i was too scared .  i did jump off of the smallest one .  that was really fun!
you did the right thing!  oh fun!  i m glad you were safe and had a blast! 
i have a test coming up in one of my classes this week . 
do you feel ready for it?
oh yeah _comma_  i m definitely ready .  i know i m going to pass . 
awesome _comma_  hope it goes as planned!
i had about   or   hummingbirds in my yard the other day feeding . 
oh how exciting! did you take any pictures?
no .  my camera isn t good enough to get good pictures _comma_  they are so small . 
awww . that s a bit disappointing _comma_  but really cool that you got to see them!
i was trying to buy a piece of property that came up on the market _comma_  but someone put in a bid before i got a chance and it has already sold . 
the market can be competitive if the price is right .  they ll sell immediatley . 
it is a piece of property that my grandfather owned and i pretty much grew up on _comma_  i would have really liked to have owned it . 
that would have been awesome if you got it . 
i worked for weeks on a presentation for work .  i practiced over and over .  i felt relaxed the morning of . 
that s good! that probably means you worked on it until it became something you re proud of . 
you are right! i was really proud of it! i m glad i worked so hard on it .  it lessened the anxiety that i usually have!
maybe i could learn from that .  i get really nervous when i have to do any public speaking _comma_  so maybe if i just prepared for it better it would help . 
i was under the impression that my friends would pay me back . 
what did they do to you?
they owed me money but never paid me back .  i suppose it s not a huge deal though . 
it happens sometimes .  you may ask them directly to pay back . 
i worked with daughter for months with learning her multiplication tables .  we ve practiced and practiced and she still doesn t know them all!
i totally get that .   i m in the same place with my daughter .   i home school and she s learning them too .  give it time and she ll get it soon .   its so much to memorize at once! 
we homeschool too! i hope she can get them soon! it will make this year s math so much easier!
that s awesome!  she will!  the best thing about homeschooling is that they can learn more at their own pace .   i m not looking forward to division! ha ha
i m going on a hiking trip soon
do you hike very often?
here and there when i have time
i ve never been hiking _comma_  really! i d like to go some day . 
i scrapbook pictures of my son and i am a few years behind!
oh _comma_  such fun!  do you have all the stamp it up scrapbooking things i hear so much about? i bet it can be hard to keep it updated! they grow so fast!
my son just started school all day _comma_  so i plan to start scrapbooking .   i don t use stamp it up though . 
perfect!  now you ll be caught up in no time .   i know you ll be so gratified to finish and be able to look at all of them when he s much older . 
this past weekend  _comma_   my cat sam passed away  _comma_   he was    years old . 
so sorry to hear of sam s passing . 
yeah _comma_ it s been really strange the past few days without him asleep on my feet while i work . 
may your many memories of sam help you to sustain at this difficult time . 
i have nothing to complain about .  life is good . 
that is awesome .   i m with you on that .   tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great .   i don t like to take it for granted . 
no point in being a pessimist . 
exactly! you ll go far with that attitude!  
i baked a cake for my boyfriend s birthday and it turned out to be so delicious! he was so excited .  
mmm _comma_  now you re making me hungry for cake .  what kind of cake was it?
black forest cake! it happens to be both our favorite kind of cake .  i made it from scratch .  what s your favorite cake? 
personally i m a huge fan of red velvet _comma_  but black forest is amazing too!
i felt so bad when i had to board my dog while i was on vacation .  it made me feel like a bad dog mom! 
aww  _comma_   i know that can be hard  _comma_   but you can t be too hard on yourself .   sometimes you don t have a choice . 
i know .  she was so excited when we came home though which made us feel a bit better .  
absence makes the heart grow fonder . 
i m happy with the person that i grew up to be . 
what are some of your best traits?
i m healthy!
do you exercise often?
so we finally found the perfect rotty breeder and we got to pick up our puppy this week!
oh boy that is great news! i hope you didn t drop a pretty penny on it! haha  _comma_   and even if you did  _comma_   dogs are worth it . 
no he was the runt so we got him on the cheap side!  he is sooooo sweet!  i am so happy
hey runts are the best! they need love too .  either way _comma_  i m glad you were paired up with the perfect companion . 
thank you!  we are so excited!
i love going to disney world .  it makes me remember all the wonderful memories i made there as a child . 
i ve never been _comma_  but it looks like so much fun . 
it is a great place for both kids and adults! i don t have any kids yet _comma_  but can t wait to bring mine when i have them someday .  
it would be so much fun to go there as a family . 
sometimes when i am out in public _comma_  my son throws a tantrum . 
oh yeah i am right there with you _comma_  i just don t even go out anymore if i can help it! how old is yours? mines      
mine is   .   every now and then  _comma_   he says a curse word  _comma_   uses it properly too!
they are too smart for their own good
i was just about to make a sandwich to eat _comma_  when i discovered something really gross . 
what did you see? please don t tell me there was a bug in your bread
no _comma_  there weren t any bugs .  but there was mold . 
ewwww _comma_  so nasty! i almost ate a molded avocado today .  good thing i noticed before scooping it
the head of marketing at my job recently dumped a bunch of new tasks on me and my coworker .  i feel like she s just lazy and making us do her job . 
or maybe she just knows you re a great worker and very responsible? i hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks
ha _comma_  that s a really nice way of looking at it but nah i m pretty sure it s mostly laziness . 
did you try talking to her about it? just be straight forward and tell you how you feel
i thought about it but no  _comma_   it s not worth rocking the boat .  if she tries to pull that again and dump even more on us  _comma_   then i ll probably say something . 
i can t believe this!  some kid at the gas station nearly hit me and then had the nerve to call me awful names!
did you call the police?
no!  i got so flustered and kind of paniked .   
its horrible to have to got through things like thaty
guess what!  i nailed my review for this year and got a raise!
that s great! i m so happy for you!
thank you! i worked so hard and i am so freaking excited!  i am also up for a promotion if we keep growing!
ooh _comma_  will you be managing anyone?
i freaking dropped my coffee on the ground this morning
i hear you! i drop things all the time .  was it one you just bought?
yes .   and to make it even worse i soaked myself!
ugh! were you away from home?
right outside the office and with no spare clothes!
my stepdaughter graduated from college in may and got a job in san francisco making   times more than i have ever made . 
oh wow  _comma_   she s doing great .  i know it probably feels a bit bad that she s making so much more than you  _comma_   but hopefully you can find  away to be proud of her . 
i m definitely proud! it doesn t feel bad at all .  i m so happy about how much drive she has to succeed . 
oh well that s great! some people would get a little jealous .  i m glad you re proud of her _comma_  i m sure she worked very hard for her success!
i m maybe a little jealous _comma_  but i know how hard she works and how smart she has been with her decisions . 
whew .  i finally got all of my work done for the day . 
that is a good feeling!
it really is! now i can go home and just relax for the rest of the evening . 
nice! no kids at home?
nope _comma_  just me .  so it s nice and quiet . 
i am so nervous .   i have to go to the dentist tomorrow to get a filling replaced .  
are you afraid of the dentist?
i am!  i had a bad experience with one when i was younger . 
i m sorry to hear that  _comma_   i m pretty terrified of the dentist myself .  ask for gas! good luck  _comma_   i m sure everything will be just fine . 
i spoke at a conference recently .  i was a little scared going into it but felt great as i knew i knew my speech . 
oh nice! that s super brave of you . 
i m actually one of those fortunate people who doesn t have a fear of public speaking .  
that s a great skill to have!
i was cleaning out my attic and found a box full of old photo albums .  i spent the next few hours looking at old photos and having a great time . 
that must have been a nice feeling .  
it really was .  i miss a lot of the people in the photos _comma_  made me really smile to see their faces again . 
i love that nostalgic feeling .  
i am so irritated .   my dog keeps trying to eat up my shoes no matter where i put them!
haha  _comma_   sounds like my pupper  _comma_   is she still young?
yeah she s only about six months .   despite all her chew toys its still my shoes she craves . 
right!? it s weird  _comma_   you buy them all the toys in the world  _comma_   but they still go after your stuff . 
my husband works late at night and sometimes i m stuck by myself . 
why he is working late?
he owns his own business working on cars .  if something goes wrong _comma_  he is forced to stay to fix the issue . 
i understand .  could you plan to do something when he is late (going out with friends)?
that s a good idea! maybe i can have a boardgame night or something!
my aunt just signed for my cousin to get an fj cruiser! that is my dream car! he doesn t even have a job . 
aww man that sucks for you 
it does! maybe he will at least let me drive it!
hopefully! it is your dream car after all
i m looking forward to visiting a friend over the weekend
that should be fun .  any big planes?
nothing too big _comma_  probably just wander around town
that will be nice to catch up . 
i m so irritated at my neighbor .  she moved out recently and left all her garbage and old furniture in our parking lot by the garbage . 
that s not very considerate of her .  was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too? some people!
not at all   _comma_    that s what is so weird! she was really polite   _comma_    quiet   _comma_    and neat . 
i wonder what could have changed? either way _comma_  i d be pretty pissed off . 
i am! but whatever _comma_  nothing we can do but have the city come pick it up i guess . 
last week the plant i work at was hit with massive layoffs .  
oh no! that is terrible!
i was fortunate enough to be one of the very few who got to keep their job _comma_  i am happy but very sad for the others . 
i understand .  layoffs are hard .  my brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!
two years ago my wife and i got divorced .  it has been very odd in this big house all by myself . 
how do you feel these days?
it has gotten a little better with time _comma_  but still a pretty sore spot for me . 
it must be difficult _comma_  do you think she will come back ever?
i lost my job earlier this year .  i was really worried about how to pay my bills and finding a new job . 
ouch! that s rather painful .  what are you doing now?
well that s the cool thing .  the week my unemployment ran out i got a job offer .  at my former company _comma_  no less .  so everything worked out!
wow! that s like a paid vacation!
haha that s an awesome way to think about it!
last week a friend of mine won       on a scratch off ticket .  i buy those things all the time and never win squat . 
wow _comma_  that s incredible .  what s their secret? 
right place _comma_  right time i guess .  some people are just lucky . 
congrats to your friend .  i hope they share!
my niece got sent home from school yesterday with that stomach bug that s going around
that s unfortunate _comma_  hope you don t get it as well!
i know!  i ve been pretty worried about her .   she s such a tiny thing . 
i m sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time .  
my phone went missing .  imagine my surprise when i got a facebook message  from myself _comma_   it was the person who found it saying  i have your phone .  
wow .  that s kind of creepy actually .  were you able to get it back?
i was! the guy was really nice and refused the cash i tried to give him as a reward . 
you re very lucky he was nice and didn t steal any of your data . 
very! lucky for me it was a cheap phone _comma_  i think if i had the newest iphone or something i would have never seen it again . 
i just got some new neighbors .  i m kinda nosy so i asked if i could take a look at how they decorated _comma_  just out of curiosity . 
did you bring them a pan of ludefisk first? what did they say?
nah _comma_  although i did consider brownies .  they were happy to meet me so it was all good .  but man i couldn t believe how nice their place looked compared to mine! i am a little jealous of their interior decorating skills . 
next time they let you in _comma_  just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies . 
my kid was signing the spice girls a few years ago .  she thought she had discovered a new band! she asked if i had ever heard of them before . 
yeah _comma_  they are cute like that .  how old is she ?
she almost    now .  she loves to listen to all of the bands from when i was younger .  it s really cute . 
i have a    year old like that . 
my daughter practiced her gymnastics every day all summer .  we just found out that she made the team!
that s amazing .  watching your children succeed is so rewarding
it is! i cannot wait to see what s in store for her future! maybe a scholarship!
that is awesome .  i hope she has very much success in her gymnastic endevours . 
thank you!
you are very welcome .  good luck!
my grandma threw away my high school yearbooks . 
that s awful! i hope that she didn t mean too!
i don t think she realized what they were .  i was pretty irritated as they can t be replaced but what can you do?
yeah _comma_  it really sounds like she didn t mean to .  sometimes you can find copies online if you look .  
good suggestion! really i wanted to keep all the signatures and notes from my friends but oh well .  i will see them next month for our reunion anyway!
we ve had our dog for over   years .  he past away this spring . 
i m so so sorry!  we lost our chihuahua in february _comma_  so i completely understand that feeling .   was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden?
it was sudden .  he was completely fine when we went to bed .  no issues at all .  its been hard for our daughter
i think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves .   our pup was our daughter s dog and she was sick prior to passing  _comma_   so we knew it was coming .   still doesn t really help though .   we ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom   it was meant to me   my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom .   it s helped  _comma_   something to think about at least . 
i completely agree .  i broke down just watching her cry at the spot where we buried him .  i m not sure if i want to get another dog yet .  we have chickens so she s began to show them more attention now . 
i bought my daughter her first cell phone .  it s a lot of responsibility for her .  i hope she is ready for it . 
i am sure she will be smart with it
i hope so .  she has done well with tablets so i m hoping she ll do the same with a phone
you can always show her the ways
this is true! i also put an app on her phone to block things she s not old enough to use
i accidentally knocked over a little kid coming out of the store the other day . 
were they okay?
yeah thankfully he was totally fine .  but i felt so bad . 
at least you re not getting sued
oh man _comma_  that would be terrible .  way to look on the bright side!
im good at that lol
i m going skydiving this weekend .  my stomach all ready hurts with fear . 
don t worry you ll be fine .   it s safe . 
this is my  rd time and i m still scared
i m surprised you haven t started to relax a little yet . 
have you ever went .  when you looking down from    _comma_     feet you get scared . 
we moved into a     year old house .  there are creeks and cracks that creep me out!
i can only imagine .  at least its nice in the day time though?
sometimes .  i try to avoid that attic during any time of the day! there s also a weird door about knee height .  when you open it up _comma_  it s just big enough to fit a storage tub . 
i am not sure i would do well in that house
it is really creepy! 
after my mom passed away i found all our old cassette tapes in her storage _comma_  listening to those was pretty cool . 
bet that brought back good memories . 
definitely _comma_  brought me right back to the road trips we took when i was younger . 
where did you guys usually go?
everywhere! sometimes we just hopped in the car and went like two or three hours from home just to do something for the day . 
i ve spent all day getting my kit ready for the next competition this weekend .  i m exhausted . 
whats the competition on ?
highland games .  i throw the caber and heavy hammer . 
nice hope you win  _comma_  ill be looking into this further 
i m so angry at my self .  i was in my performance review today and i passed wind in front of my boss .  omg 
i wonder how that was noted on your report . 
i got a raise so not that bad but it was still off putting .  i ve heard her rip one in the past so i guess no judgement .  
sounds like a wacky place to work . 
i got a raise today .  i ve pushed my self hard this last year and i deserve it . 
that is awesome .  congratulations .  im sure you earned every penny . 
thanks it s been a rough year .  my hours were cut but i was expected to keep up the same work load .  thanks again!
good things happen to people who put in the effort .  it sounds well deserved . 
for the last few nights i ve heard weird sounds outside my bedroom window . 
oh no! do you think it s a wild animal?
i don t think so _comma_  it doesn t sound like any animal i recognize .  it s really creepy . 
i hope it s not a crazy person or worse _comma_  an alien waiting to abduct you!
i told my daughter she wasn t allowed to watch youtube because it s hard to monitor .  i caught her sneaking and watching videos last night!
its so hard to monitor that stuff now
it is! there s also a ton of weird stuff on there that s labeled for kids . 
yeah _comma_  that is a scary thing to think about too
i walk my dog for    minutes at a time but no matter what _comma_  he always ends up using the bathroom inside! i wish he would left me know if he needs to go out . 
on no!  that is no good!  is he still a puppy?
no! he s about   years old now .  sometimes i think he does it out a spite when he s not getting enough attention!
hopefully he is not doing it out of spite!  maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior . 
that s not a bad idea!
my neighbor stole a package from me . 
no way? do you have proof? that is terrible . 
so check this out  _comma_   i ordered a planter for my porch .  that s how i know he did it  _comma_   the exact planter i ordered and never got appeared on his porch a few days after my package went missing!
wow .  that is horrible .  i would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police .  i would be so angry . 
yeah _comma_  i m pretty livid .  i think i will report him to our hoa and see what they say . 
i moved to northern alaska last year and don t know anyone .  
you havent met all three people in the city yet?
haha .  i live about   hour south of barrow the most northern place in the usa and about    hours north of any actual city .  
ah well it sounds like i hit the nail on the head
it s the most beautiful place you can move just no one here .  me and the animals .  
my coworker was able to find a new job after only looking for like a week . 
what kind of job was it
sales _comma_  so i m not really envious about that part as i m not into sales but i was still upset that he found a job so easily and i couldn t .  we both wanted out of that company so bad . 
sales do sound hard to do
my cat got sick the other day _comma_  he was really pathetic .  i felt so bad for him . 
is he going to be okay
yes _comma_  thankfully! the vet gave him some fluids and i made sure he got some food in him .  he s doing much better today . 
i am glad then _comma_  i hate to see pets in pain
my friend is a single mom who works full time .  she just graduated college!
that is quite an accomplishment .   someone like that is really inspiring . 
right? i m so proud of her .  her accomplishment really made me think about just how lazy i am in my own life haha
hahahaha  _comma_   it s hard to compare yourself with that  _comma_   but it really let s you know what s possible if you really want something . 
i think i got my coworker in trouble . 
why? were they not working?
he called in sick   _comma_    but spent the day at the waterpark with his kids .  i didn t realize he d called in sick   _comma_    i thought he was just out .  so   _comma_    i accidentally told my boss where he was . 
he should have been honest from the start .  it s on him not you . 
thanks _comma_  that s a good point .  or at least let me know he s going to lie so i can cover for him!
do you think your boss will tell him it s you that told on him?
saturday i m climbing mt .  elbert the highest mountain in the lower    .  the nerves has started to set in . 
that s so cool! do you do a lot of climbing?
not so much any more that i moved to the east coast .  i do more surfing now but i was able to get off work so i fly into colorado thursday . 
wow _comma_  so a proper adventure then .  have fun and stay safe!
drove past the area my middle school was in today .  it was gone .  i hated it when i was in school but now that s it gone i m sad
yea funny how that happens
it was not even that long ago i went to that school .  it s been less then    years .  they did not even build anything .  it s a park now . 
well at least its being put to good use
i m going to job interview thursday .  i m currently employed but i m ready to move on . 
hey congrats!  is it in the same field?
yes _comma_  i m currently in middle management this would be the next step up .  i m excited and nervous 
heyyy! that s awesome!  i wish you luck! will it come with a sweet raise too?
my cousin passed the cpa exam!
congratulation .  what is he planning to do next?
she s already working at a big   firm so she s just going to stick with that for a few years .  i m proud of her _comma_  it wasn t easy!
good .  i hope it will help her in career growth . 
i just got a new manager at work .  she is really young but seems to be full of good ideals . 
that s cool!  maybe you ll get along great!
i plan to steer clear .  i m going to relocate in january so i just need to lay low .  i hope she does a great job . 
lol why do you have to steer clear?
i m not looking to make a good or bad impression .  i just want to do my job and go home .  
ahhh .   i got you!  well good luck on the relocation!
the other weekend i really wanted to go out _comma_  but i realized i don t have any good friends left . 
that is a bad realization to come to .   where did they all go?
well i used to hang out with a lot of my coworkers but i left that job .  and just kind of drifted away from everyone else .  i definitely need to find a new sport or something and make new friends . 
yeah  _comma_   that is tough .   once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people .   maybe you could join a softball league  _comma_   that s what i did . 
the other day i was short on cash i needed to pay my phone bill .  
it can be hard these days _comma_  money is tight
so true .  i lucked out though and found a     bill on the ground! i hope the person who lost it didn t need it really bad because it definitely helped me out . 
i bet that was a nice surprise
i lost my credit card this weekend and then in the worst place walmart . 
did you get it all straightened out?
yes i was very stun someone did a good deed and turned it in with my wallet and all the money in it i was very grateful .  
wow that is awesome  _comma_   too rare in these times  _comma_   count your lucky stars!
my oldest daughter started elementary school today i was so glad she had a great first day . 
oh wonderful!  i m glad it went so well!  did she already know some friends there or was it a new school for her?
a new school that s why i was kind of nervous and scared but she loved it . 
oh boy _comma_  i bet you were nervous .   i would ve been too!  sounds like she s got a great and fun year ahead of her!
my neighbor keeps letting her dog use the bathroom on her balcony . 
that is just gross!  have you spoken to her about it?
it s revolting .  i reported her to the hoa but she keeps doing it .  i m going to say something if i catch her out there letting her dog out . 
i hope the hoa does something about that   that s just disgusting!
the other day i made fish tacos and did nothing else all day but relax on the couch . 
bet that was a nice calming down . 
very .  it was nice and chill and low pressure _comma_  just how i like it . 
did you get up to anything else fun?
not doing anything was my idea of fun!
i did a walk a thon last week for back to school drive and needy kids it was s long walk but i finished it i felt so happy .  
that sounds awesome _comma_  i bet you feel proud! its nice to do things for kids who are in need . 
i did before the walk i was un assured i would finish but i did so i was overly proud and it was a great cause that raised lots of money .  
of course! dont let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything!
went out to eat with my boyfriend the other day .  saw our waiter pick his nose and wipe it on his shirt . 
oh gross _comma_  i would lose my appetite
it really was gross .  i was so grossed out i asked to get moved to the bar so we could get a different server . 
yeah _comma_  i would probably just leave the restaurant altogether
i am so scared of snakes there was one in my back yard a few weeks ago . 
oh my goodness _comma_  that is no fun .   was it poisonous?
when i looked it up on line it was one of the garden snakes but i m still frightened by them all lol even the harmless ones .  
they can still bite _comma_  so it s better safe than sorry .   my father in law just got bitten by a black snake recently not poisonous but still painful . 
i will stay clear of them all not taking any chances .  
i m a neat freak and my house has to stay clean and in place always such a pet peeve of mines .  
do you have ocd?
very bad and when my family has the house out of place i become so furious i just like things clean and in order . 
i just love when the house is clean _comma_  makes you feel good . 
yes and so relaxed and peaceful .  
my supervisor totally stole all the credit for a client i brought in . 
that s a bad supervisor .  did you call him her out on it?
i totally did .  and let the ceo know about his behavior . 
i hope he got in trouble!
unfortunately no _comma_  the ceo thinks he can do no wrong .  eventually he ll figure out what a jerk he is . 
i start back college next week i can t wait to finish getting my degree for me and my family .  
oh most are dreading going back to school .  what s your major?
i m going for nursing and i have dreaded going back for   years now but my support system pushed me to follow my dream i m thankful to have them . 
nursing can be difficult  _comma_   but if you have determination and a good support system  _comma_   i m sure you ll do great!
it is but i know the hard work will pay off in the end . 
i recently applied for a promotion at work . 
how d it go?
i didn t get it . 
i m so sorry to hear that .  i hope another opportunity comes up . 
me _comma_  too .   then i found out someone else less qualified got it . 
i m shopping for a new bicycle! can t wait to pick one out . 
that sounds like fun!  are you big into biking?
i have been recently _comma_  yes .  i m using an old beat up hand me down mountain bike so getting the right bike for me is going to be so much fun . 
mountain biking is great .   is is really theraputic .   i hope you enjoy your new bike
the crime rate in my city is so high right now it breaks my heart and things need to change . 
that s horrible .  what can people do to change things?
first thing get the young crowd out the streets and take the weapons away a   year old passed this weekend because of this it is so heart breaking . 
yes! the weapons thing is so important .  
found out recently that one of my best friends from back home died in an accident . 
oh my gosh! that is horrible! i am so sorry to hear that . 
thank you .  i don t even have it in me to call her parents and offer my condolences yet _comma_  it s just too shocking . 
i understand that .  just give it some time and call when you are ready . 
i started my new job last week and already i feel part of the team .  
that s great .  getting good coworkers is so hit or miss sometimes . 
it is and that s why i was nervous but the staff was so kind and open .  
that sounds like a wonderful place .  i m kinda jealous hahaha . 
lol don t be let s just hope i can still say this in   months .  
one time someone kicked my dog!
that s awful! what did you do?
nothing! my dog was just walking passed him!
no .  i mean did you yell at the person or anything after they did it?
i got laid off from a job that i really used to love . 
woah that s really bad!! is it due to cost cutting? they let you off . 
sort of _comma_  the company was being run into the ground by poor management .  it hurt at first but then i realized just how much i d started to hate the work and the company . 
it happens!! i hope you will find a better job with a better company!!
i can t believe i lost my phone today while running errands . 
oh no _comma_  that s the worst . 
sad part is i have no idea which store that s why i am so upset . 
i hope you can get it back somehow!
i ended up on one of those  top    under     lists for people in my profession .  felt pretty good . 
that is an amazing accomplishment .   what field are you in?
finance   _comma_    basically   _comma_    but it was a little broader than that .  i wish my mom were still around   _comma_    she would have been so happy . 
i m sure you know that she is so proud of you!  that is really incredible!  congratulations!
thank you!
i was shocked my husband bought me flowers today out of the blue . 
that is so romantic .   they weren t for any occasion?
nope not at all _comma_  that s why i was so shocked! 
were they your favorites?
i was so grossed out about the molded bread i bought today . 
oh yuck .  did you get a chance to return it to the store?
i tried to _comma_  but they had a no refund policy .  
that s crazy! i d leave it on the counter at the store .  hopefully you aren t out much money . 
seeing my kids face when i finally brought a puppy home was priceless! 
wow that must have been amazing!
it really was _comma_  and i got it on video too . 
they re going to remember that forever
while my car was parked on the street in front of my house last week _comma_  someone ran into it and left a huge dent . 
dang _comma_  that sucks .  did you ever catch the culprit?
no  _comma_   they didn t leave a insurance card or anything  _comma_   just drove off .  some people are so worthless . 
yeah _comma_  that guy sounds like a jerk .  did your insurance cover the dent?
last month my dog skippy passed away .  he was    years old . 
oh wow! my dog jr died of old age too . 
man it s hard .  he has been like my best friend since i was a teenager . 
oh _comma_  did something happen to him?
my dog died of old age today . 
i am sorry to hear that .  mine died of old age as well last month . 
i am sorry that happened too .  i never thought i would be this upset over a dog . 
me neither   _comma_    but in the end   _comma_    i really didn t think about him as a dog   _comma_    he was just my buddy .  i hope fond memories of him get you through this . 
i waited the longest three weeks of my life to get something i ordered online . 
that can be so aggravating .  did the company make it up to you for being so late?
it got worse .  when it finally arrived  _comma_   the box was all busted up and my item was broken .  so yeah  _comma_   safe to say they had a lot to make up for . 
at least they made up for it .  if they had not i wouldn t use them again . 
my husband has been getting on my nerves worrying about his football team losing . 
i know the feeling .  what team is he rooting for? 
he is crazy about the falcons . 
i don t even know what team that is _comma_  haha .  football is lost on me .  
i am also sure i fixed my computer today . 
oh that s good _comma_  last time my computer broke was a day before i left the country
that would be a nightmare! all i had to do was replace the fan . 
i took it to the apple store and it actually got fixed in   mins _comma_  just needed a hardware reset
my husband was just sent to iraq and i already miss him so much . 
oh my goodness _comma_  is he with the armed forces?
yes the army _comma_  he will be there for   years . 
i cannot imagine how hard that is on the family and the soldier .   while i can t bring him home quicker  _comma_   i do want to say thank you to you  _comma_    him and your family for your sacrifice . 
i am in shock ever since my house caught on fire while i was at work . 
that is horrible _comma_  did anyone get hurt?
no  _comma_   thank goodness no one was home  _comma_   but their is nothing left of our house . 
hopefully you had insurance and somewhere to stay . 
one time i heard a large knock on my door while i was sleeping
that is scary .   what was it?
it was a couple of drug addicts trying to come in!
gosh it s worse than i thought it would be .   what did you do?
i have very low mark
sorry to hear that .  what happened on the test?
exam mark is low in school
hopefully next time you will get a better score and study more!
ok thank you
am so happy for my brother _comma_  he graduated with honors
he must be very smart
yah _comma_  he had done his best
it paid off .  wish i was smart like that
i am alone in the house my parents travelled _comma_  i feel lonely and afraid
oh no .  how old are you?
am    years of age
is there anyone you could go and visit and maybe stay the night?
i feel lonely my friend did not make to join me i watching a movie
i m sorry to hear that . 
yah _comma_  i decided to sleep
i hope things are better next time . 
today is my anniversary! my husband planned an amazing day! he bought me my favorite chocolates and is taking me to a concert tonight! i had no idea about the concert!
that s great to hear that some really care and put effort in to their relationships!
he usually doesn t do this much! i guess after years of hinting _comma_  he s finally picking up on them! haha
lol! oh geez  so many take years to get it ugh! but at least he finally has! i hope he is very romantic too!
haha yeah it does! we ve been together almost    years . 
congrats   
i had my front door open and a cat (not mine) ran in my house . 
not yours? that is so weird _comma_  usually they  are on their way out not in! lol
i know! we were all surprised .  my god was going nuts and my cat hid under the couch while we chased the stray around trying to get it out . 
did you eventually get it out? i would have been flipping bonkers! 
this has been the worst year ever for tornadoes in our area .  this past spring we spent   hours in our basement due to all the tornadoes in our area . 
that sounds terrifying! im glad you have a basement though _comma_  it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in!
yes    _comma_     a lot of people don t have basements    _comma_     and that would be really bad .  it s hard to explain to a three year old why you are in such a dark    _comma_     scary place    _comma_     especially when the power is all out . 
oh your right _comma_  i have an almost   year old and i wouldn t know how to explain it as well! that is so hard sometimes because you don t know what to say!
i was in the grocery store .  i found what i needed on the top shelf .  i climbed onto the bottom shelf but ended up knocking everything down!
oh my goodness _comma_  are you alright? i bet you created a mess!
yeah! the only thing that was hurt was my pride! i ve never tried to check out so quickly!
i hope you can laugh a little about it now!
my favorite band is doing their last tour .  my husband bought me tickets to see their concert! he surprised me with them today!
that sounds like a great gift .  that is going to be a great time . 
it is! i m really excited for it! it s tonight _comma_  so it was also a big surprise! 
wow .  i am sure you will remember this for a long time .  you are going to have to think of a great surprise for him now . 
i know! i wasn t really planning to do much this year hahaha
last month _comma_  my dog duke passed away .  i got him when he was just a puppy    years ago . 
i m sorry to hear about that .  it sounds like   _comma_    to me   _comma_    that he lived a long life with you though   _comma_    and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him .  i m worried for my girlfriend and what she ll do when that happens to her and her dog
yeah _comma_  we did everything together .  i still have to stop myself from calling him when i go to bed at night .  it s amazing how close we can get to our pets . 
that s crazy _comma_  and a little heart breaking too .  i m envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had .  i have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet .  i hope i do at some point
i was driving around my old neighborhood and seen that the house i grew up in had burned down . 
that s so sad . did you have a lot of good memories in that house?
i spent birth till i was    living there _comma_  so literally all of my child hood memories .  
i m so sorry :( at least you have your memories to look back on . 
my wife got a flat tire on her way home from work and a man was kind enough to stop and help her change the tire . 
that was really nice of him .  i know that she had to be relieved . 
as was i .  i was about    miles away at the time and she was on the side of the highway . 
someone was watching over her . 
just over   years ago _comma_  my wife and i got divorced .  it was so strange being in our big house all alone without her and the kids . 
how long had you been married ?
just short of   years .  she met someone online in wow of all places and just up and moved in with him . 
hmm .  that s a bit of a strange story . 
back when i was in college _comma_  i crossed a street in wrong place and got a ticket . 
i hate to hear that .  i hate tickets .  there are so many other things i would rather spend my money on . 
exactly _comma_  especially when you get one for just walking . 
yeah _comma_  that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for . 
my wife and i are going to buy are very first brand new car this week . 
cool _comma_  what are you getting?
a chevy cruze .  we have been working hard to get our credit score up to get a really good interest rate . 
that s a nice car _comma_  you are going to enjoy it . 
i took my three children camping recently _comma_  and we had a great time . 
neat! we took our daughter and her cousin camping about   weeks ago! did ya ll build a fire?
of course!  i have found that the key to a great camping experience is to have a checklist of what to bring _comma_  and follow it . 
that s defiantly a priority! i hope you brought everything that you need .  forgetting something can be a pain
my daughter finally master the     times .  we worked very hard on it this summer!
the     times as in multiplication?  teaching children is so rewarding . 
yes in multiplication! i m glad she s finally grasped them .  now we just need to work on      hahaha
i bet she was super excited to get it all down . 
she was!
my daughter starts public school for the first time in   years! i think she is going to do great but she s a little bit nervous . 
what grade is she in?
she is in  th grade . 
what kind of school was she at before?
we have been homeschooling .  i m having to go back to work now _comma_  so she s not too happy about it .  i think she will be just fine that .  she s well socialized 
me and my family just came back from vacation we had a great time . 
where did you go ?
we went to disney world in orlando _comma_ fl to see my kids have a great time made me happy can t wait for our next vacation . 
we went there a few years back .  had a great time . 
well _comma_  i finally got a call back from that job i interviewed for the other day . 
awesome news!  what was the response?
well _comma_  they decided not to hire me .  this stinks . 
oh .   not so good news then :(  i m sorry .   i m sure you ll find something!
my wife held a surprise birthday party for me .  it was totally unexpected and i was shocked when i came home and so many people were there . 
that s awesome _comma_  i bet you were overjoyed with it!
i couldn t believe that no one let the cat out of the bag .  it must have been hard to plan . 
you never know if someone is going to slip and spoil it for you _comma_  that s true!
last week during the night someone came into my yard and stole my push mower . 
oh no!  do you have any way of finding out who did it?
no  _comma_   i called the police but it s almost impossible to track .  i had to chained to a steel post  _comma_   but they cut the chain with bolt cutters i guess .  i sure hate thieves . 
yeah  _comma_   thieves are terrible .   i mean  _comma_   who would steal a mower?
my food had hair in it at a restaurant worst experience ever . 
what did you do?
i called the manager over and they offered to redo the food and pay for it but i was so sicken and upset i said no thank you it ruined my whole appetite .  
yea i can see that _comma_  it happens but it sucks
i m not one to like scary movies that much only with my husband since he loves them so much . 
well atleast you watch them with him! i dont like them either .  
we watched the new movie it i was a little frightened and creep out especially because i m afraid of clowns lol . 
oh no _comma_  no thank you! lol ahhh i cant even .  
my wife is going away on a business trip soon .  she ll be gone for a couple of weeks . 
that ll be tough .   do you have anything you can do to keep busy?
well _comma_  i might do some work on the house .  but it s going to be awfully quiet around here . 
i bet .   it s sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house . 
ugh _comma_  my neighbor keeps playing his music really loud at night when i m trying to sleep . 
spray water over there
ha _comma_  that s not a bad idea .  i do need to have a word with him about it though at least . 
thats good _comma_  you should
someone at work keeps stealing my lunch from the fridge! so infuriating!
could you get with your hr department to see if they can assist?
i might give that a try .  but whoever did it had probably better hope that i don t find out who they are!
what would you do to them?
well nothing too serious _comma_  but i d definitely have a word or two with them!
i don t like the dark . 
yea _comma_  i used to hate it too . 
i get so worried about something happening to me . 
like a paranormal type fear or a human with intent to harm type fear?
more of a human with intent to harm type fear . 
i ve been stuck for several weeks on a part in this video game i ve been playing . 
is it really hard? or you just have not have that much time to paly
it s pretty tough .  but it doesn t matter now .  i let a friend of mine have a try _comma_  and he got through it right away! it was pretty impressive to see . 
yeah some people are just naturaly good at video games
so the fiance managed to rewire one of the wall outlets yesterday!
that s pretty impressive _comma_  does he have any training or just all self taught?
a little bit of both!  i didn t know he had these skills but it was really neat to watch!
well it s certainly nice to have someone around with handy knowledge like that!
ugh _comma_  my neighbor s dog just keeps barking all day long .  it s driving me insane . 
that is frustrating!  we have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs .   so annoying all day!
it really is .  and i ve talked to him a few times about it _comma_  but he doesn t seem to care at all . 
i am sure he thinks it s his world _comma_  the rules dont apply to him .   sorry you have to deal with that people can be so rude
my brother is getting out of jail next week . 
well you must be happy about it . 
not really .  i m the one that turned him in .  and i m scared that he might know about that . 
oh! that is bad then .   be careful . 
i have a dr appointment tomorrow to make sure my cancer is still in remission . 
i hope you hear good news . 
i think i will .  it s been   years since my last treatment .  i still get nervous when i have my checkups though . 
i understand .  i guess you ll always feel that way . 
my brother is supposed to be paying me back for the food i bought for him last week . 
it was nice of you to buy him food _comma_  but i m thinking he didn t pay you back . 
nope  _comma_   i ve been waiting for a few days  _comma_   and i could really use that money now . 
i m sorry .  i know it sucks to need money and be counting on it _comma_  and then you don t get it .  i hope he pays you back soon . 
i stepped out of my front door this morning .  and right into an unpleasant surprise that my neighbor s dog left for me . 
ugh! i use to have the same problem with my neighbors dog who would poop in my driveway! at least it was my tires and not my feet that got the unpleasant surprise . 
yeah .  the smell was so bad .  it took forever to get that off of my shoe . 
does this happen often? i d let my neighbor know about it . 
i got a phone call from a friend that i haven t heard from in a really long time . 
that s great! you must have been so surprised and pleased to hear from them . 
i was! it was so great hearing from her again . 
i bet you had tons of catching up to do!
i have a meeting with my boss in a few hours . 
the way you wrote that makes it seem like you re anticipating something bad .  do you mind if i ask what you re expecting to happen?
see _comma_  that s the thing .  i have no idea what to expect .  that s why i m so nervous about it . 
interesting .  well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead .  if you re not sure what it could be _comma_  then at least it s not some obvious mistake or negligence on your part .  i hope for the best for you
my mother is getting very old .  and she really isn t in great health these days . 
that is unfortunate  _comma_   my own mother was ill for several years  _comma_   she is getting older as well .  do you get to see her often?
yeah _comma_  i try to go see her at least twice a week .  i m not sure how much longer she ll be with us . 
just spend what time you can with her _comma_  i d like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks .  sorry you are having to deal with it . 
when i was out of work my car broke down and since it was my only car a friend of mine actually gave me his old car to replace it .  it was such a nice gesture . 
that was great of him!
it was .  i insisted that i pay him after i got a job but he wouldn t take the money . 
he sounds very nice!
i finished a major work assignment in a short amount of time
oh really what was the assignment
it was a presentation that had to be quickly put together .   my supervisor seemed pleased
it s always great to get back positive feedback!
i remember when the ps  was first launching .   it was the first game console i ever ordered onilne and i was really looking forward to having it delivered . 
what was it like when it showed up on your door?
i was watching the front door like a hawk _comma_  and constantly checking for online tracking updates .   i kept worrying that someone would steal it of my porch if i didn t get it right away . 
thats hilarious _comma_  you finally got it though uhuh?
oh yeah .   as soon as i heard the knock i flung the door open and snatched it in a hurry . 
a friend was supposed to meet me for lunch _comma_  but didn t show
im sure they had a good excuse . 
he said he was busy with work _comma_  so i suppose so
oh i see .  hopefully its just that one time where he couldnt get to his phone to let you know . 
i accidentally left my phone at a restaurant
oh crap! how long untill you realized?
a few minutes after leaving _comma_  i was able to get it back
thats so good _comma_  man i have done that a time of two . 
i m sure i will pass my law exam . 
i am sure you will as well .  confidence is great!
thank you .  i m almost done with school!
congratulations .  you have done great!
a friend got a new car
that s really cool .  what kind of car?
bmw _comma_  it was a model i had been looking to get myself 
that  sounds like a really awesome car!
i carry around the ticket stub from the first concert i attended in my wallet .   it brings back good memories i had spending time with my friends . 
aww _comma_  that s really sweet and sentimental .  i like that .  can you still read the words on it?
the edges are a little frayed but i can still make out everything on it .   i keep it in a zippered compartment to preserve it .   maybe i ll frame it someday . 
i was going to say  _comma_   yeah  _comma_   that s the kind of thing i would love to preserve in a frame or something for my office .  how cool!
yeah _comma_  it s a nice little souvenir to remind me of good times .   it was a great concert and experience for all of us . 
who did you go see? and are you still friends with all the same people? i wonder if any of them kept their ticket stubs too . 
we went to see incubus  _comma_   it was our favorite band going through high school .   i went with my best friends who i m still best friends with  _comma_   and they actually did keep theirs too .  
hey _comma_  the other day i didn t have a pen while trying to fill out some paperwork
that stinks .  what did you do?
yeah! well i was in a parking garage so i went walking to try and find someone to borrow a pen from
and did you find one?
i did _comma_  this really nice woman just gave me a very fancy one .  she told me to keep it!
oh that is awesome .  and you got a fancy pen out of it
hi! i had ear surgery a few months ago
did it went well?
yeah it went really well actually _comma_  the result was better than i had hoped for in fact!
that is great .  what was the issue with your ear?
thanks! i had a bone that had fused inside my ear and made me deaf _comma_  and they replaced it with a titanium piston!
i moved over the weekend .   although it took about   hours to load the truck _comma_  when we unloaded the next day it took a little under an hour . 
you made quick work out of that
yeah _comma_  i was really happy that the unloading took as little time as it did . 
i wish i could unload that fast
i was scared of the spider in my bathroom . 
oh goodness .  that has happened to me before .  i could not sleep
it was a brown recluse .  i had no clue that i had poisonous spiders at my house . 
how in the world did it get in your house? were you able to kill it?
my girlfriend moved in this past weekend .   i am really excited to start this next chapter in my life . 
oooooooooo nice!
yeah _comma_  i m excited .   first girlfriend that i ve lived with but she is pretty awesome so i m glad it finally happened . 
well you two have fun tonight .   i won t tell your parents about all this . 
i got a new job and it is so great and i have my old supervisor to thank she s the best . 
why you need to thank her? is she the one that helped you to find the new job?
she was a great influence and gave me words of encouragement to branch out and go for more then our company job . 
she is very nice person .  that is great . 
i am nervous about my son starting school this year . 
oh .  will he be starting elementary school?
yes _comma_  he will be starting kindergarten this year . 
aw he s at that precious age where you have to let his hand go _comma_  hu?

i wish you and your fam peace happiness love and good health . 
i am so mad my neighbor killed my dog because she was mad at me .

i sure do i have it on video and made a report with the police already . 
good hope that bitch goes to hell . sorry i love animals and my mom s dog died the same way
i am so annoyed my neighbor s trash always ends up in my yard . 
that is a big deal .   what are you going to do?
i have tried everything _comma_  but they keep doing it even after paying huge fines . 
i would throw trash in their yard . 
my husband has been on his second tour in iraq .  seems like i wont see him in forever .  
he sounds like a real hero though .  i hope he comes home safe soon
thank you _comma_  the kids and i miss him terribly .  
i can only imagine .  at least you have each other 
i lost everything in the fire today . 
are you and your family okay?
we are thank heavens _comma_  but we lost everything .  
i am sorry _comma_  you can replace it though
i once left all cash and didn t have any to pay for a metro ride _comma_  some random girl paid for me without saying a word . 
wow!  how kind is that!  their really are kind people left in this world .   how did you respond?
yes _comma_  and i am thankful for those kind of people . 
 there  oops .   did you ever find out her name?  or find out a way to thank her?
last week on the way to work _comma_  i did not notice my wife had ran my car so low on gas and i ended up running out of gas on the freeway . 
on no! did you have to walk _comma_  or did you call for service?
a nice man stopped _comma_  help me push my car to the shoulder and even had a can of gas he let me use in his trunk .  talk about a nice guy . 
wow _comma_  you got lucky! did you give him a tip?
i got caught cheating on my test .  i feel so horrible . 
why did you feel you had to cheat? i am sure you could have passed if you had studied . 
i just wanted to make sure i passed .  but now i have a big   . 
well  _comma_   don t let this one situation define you .  use it as a learning experience and move on  _comma_   and do you best not to repeat it . 
i had an accident today and i never want to show my face again at work . 
that s so sad! what on earth happened?
i accidentally peed my pants when i was laughing .  
now that is quite embarrassing! what did your co workers say?
they all laughed and posted it on facebook . 
my daughter made straight a s all year .  i am so happy . 
that is wonderful!  she must be so proud of herself and i know you are proud of her .   its great that she likes learning so much . 
yes i agree .  i let her choose our vacation this summer .  she cried because she was so happy . 
awww _comma_  what a great idea!  that s so cute! where are you guys going?
i could never send my parents to a nursing home .  i look after them now . 
you are such a good person to do that!
thank you! they say they feel like they are the kids and it makes them feel young again . 
it s crazy how the tables turn!
i think i will never walk into the local grocery store again . 
why do you say that
it was raining today _comma_  and when i walked into the store i slipped and fell right on my face . 
oh no _comma_  were you okay
i can t show my face in the bank ever again!
oh my goodness  _comma_   what happened? did they find out you owe money to the local crime families? those bank employees need to mind their own business  _comma_   am i right!?
how did you guess? you are exactly right .  now they are talking about alerting the police!
that is absolutely unacceptable .  snitches get stitches _comma_  that s what i say .  tell me where they re at and i ll roll up on  em and tell  em what for .  just say the word .  i ve got your back . 
i need someone to stay with my elderly mother for a few hours in my home .  
have you asked your friends for family?
no one is available .  she asked someone that i don t know and they are coming .  i am a little uneasy . 
i would def feel that way . its hard when you dont know the person or can trust them
i guess i just have to hope for the best and hope i don t get robbed or worse . 
my husband just told me the best news ever!
oh yeah? and what news might that be?
my husband just signed with the nfl .  i never knew he was that good!
nice! did he sign up to be a waterboy?
so _comma_  i just found our my husband is cheating on me . 
oh my goodness _comma_  that s terrible!
i am soo mad .  i can t believe he did this after being married for    years . 
what do you plan on doing?
i don t think i will go outside in the dark ever again . 
uh oh .  did something happen?
yes _comma_  i was robbed at gun point while walking home from work . 
that must be traumatizing .  most people wouldn t want to go out alone after that .  it s understandable . 
i have been pacing waiting to hear back from walmart after my interview .  
do you think you will get the job?
not sure _comma_  but i really need this job to support my kids . 
i hope you end up getting it!
i like to watch all the music and guitar covers on youtube .   there s a lot of talented folks out there nowadays . 
oh definitely _comma_  youtube is a great platform for these talented people
yeah _comma_  it never ceases to amaze me the kinds of things you can see on youtube .   endless content to discover . 
yeah _comma_  my favorite is watching short comedy videos of my favorite drag queens
i like to watch either acoustic guitar covers or vocal covers .   makes me jealous i don t have the skills to do the same . 
i am still waiting to hear the results from the doctor . 
do you think there something wrong
they think i may have brain cancer .  i can t seem to even sit still waiting for that phone call . 
oh no thats terrible im sorry to hear that
i am waiting to find out if i really won the lottery . 
me too! i bought about a thousand dollars worth of tickets last night!
wow .  i spent      .    myself .  i hope it pays off!
you and i both! no matter who wins _comma_  let s promise to split the pot . 
i will be going on a once in a life time trip tomorrow . 
oh nice _comma_  where are you going?
i will be going on my first cruise .  
wow _comma_  i ve never been on a cruise before .  i think it sounds like a lot of fun
i can never thank my mom enough . 
why? what did she do?
she helped us pay off our house so it didn t go into foreclosure .  
she is a special woman . 
i am not sure how to address to my husband about how i feel about him getting a phone number from another girl . 
i would be downright furious .  start by smacking him across the face randomly at dinner .  that should be a good segway into the conversation . 
that is how i feel .  i don t think he understands how it makes me feel inside .  
oh    _comma_     he certainly will when he feels the hot    _comma_     guilty tears running down his face from that strong    _comma_     independent    _comma_     jealous filled slap!
i am still in shock at the damage yesterdays flood caused .  
was any of your stuff damaged?
yes _comma_  our whole house was swept out to sea . 
oh wow! i am sorry to hear that .  maybe you can go find it and sail it to go kill moby dick to make up for the damages . 
i know i got this job _comma_  just waiting for the conformation .  
exciting! are you moving to a new company?
no _comma_  this is the first job i have ever had just out of high school . 
oh fun! i m so excited for you .  try to learn as much as possible from this job and ask for career development opportunities!
i never thought i would see something this gross ever!
oh geez! what on earth was it!
i saw a guy pick a piece of chewed gum off the sidewalk and put it in his mouth . 
that is friggin revolting!!! i would have lost my lunch right then and there!
today _comma_  was the worst day ever!
no way .  what happened? if honestly  _comma_   almost all my days are like this .  so  _comma_   worst has become normal for me
that is so sad .  i was turned down for my promotion at work to someone with less experience than me .  
don t get it personally .  good performance will always catch other s attention .  just continue doing your work
i am pretty happy with my life right now . 
that s awesome! always good to be content with life . 
it took a long time .  but i always tell people to plan for the future! 
it s good to be prepared for anything because you never know what could happen . 
i never knew i would feel this much love having kids . 
definately! i have one daughter and twins on the way .  i foresee love overload .  how many do you have?
congrats .  i love every bit of motherhood .  i have   kids .  they are    _comma_     _comma_   and  
thanks _comma_  motherhood truly is amazing
do you felt sad or emotioned during your work
not really _comma_  do you?
some time i felt disgusted with my work
oh i m so sorry to hear that  _comma_   i hope it picks up for you  _comma_   maybe listen to a little music to lift your spirits
yes i love to hear music
i didn t think i would feel this bad for stealing diapers . 
oof _comma_  sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do i guess
i felt so bad i brought them back .  i am happy i wasn t arrested .  but it was only half a pack i brought back . 
well you tried to make things right _comma_  you re still a good person
do you feel that you are satisfied with your work
i can say that i am satisfied with where i am what i do and what its done for me .  are you?
great! i am very happy with work _comma_  i am loving it
im glad to hear that!
thank you so much
i would be in bad shape if i didn t pack extra clothes . 
what are you packing extra clothes for? did you go somewhere did something happen?
we went on vacation .  and we all ended up with the stomach virus so you can guess from there lol
what are you packing extra clothes for? did you go somewhere did something happen?
i am still shocked my husband bought tickets to the concert . 
what concert is it? are you excited to go?
super excited to see taylor swift! he knew i was a fan . 
oh my god  _comma_   i m so jealous  _comma_   she isn t coming to my city this time .  you re gonna have a great time
i just found out i was having twins .  i already have   kids . 
wow _comma_  that will be a busy house
yes  _comma_   i agree .  i was super worried  _comma_   but decided to think more positive and i know i will be able to handle it . 
that s a great attitude _comma_  i hope you and your family stay happy and healthy
i feel so bad lying to my husband . 
what did you lie about _comma_  are you going to tell him?
i might as well since i feel so bad .  i pretended to be sick because i didn t want to spend   days at my in law s house this holiday weekend . 
hahaha if anything that is excusable _comma_  noone like inlaws!
there have been more tornadoes in my area this year so far than any year in recent memory .  we have spent a lot of time in the basement . 
how scary! i m terrified thinking a tornado could pass by here
it s so much worse when the power is out and all we have is a few candles and flashlights . 
well i hope nothing crazy happens and you guys stay safe!
my husband threw me an unexpected party for my birthday!
wow _comma_  that s very nice of him! was there a lot of people there?
yes almost my entire family! the only one that wasn t there was my son .  he couldn t come because he had to work . 
that s too bad .  i hope you had a blast!
i did! we had pizza   _comma_    cake   _comma_    chips   _comma_    all kinds of goodies that i love . 
there is suppose to be a huge storm coming .  i went to the store and got supplies so i am ready . 
that s a good idea! it s always smart to be on the safe side . 
we usually don t have horrible storms so i never do it _comma_  but i have heard this one is going to be a bad one .   i just want to be ready
i ve done that as well where nothing ends up happening but i bought all this stuff .  you never know what could happen though . 
i am looking forward to going on vacation in october! i need a vacation
where are you going on vacation?
my husband and i are going to the smokeys .   i have been but he hasn t .  
that should be fun _comma_  what do you plan to do there?
i was walking through walmart and noticed people staring .  i went to the bathroom and to check my clothing and i had a huge brown stain on my rear! i sat in chocolate _comma_  i was moritified
that must of been horrible . 
i can t stop thinking about it .   i keep replaying the scene in my head _comma_  it was so bad . 
i am sure people forgot already . 
i am suppose to start a new job tomorrow .  i am not sure i am going to like it
what job is it?
i will be working at a daycare .  i love kids _comma_  but i am not sure i will like working with so many at once . 
only one way to find out . 
my son is getting ready to go into the military! i am so pleased with him
what branch of the military then?
the marines .  he has always wanted to join .   i am glad he is finally getting to .  
the marines is by far my favorite so good for him!
my electricity is out again! i pay a lot for the service _comma_  and i can never count on it .  it goes out when the wind blows!
oh no that s horrible .  have you complained to the electric company?
yes but i always get the same answer _comma_  we are working to improve the infrastructure .  blah blah .  i am seriously considering solar . 
i would too at this point .  it might be more reliable . 
i think i am going to have to serve on a jury and i am terrified
that will be no fun . 
no .   i hope it isn t a murder trial or something heartbreaking . 
don t you have to be selected first?
i can t believe i lost at bingo! i spent    dollars and didn t win a penny
that sucks! i hate losing money as well .  
yes _comma_  i swear there were   people sitting all around me that won several games .   it s just not fair . 
that s how i always feel at those things as well!
have you ever been to the zoo just to realize that animals can be just as good as humans?
i do enjoy the zoo and the animals .  i think they could be just as good . 
yes _comma_  i am happy somebody shares this with me . 
i think it s a good outlook . 
i almost adopted a child once  _comma_   but now i m glad i didn t do it  _comma_   sometimes we should stay rational . 
hopefully one day you might decide to choose otherwise or have a child of your own . 
i don t know if this is something i ll ever be ready for . 
it s a tough choice to make _comma_  and not everyone has to raise a child . 
have you ever mistaken a situation for something it is not and was ready for anything?
i can say that i have mistaken something for what it isnt .  but not sure about the ready for anything
it s just that the other day i mistaken a guard for a tour guide and almost got in a fight . 
almost? so the situation resolved itself?
i have an interview with a local ad agency tomorrow .  i hope i get it!
what kind of interview?
an interview for a job . 
really? that is cool
yesterday my family surprised me on my birthday
how exactly?
well i came back from work kind of sad because i thought nobody remembered my birthday and as soon as i went inside they screamed happy birthday  _comma_  not gonna lie i got really happy . 
i bet you needed help to take all the presents back home . 
i got into a wrong part of town the other day _comma_  i was glad to get out from there . 
oh my god _comma_  how did you get out of there?
i realized i could walk very fast if i want to . 
that sounds great . 
in the past and even today i always felt strong in unfamiliar situations . 
that s a great asset to have emotionally i think . 
i agree _comma_  although i don t really know if you can train yourself to be like that . 
yeah it might just be something you re born with . 
i have old cassette player and music on it is much better than what i hear on a radio today .  
i agree .  music used to have soul and good lyrics back in the day . 
yes _comma_  today it s just all about money and getting physical . 
hopefully music nowadays can take a note from the good old days and change their tune . 
yesterday i went to the town where i grew up 
how did that go? did it bring back a lot of memories?
it did _comma_  so much nostalgia!
im glad to hear that .  sounds like a great trip
so it was supposed to rain _comma_  but when i got out it was beautifully sunny . 
almost sounds like the erratic weather that we have here in georgia .   i don t mind the rain as long as i m inside .   the sun is beautiful but sometimes it can be brutal when it starts to heat up .   do you prefer sunny days?
sun is what makes me alive _comma_  so definitely yes . 
i have to be very careful in the sun .   my allergies and the sun don t mix too well .   i can tolerate the rain much better .   i love the sound of water . 
when i walk past old people i feel fortunate that i m still young . 
i can agree with that .  i do feel the effects of age creeping up on me though
yes  _comma_   but this part is inevitable  _comma_   for now let us enjoy our young years . 
def .  make the best of them
when i feel an urge to get a girlfriend _comma_  i simply remember how nice it is to be independent . 
it s good to explore your own interests and what makes you grow on your own . 
yes _comma_  i still think that there are good and bad sides in both of these cases . 
hopefully one day you will be willing to explore a relationship in a serious way . 
i get angry when people don t use trash cans . 
i once volunteered to pick up trash on the side of the road .  it s amazing how much people litter
good for you _comma_  instead of tickets this should be a punishment for everyone . 
i wish .  people might have more respect if they were forced to clean up other people s trash as well . 
when i wake up _comma_  the first thing i do is thank life for having another day to enjoy . 
are you in a dangerous place?
no i m not  _comma_   but in away we all are in a very dangerous place  _comma_   aren t we?
i suppose so .  it s great that you value life so much!
i was with my friend yesterday and by accident i spilled coffee on her laptop
oh no .  did it get ruined?
i got so embarrassed but thankfully it didn t get ruined
close call .  i once spilt tea over my laptop and the keys were all sticky for a while
my grandmother passed away last week . 
really? so sorry for the lose
i m really sad because she used to help me with everything 
was she sick?
yeah .  heart problems
i entered a contest and i didn t win . 
that s a bummer .  it s never fun to not win . 
no it isn t .  i felt like i put a lot of effort into it too . 
hopefully you ll have better luck next time!
we changed our internet provider last week and the connection is horrible . 
that s not good _comma_  we ended up lucky with who we have 
i wish we did too .  but it s okay 
maybe you can find another one or go back to your previous company .  have you double checked with the company to make sure everything is ok? 
i haven t  _comma_  i guess i ll do it later today
i was one of three finalists for a job promotion where i work .  i have more than double the other candidates experience _comma_  so i feel really good about my odds . 
that s wonderful! i hope you will get that promotion! what do you do?
i am a electrical engineer with more than    years experience .  i have a really good feeling that i am going to get this job . 
good luck! whenever you get that promotion we should go celebrate
i can t wait for summer to finish  _comma_  i love winter so much
i agree _comma_  plus i love making snowmen! 
snowmen are my favourite! 
i always get sad though when they melt 
last week i was walking and talking to one of my coworkers and i stepped into a hole i did not see on the job site .  i ended up falling and spilling hot coffee all over myself in front of our client . 
ouch! did they try to help you back up?
yeah  _comma_   my coworker did  _comma_   but the damage had already been done .  pretty big shot to the ego to look like such a fool in front of your client . 
of course! well _comma_  at least you also looked human .  we all make mistakes . 
we have had a record number of tornadoes in my area so far this year .  my son really hates going into the basement while it is storming outside . 
that sounds really scary!  is your son afraid or is he use to it?
he is only three _comma_  so it is pretty scary for him each time .  i hate to see him that way . 
i would hate that as well .  i hope he learns to cope with it . 
i had a client meeting in dallas _comma_  and as i was driving to the airport i heard there was going to be a lot of storms we d be flying through .  i ended up renting a car because i hate flying so much in just calm weather . 
that is a lot of extra money to spen  _comma_   but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it .   have you ever looked into calming medications  _comma_   or meditation to help your nerves?
i have _comma_  but they only cut down the anxiety instead of making it go away completely .  something about hurdling towards earth at a rapid pace in a large metal box alarms me . 
i completely understand that .   my mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying _comma_  but she did hypnosis and it really helped .  
last month _comma_  this area got pounded with rainfall .  my entire home town was flooded and declared a disaster area . 
wow .  that s intense .  did your home get any damage?
no  _comma_   i move away from there some years ago  _comma_   but i hate seeing the place i grew up basically destroyed now . 
yeah .  i feel for you .  it hurts to lose things like that . 
my birthday isn t for another two weeks _comma_  but my wife gave me my gift early yesterday .  she bought me a brand new laptop because mine was getting old and slow . 
that is awesome .   happy birthday!  what kind is it?
it s a dell with a i  and   gigs of ram _comma_  even has a nvidia graphics card .  she pretty much know what i wanted . 
is that a gaming computer?
last month our area received record amounts of rainfall .  the river that is down from my house backed up so bad it flooded my entire house destroying practically everything . 
sorry to hear about that .  are the damages covered by an insurance?
yes   _comma_    we had insurance that is going to cover it   _comma_    but it still sucks start from ground zero .  plus   _comma_    insurance can t really replace some things . 
i understand .  it is always difficult to start from ground zero .  good luck . 
my ex took me to six flags and wanted me to ride on a very high roller coaster . 
interesting . did you do it
yeah _comma_  but only because he was getting mad at me .  i hate heights and i was very unsure about it . 
lol why would he get mad . but did you have fun in the end
my husband is so lucky i cheat on him like he did . 
why do you cheat on him?
i could have .  but i didn t .  he cheated on me actually . 
oh i see _comma_  why are you still with him then?
damn  _comma_   i really wanted my ebay package to arrive today  _comma_   but it didn t . 
i know how you feel .  are you also spoiled by amazone prime?
indeed _comma_  i thought everything came this early . 
haha _comma_  i know .  especially when i purchase firearms related things like ammunition .  it has to ship ground .     week for shipping?!?!   rage . 
that sucks! i guess ground shipping takes ages in large countries .  
yeah  _comma_   the us is huge  _comma_   landmass wise . 
i really really wished it would come today _comma_  i was even sat at the window looking for postal trucks and everything!
you can always leave them an angry review online
i got so mad at my dog the other day . 
what did your dog do?
he saw the rabbit that lives under my shed eating some grass in my yard _comma_  and decided to scare it and chase it away . 
oh no _comma_  well at least he didnt hurt the rabbit . 
you re right _comma_  it could have been much worse .  i am thankful in a way . 
i am so upset about what happened yesterday .  
what happened to you?
i accidentally can off the road avoiding a deer and totaled my new car . 
that sucks sorry to hear .  are you okay?
i went to my first concert this weekend i seen beyonce herself it was so awesome .  
oh nice! i bet you ll remember that for a long time
yes and i will it was great and her voice and the singers really moved me because even in person it was lovely .  
i ve never been to a concert .  i should go see one like you!
this past weekend i found out a friend of mine i went to school with passed away .  he had a heart attack while he slept . 
that s terrible! how does that make you feel?
it makes me feel old .  i mean i am not that old _comma_  but to see people my age passing away really makes me think about my own mortality .  
that is the reality of life _comma_  unfortunately! that s what you have to enjoy life now . 
i am upset i have to tell my daughter her pet died . 
that is terrible .  how long have you had this pet?
she had it for   years .  but i feel i must be honest with her . 
honesty is vey important .  i hope she will not feel too bad . 
i can t believe my husband planned a trip all by him .  
where are you going?
i am still shocked he planned a cruise for   days . 
that is going to be so fun!
i start my diet monday and let s just say i am not ready to start lol . 
i am never ready .  which diet are you trying
the keto diet and i have started looking up meal preps and workouts but as of non i am so not arranged to start this up i need more time . 
i think my favorite and easiest would have to be atkins but still alot of prep to get started
i have to look into that one never heard of it thanks . 
your welcome _comma_  and i will check out keto . 
my dogs are my life more like my family i love them . 
my kitties are my family too .  animals are the best . 
yes they are you can t be lonely with them they are just so warmhearted and loving always .  
exactly! i am glad you have them
i can t believe my husband hid a talent her had from me for    years .  
that sounds interesting .  what was it? and how did you find out? and why did he hide it! if you don t mind me asking _comma_  of course . 
i happen to come across all his drawings .  he is as good as most professional artists! 
oh i see .  well that s a pretty positive talent then _comma_  huh? maybe you should encourage him to keep doing it .  maybe he misses it .  you could get him a present for his birthday or christmas that was related to drawing tools pencils and all that . 
i am starting back dancing ballet next month it s been a while since i last danced .  
how is that working out for you
a little rusty but i know when i get in the class and hit the floor with my shoes i am more then positive it will be great . 
practice makes perfect
i hate i keep receiving double bills every month from comcast . 
omg i would be upset too .  how many times have you called them to fix it? 
every month they shut off my service because i didn t pay the second bill .  then i have to go all over this month after month of them fixing their errors . 
sounds like a nightmare! total .  
when i see my wedding picture around the house i always think back to that day . 
does it make you feel happy about your life since then?
yeah _comma_  just makes me think back to those times and how it was so different from now . 
well at least you ll always have your memories as time goes on . 
my favorite football team lost their preseason game and i talked so much smack to everyone saying they was going to win .  
that s why i don t watch sports lol we always make fun of our uncle because he talks a lot of smack and die hard redskins fan
i love the jaguars i was ashamed i talk a lot of smack to everyone lol i guess me and your uncle need to stay quite next time lol . 
lol no! you shouldn t! that s the best part! talking smack to each other
you re right i m going to be even louder next time . 
i dislike a careless driver and this morning i was furious with one by my daughters elementary school .  
oh i know how you feel! i wish there was some kind of hotline where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around
i wish to and the school zone light was flashing but they was driving past the    mph minimum a child could have got hurt . 
thats awful! people should be arrested for that
i lost some money yesterday in the parking lot i am still so unhappy about that . 
oh no!  devastating! i m so sorry . 
i know it is i lost      and was actually on the way to pay my car insurance with that can t believe i was careless .  
that makes me feel ill so i m sure you were sick .  i hope somehow you make it up!
i decided to buy my son s supplies for kindergarten _comma_  they wanted very specific brands counts . 
that could turn out expensive .  did they need a particular brand for a particular reason?
i m not sure _comma_  it was just on the list .   i had a really hard time finding them . 
that s annoying _comma_  maybe they should provide links for you next time?
i just got out of a job interview for a customer assistant role . 
how did it go?
i think it went well  _comma_   apart from a few mistakes  _comma_   hopefully i got the job . 
that is great .   interviews are very intimidating .  
i recently had to babysit my cousins _comma_  it was a disaster . 
oh no _comma_  what happened?
they made a mess everywhere in the house .  really was not a good way to earn money . 
there has o be an easier way .   i have always avoided babysitting because i just don t like other peoples kids that much . 
yeah   _comma_    kids are super annoying to deal with   _comma_    i ve learned a lesson   _comma_    ha!
yesterday was my birthday and i knew my girlfriend had a surprise planned for me _comma_  but no idea what it would be . 
so i am guessing she gave you a good surprise?
an awesome one! all my best friends were there and i got some pretty sweet gifts!
she s must be a keeper then . 
i definitely think so!
against all odds _comma_  i won two tickets to go to a music festival last summer . 
that is awesome .   i have never won anything in my life .   what festival was it?
that s a shame! it was a festival called pooza fest .  many punk rock and acoustic shows!
congratulations!  did you have a good time?
i did _comma_  thanks for asking .  i went with my older brother and a few of his friends .  it was a blast!
i won a pair of tickets to go to rockfest this summer . 
wow thats awesome .   how did you win them? i never win anything cool . 
i won them by sharing and liking a facebook page! unfortunately _comma_  none of my friends could go and so i ended up staying home instead . 
aww that stinks _comma_  i hope you were at least able to sell them and make some money
they were tied to my name _comma_  so i couldn t even sell them .  oh well!
my coworker constantly calls in .   the last couple weeks he had only come in on fridays .   we made a friendly bet last night if he would come in today and i was pretty shocked when he actually was here on a wednesday . 
that is crazy! how is he still employed?
he went on disability .   he actually was my old roommate so i know he just doesnt like working but at the same time has anxiety issues so he can go that route to not get fired .   it definitely doesnt look good for him though . 
that makes people look bad .  i have severe anxiety and still go to work .  i get that things are hard but .  its bad to never come in . 
i told my best friends about an incident in where i self harmed recently . 
i am glad that you spoke out and shared your feelings .  its not healthy to self harm and pent up your feelings . 
agreed .  i was anxious and scared to share _comma_  but i m glad i did; they were really supportive and it s helped me a lot . 
thats what best friends are for _comma_  after all .  i hope things have gotten better for you . 
they have  _comma_   ever since i started taking meds and speaking to my doctor and social worker .  this is also the reason why i think you should confide in a professional  _comma_   it can really turn your life around and you deserve the best!
my dog keeps going into my garbage and throwing it all onto the floor!
gesh _comma_  that s frustrating .  i had a dog that used to do that too .  had to get a trash can with a lid . 
that s a good idea _comma_  i just haven t found a nice looking one yet .  it s really frustrating but i think i ll just get whatever i can at this point . 
we even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it .  hopefully that will work for now until you figure something out . 
thanks for the suggestions _comma_  i m going to give them a shot!
an eagle landed on my flag pole in my front yard last week!
that is awe inspiring _comma_  very patriotic .   did you get pictures?
i did .  not the best pictures because i was using my phone but still _comma_  it was really surprising . 
i m sure  _comma_   that isn t something you see every day  _comma_   or would even expect to see ever .   i m glad you got it documented . 
i ve been putting off my exam studying by being productive in other areas of my life . 
well _comma_  that s great .  but you probably should study as well .  school is very important . 
yeah .  i m pretty upset in myself for procrastinating _comma_  but also proud of what i ve been accomplishing .  i m so conflicted in my emotions . 
yeah _comma_  that does sound like a conflicting situation .  well at least you re doing something positive . 
i was helping my girlfriend pack up her sons toys and he had a lite brite .   i used to have a lite brite and loved playing with it when i was younger .   it brought back some good memories . 
i bought a lite brite from goodwill about a year ago .  it was one of the remakes from recent years but we had fun with it . 
his is a new version too . those toys that were older were sooo much better but at least kids today can have an idea of how awesome they were back then!
nope _comma_  they only know how to touch screens . 
my girlfriend moved in last weekend .   i really feel like this is the right move for the next steps for us and our relationship . 
that s great! how long have you two been together?
almost a year .   we re a little bit older though so i dont feel like its a rush into a relationship sort of thing . 
you learn a lot about someone when you move in with them _comma_  so if you feel comfortable in your relationship i think that s actually rather prudent . 
a friend of mine hadn t taken out her garbage in weeks . 
oh i ll bet that didn t smell pleasant . 
you got that right .  also there were so many fruit flies around it _comma_  i felt sick to my stomach . 
oh gross .   i hope she won t do that again . 
i really hate moving .  my girlfriend just moved in last weekend .  im really happy she moved in but im also super happy that the move is finally over . 
moving is the worst .   all those boxes .   ugh .  i hope i dont have to do it for awhile
haha _comma_  the boxes are still being unpacked and probably will be for the next couple weeks .   i m hoping we dont have to again for a while!
i hope its good that she moved in with you .   things must be serious
i was lucky enough to get an opportunity to volunteer for one of my favorite companies at a convention . 
that sounds pretty amazing _comma_  what convention was it?
otakuthon      .  it was so amazing _comma_  i ended up doing really great!
i m so happy for you _comma_  it sounds like it was a wonderful opportunity!
i was looking at my old photo album today _comma_  it brought back a lot of memories
that is always so much fun .  which ones made you feel the most nostalgic?
the one where i was eating ice cream _comma_  oh god i miss eating ice cream
i know how you feel .  i feel guilty about indulging in ice cream the older i get . 
 i told my family i wanted nothing a few christmas  ago _comma_  even if i knew they d get me something anyways . 
oh yea? and what did they get you?
i got an xbox one _comma_  and i had no idea how much fun i d have until i received it . 
oh nice .   those are fun .   i love playing video games
i went for a run last month and the most unexpected thing happened to me . 
oh yes? what happened?
i was running on a road with a sidewalk _comma_  i turned the corner and saw a deer staring at me .  can t believe i found one in my small suburban neighborhood . 
oh _comma_  that must have been so precious! we had deer around where i used to live   they re gorgeous creatures . 
my little brother was stuck gaming on a horrendously slow computer for years . 
that s not much fun .  did he get a new one recently?
kind of .  i built myself a new pc _comma_  and gave him my previous one .  i re built it for him and made sure everything would work perfectly!
wow _comma_  you re smart and kind! i wouldn t know where to start re .  building a computer .  well done!
thanks! seeing him smile as he played with high frame rates and nice graphics brought me such joy .  
what a nice thing to do .  you seem to get on very well with your little bro . 
i love my siblings so much _comma_  they re the best . 
i love my brother _comma_  too .  he s a great guy .  how lucky we are!
my older sister stole money from me . 
do you know it was her for sure? that is horrible that you cant trust your own sister . 
yeah  _comma_   no one else in the household would ever do something like that .  the worst thing is  _comma_   my parents did nothing about it . 
that is horrible .  it sucks that you have to keep such a close eye on your things in front of family .  i would be so mad . 
today i woke from an amazing dream which i had  _comma_   it brought back a lot of amazing memories  _comma_   memories which i wish i could go back to . 
i hear you! that sounds almost worse then a nightmare as it sounds like it s stuff you miss!
yeah  _comma_   but at the same time  _comma_   it motivated me for the day which was nice
thats great! what kind of stuff was in the dreams?
to keep on dreaming and follow my heart  _comma_   in other words  _comma_   me chasing after what i love
last week as we were finishing up on a job site _comma_  the client was over joyed at the way we had done the installation .  i couldn t help but keep smiling since it was my design . 
that has got to be one of the best feelings .  i love being complimented . 
yes _comma_  it is great to see something you designed be put into a working model .  
you should be proud of yourself .  keep pushing it and work and it will all pay off . 
i was just like the usual  _comma_   working on my website  _comma_   and then i saw a disgusting advert which was about society
dont put too much weight into those advertisements .  sometimes they are just there to get a rise out of you . 
yeah _comma_  but i wish it wasn t like this
i know that feeling .  sometimes they can really get under your skin . 
my girlfriend moved in over the weekend .   we have a ton of boxes to unpack but i am thinking it should be something that can be done in the next couple weeks . 
thats nice to hear .  hopefully it makes you two happy .  i would just unpack the necessities first and move from there . 
i think thats the plan .   after those were just slowly going to go from room to room until everything is done .   not a huge rush and were both super happy . well i am .   i m assuming she is too!
sounds like a plan! make sure to hydrate properly because unpacking is cumbersome work!
today i woke up  _comma_   and i realised that i am more than content with my life  _comma_   it made me happy and peaceful 
that would be a great feeling .   did something happen to make you feel more content?
yes _comma_  i just realised i have everything i ever wanted in my life
thats so awesome! congrats! i am hoping to get there soon .   i have a lot to be thankful for but i know i need to work on just a little bit before i am fully content . 
im going to chicago in a couple weeks .   i havent been there for about    years so i m really looking forward to it . 
oh nice! i know that feeling _comma_  is it home? what made you think about going there?
it isnt home but i went there for family trips when i was younger .  my girlfriends friend is having a baby shower and lives there so i m tagging along and were going to make a long weekend out of it!
nice! hope you enjoy your weekend and make sure to make the most out of it!
i really don t like randomly pumping into old friends   _comma_    it get s me nervous   _comma_    and i saw one of my old friend s today and  i was surprised   _comma_    to say the least
yeah it can be akward some times specially if you dont know what to talk about
yeah  _comma_   so i tried to look for a way out before i admit defeat  _comma_   but then i realised there was no way out and so i talked to them in the end
yeah a little chat to an old friend cannot hurt did you enjoy the conversation?
yeah it wasn t bad in the end _comma_  just awkward 
well im glad it did not go in the wrong direction
a co worker of mine was fired at work
do you think they deserved it?
no _comma_  their performance seemed to be good
well as they say _comma_   better them than you 
today my wife worked super hard for our future and made an amazing progress 
that is wonderful it is good to hear you guys are doing good progress
thank you _comma_  in a few months everything will work out perfectly
that is good hard work and determination will always pay off
today i was walking outside and then suddenly had a moment where i realised how amazing my life is
thats a really good feeling isnt it? anything in particular?
just how i have everything i ever wanted _comma_  and that made me feel very grateful 
thats awesome .   im glad youre happy .   keep the positive energy flowing
i got accused of something at work today . 
im guessing it wasnt your fault? do you know whos it was?
i wasn t even at work the day it happened _comma_  yet they still insist it was me . 
that sounds like sabotage to me .  is there any way to prove you werent there? i would be furious . 
i guess i can get them to check their logs . 
i watched out the window for visitors to my house today _comma_  it was saddening . 
did they not ever come?
no one came to visit . 
man that s a bummer .   i d visit you but that would be weird . 
just a little _comma_  but i feel so lonely it might be worth it . 
today my wife and i decorated our house and made amazing designs on our bedroom walls _comma_  i am so proud of us 
that is awesome .   what kind of designs are there?
a rabbit near her and a owl near my side of the bed and random marks everywhere else
that is very very cool .   i would love something like that in mine
work was fun _comma_  my manager told everyone about the amazing work i put in
its always nice getting praise and compliments .   i hope everyone was proud of you
they are _comma_  and i am very proud of myself
thats great .   i hope you get a raise too
my dog was bit by something and had a huge front lip and looked really sad .   i felt terrible for him and was doing anything i could to help . 
like what?
i took him to the vet who checked it over and determined he was bit .   they suggested benedryl and rest for a couple days until it went down . 
wow that s really compassionate of you
i was looking though the window today and the beautiful sight outside the window gave me a positive outlook on life and made me realise to work harder for my future
are you feeling much more motivated now? what do you want to achieve?
i am feeling motivated _comma_  i want to be financially free and continue to learn and develop myself even more
thats such fantastic goals to aim for in life! i wish you all the best .  
it was my birthday today _comma_  so my family organised a party that i didn t know about . 
happy birthday .   that was so nice of them .   i bet you were surprised .   was there cake?
oh yeah _comma_  the surprise was the cake being thrown in my face!
haha that sounds quite messy _comma_  but i hope that it atleast tasted good
money is such a weird thing   _comma_    still don t agree with this ideology but it is the way things have been inherited since the start   _comma_    i just wish it wasn t so controlling   _comma_    i am worried about my future income  
i agree _comma_  you need money for everything these days and it controls us . 
yeah i will continue to work hard on my finance and make sure it doesn t control me
me too _comma_  i try not to worry about money so much .  there s more to life than that . 
my work is going well and i am happy with the outcome with everything and i am feeling hopeful
i hope your work continues on the path you want and expect . 
thank you and i hope you do so too _comma_  let s work hard!
hard work is supposed to payoff _comma_  right?
yup
i am feeling very guilty recently as i am putting a lot of stress on my body and not sleeping enough _comma_  it s making me feel very bad
i know how that feels and it can make you sick very fast .  do whatever you can to try and get enough sleep . 
i know i should _comma_  but it s been very rough recently with work and all
if you get sick you won t be able to work at all so please take care of yourself . 
i won t listen to anyone anymore _comma_  what i know now is that i trust my guts! that always works out well for me 
what happened?
as usual i decided to listen to my father    _comma_     he told me to come back to my home city and said he has a job there    _comma_     so i could quit mine    _comma_     but when i went there he lied    _comma_     and now i don t have a job
wow _comma_  that s cruel . 
i anticipate my future _comma_  if i continue to work always and chase after my dreams i will climb that mountain  
yeah that is a pretty good mindset to go by . 
thank you _comma_  i hope it goes well for you too
just keep it up and you will go far . 
i believe in my abilities more now _comma_  i am surprised but today i managed to write amazing   line code to do the base    decode process
that is great! i m also learning to write code . 
oh really? what language on?
html css java .  i m excited about a career change . 
i was nervous for my mom s surprise party
why is that?
not sure if everyone who rsvp d would show up .  people are so flaky these days . 
oh god yes i know what you mean _comma_  any ideas what you wanna do ?
i decided to go a new route home from school today _comma_  but it didn t turn out as planned . 
uhoh _comma_  did you get lost?
no _comma_  it just took me somewhere dodgy . 
oh that is scary .   i hope you were ok .   make sure your doors are locked
good idea _comma_  i won t be stumbling down that dark alleyway again!
i was able to get my car fixed
what was wrong with it
engine issues _comma_  i m praying it will last a bit longer now
good luck! we just had our mini cooper blow its engine yesterday  .      .  k to replace 
today i listened to one of my old time favourite music and it moved my emotions and made me joyful
well music does have a really cathartic effect on people . 
yup _comma_  it s also a digital drug 
he can have a great impact on your brain and feeling that is for sure
oh god today! my friend stole my laptop as a prank and gave it back to me late at night

he should be ashamed for himself _comma_  did he say why he did it?
no we haven t seen him or he won t return none of the family calls he took our      and disappeared _comma_

i cannot even imagine
sunflower seed and sunny weather is a good combination for a relaxed day do you afree?
sounds very relaxing to me _comma_  as long as my allergies don t act up . 
that s right we have to keep those in mind . 
i always keep some propolis pills with me just in case . 
yesterday _comma_  i was in a situation where i had to stand up for myself . 
what happened that made you have to do that?

my girlfriend s cat randomly walks over my head in the middle of my sleep . 
oof _comma_  i hope that doesn t wake you up
it does  _comma_   and i get so upset .  apparently she doesn t ever do it to my girlfriend  _comma_   only when i come over . 
maybe it doesn t fell very comfortable with having you over and doesn t have any other way of expressing itself
my girlfriend and i have birthdays   days apart . 
that s cool .   do you celebrate both of them on the same day?
we do! exchanging gifts makes it feel like christmas in the summer and it made me so happy . 
haha i bet .   that s pretty awesome!  
so today i let my co worker draw my blood knowing she is a novice!
oh no .  did something bad happen?
it actually went well .  i felt i could give her the benefit of the doubt considering she has been doing really well recently .  
that;s great .  i have always been nervous no matter who drew my blood . 
i agree! i    _comma_   m the same way   _comma_    but even more since she is new   _comma_    but i had confidence in her 
she is going to be great at that job
yeah she is .  i knew the manager done well when she hired her and this proves it .  i know i can wean her from shadowing me now .  
i went to call a patient back to be seen and i addressed them as mrs and the person that walked up was a male .

he didnt get upset .  he said it happens alot _comma_  but i can feel my face get red!
i d be super embarassed _comma_  too!
yes it was very embarrassing! we both laughed at it .  
my dad came home from a bar really drunk one night _comma_  and started instigating fights with everyone in the household . 
wow  _comma_   that s horrible  _comma_   i hope he calmed down after and apologized to everyone
unfortunately  _comma_   no .  despite him scaring everyone  _comma_   he did not care . 
yikes  _comma_   i would definitely stage an intervention with the rest of your family  _comma_   let him understand it s not okay
i agree _comma_  i wish it were that easy .  at least he s cut down on the excessive drinking and we get along kind of fine now .  it s better than nothing right?
when i was a kid _comma_  my friends brought their beyblades to school to play
i remember those
they were awesome and i wanted one so badly _comma_  but my parents could not afford it .  i felt very bitter towards my friends for a while after . 
i never had one .  i didnt know they were expensive
i had my review today at work! it went really well since the doctor has been giving me compliments!
that s great! i hope you keep getting good reviews like that . 
yeah im very happy to know what comes next _comma_  since i will find out how much of a raise i will get from this .  i cant wait!
that s awesome .  how much do you anticpate the raise to be?
im hoping alot _comma_  but im overjoyed about it!
my girlfriend recently found herself a new hobby in sewing
oh thats cool _comma_  is she good ?
she s super talented .  she made a few dresses and cosplay within a month .  
oh thats cool
yeah! i was surprised she could pull it off in such a short time . 
i put a lot of effort and time into getting into a college program i wanted to be in . 
oh that sounds like it will be very rewarding!
unfortunately _comma_  i had to switch majors; the program was too difficult to stay in and my mental health was deteriorating . 
a tough situation but at least you were able to realize and adapt!
my sister leaves her clothes all over the living room . 
oh god .  the living room is shared .  she should just leave the messiness in her room . 
i agree completely! i get so irritated and i always tell her to clean up after herself _comma_  but she seems so very lackadaisical .  
how old is she?
she just turned    _comma_  so there s really no excuse . 
my girlfriend s cat is sick with cancer . 
i m so sorry to hear that .  how old is the cat?
only a couple of years old .  it s so upsetting to think that she won t make it for much longer . 
all you can do is make sure she s not in too much pain as she goes . 
last night my date decided to keep checking out the hot girl at the table next to us .  
i hope you walked out right then and there!
i didnt .  i kept on with the date .  she was very pretty and well dressed .  she drove a nice care .  i was kind of envious of it .  
ah that was really disrespectful of her though .  that s not someone you d want to date long term . 
yeah i agree .  at the moment i was just envying her look .  i wish i could have what she did .  
the new girl at work is doing really well considering she has not experience .  i m shocked!
that is good to hear .  she should be a big help a lot quicker than normal then . 
i agree! everyone including me were quite shocked byt it .  
that should bode well for her and her future there though _comma_  so it was a good surprise!
yes it was .  we all didnt think she woudl do well so fast .  took us by suprise .  
after a year of being single i decided to start dating again .  
how has it been going?
its very boring since im usally home by myself alot .  now that iim starting to date it wont be so boring .  
that is good _comma_  hopefully you find your soulmate . 
yes i agree .  i live alone and are new to the city so it can be very boring .

thanks! i feel and have confidence it will be a good raise!
my boyfriend came home from his trip early .  i wasn t expecting him home for another two days!
that s great! you must be happy!
i was! it was very unexpected and exciting .  although _comma_  i was hoping to have time to clean the place up before he got home . 
how come he came home early?
i took my neice to volunteer at a homeless shelter this past weekend .  she showed alot of compassion and love for the homless and needy .  
that s really thoughtful of you .  do you typically do things like that?
well i volunteer to help abused and battered kids .  i wanted to show her things like this .  i know she can be a good loving person .  
perhaps i should find the local shelter in my community and do the same .  i have never done that before and i feel like i should be giving back to those less fortunate in some capacity . 
it makes you feel very good with yourself to be able to do things like this .  i love and cherish those moments .  
my boyfriend came home from his trip two days early! 
yay! do you guys have free time to spend together now?
yes .  i m very excited since i haven t seen him in two weeks . 
that sounds great _comma_  you should make him dinner to surprise him back!
i was so upset today because   people decided to block traffic because of an argument .  
how long did that last for?
for a good    minutes .  at that it was during rush hour .  everybody was so mad at them .  
why didn t you tell them to move?
we all were honking and yelling at them _comma_  but they didnt pay no mind .  how inconsiderat of them .  
a few years back i moved to a new state .   now my childhood best friends and i live in different parts of the country and i don t know anyone really where i am . 
you must really miss them . 
i really do .   i mean we re in constant contact over the internet through instant messaging and video calls .   but it s not often that we all can get together and see each other in person . 
yea .  seeing each other on a screen definitely can t beat being with each other in person . 
definitely .   we ve talked about making plans to visit each other but it s hard to find the time to organize it . 
my boyfriend unexpectedly came home from his trip two days early!
did he catch you doing something crazy?
no _comma_  thankfully i was just eating .  
thats good lol
my coworkers last day of work was today .  im so upset she is leaving .  
that s so sad .  do you have any other friends there?
yeah i do _comma_  but she was the one i was closest to .  yes i was very sad . 
i am so sorry for you .  perhaps you can hang with her after your workdays?
yeah maybe we can do that .  its not the same though .  
i cant wait for friday! i go on vacation to new york!
new york is a fun place to visit . 
i agree .  i never been there so im so happy!
you will have a blast . 
yes i will! .  i cant wait!
so my hair dressed ruined my hair! im so mad!

actually i had to shave my head off .  she used new product that burnt my hair! 
yikes! i would ask for a refund for sure
yes! im so mad at her .  she knows better! i cant beleive this!
so i lost    lbs onmy diet and last night i ate a whole large pizza!

right _comma_  but i d say once isn t too bad as long you stay on track . 
i agree .  ill do my best not too .  i feel horrible eating a whole pizza .  i will pay for it tomorrow .  
i remember when my friends were helping me move out of our hometown .   we were riding in the moving truck and it came time to drop them off and say goodbye .   we all felt terrible . 
i would feel terrible too .  where did you move to?
i moved to a town about       minutes away _comma_  but at that point we were so used to seeing each other every day of our lives .   it was hard to get used to . 
i ve moved almost half a dozen times in my life before _comma_  so i completely understand .  those were rough times . 
yeah _comma_  it s always a big hassle having to pick up and go like that .   there s so much to take care of and do before you make the actual move . 
the manager the store was very mean and rude to the employees .  i could not beleive it .  
that sucks  _comma_   imagine being in an environment like that all day  _comma_   i would go crazy
i agree .  it made me sick to my stomach seeing it .  i feel bad for them!
i guess some people are just really rude _comma_  no matter what position you put them in
yeah .  it makes me wanna puke thinking about how mean he was!
last night my gps asked me to make a right down a dark and scary road .  
it s hard to trust a gps .  i have heard a lot of stories about people being steered the wrong way .  please tell me you didn t do it . 
i was very nervous and doubting to do it .  i actually did and it wasnt that bad
i am so glad that it didn t turn out bad for you .  
me too .  at first i wasnt going to _comma_  but i didnt want to get lost .  
i finally told my friend i was into him .  he didnt take it too well .  
what did he do  _comma_  how did he react ?
he rejected me and told me not to every call him again .  im so embarrassed .  i should have known better .  
well he is the one missing out and  i m sure your very worthy of attention from some better . 
maybe .  i just feel bad and embarrassed about it .  i should known better not to mess up our friendship .  
last night my neice placed  th at her dance performance .  she was so upset and so was i
why was she upset? depending on how many people entered _comma_  fifth could be really good . 
there were    girls .  we worked very hard and felt she would place top   but what an outcome it was to be  th .  
that s still really good! she did better than    other people .  
i agree . im proud of her _comma_  but she was very upset at the judges .  
i am very excited to not have any plans this weekend .  it s going to be so nice to relax for two whole days . 
nice! i bet you cant wait! do you anticipate to releax or do things to catch up?
just relaxing this weekend .  
very nice! i bet its going to be a good happy weekend .  
my best friend has won those taco bell playstation   giveaways twice so far .   i wish i could be that lucky sometimes . 
dang _comma_  and here i thought i was lucky winning a free soft drink in that contest .  maybe we have to pool our efforts together and try to win us something big?
i know _comma_  man just got together and buy like    boxes and cross our fingers .   and another thing was he got it on his first try both times . 
why stop at   ? we ought to get    ! we need to show your friend and evil corporate taco bell who is boss and nab us some consoles!
haha  _comma_   that s the spirit!  win us some systems  _comma_   sell them off and use the money to buy more boxes . 
my nephew asked me to use my car this weekend for a drivers ed class .  
did you let him?
we have been practicing together in my car  _comma_  so i feel i can let him .  
you are good to allow him to borrow the car . 
yeah .  i feel he wont let me down .  
im planning on going sky diving this weekend! 
wow _comma_  i really like to do that .  i hope you will enjoy it . 
i dont know .  i hate heights _comma_  so im very nervous about it
ah ok .  if you try once you will be alright next time . 
i dont think i will ever not be scared of heights .  the thought of it makes me have the chills!
my roommate leaves leftovers in the fridge and they get moldy . 
that sounds revolting! have you said anything to him about it?
no .  i m not very confrontational .  and our lease is up in two months anyway so i m just going to wait it out . 
that sounds like a good plan .  perhaps you should request a formal resume from any potential roommates for your future abode . 
i was at the library today and was trying to study _comma_  but this lady across the table was smacking her gum very loud .  
did you ask her to stop it or did you have to move away from her?
well the library is very small so limited seats so i had to sit there and listen to it .  i was so frusterated
that was very rude of her to do that _comma_  some people just have no manners . 
yah i agree .  i could understand if it was not so quiet and an open place .  i can still hear it in my ear now!
so this weekend im going to do a marathon .  i have worked very hard to get myself ready for it
that s so exciting! have you run a marathon before?
i never have .  i think all this time i been practicing will pay off . 
that s good _comma_  i hope you do well! how did you prepare?
i joined cross fit and did alot of cardio work outs . i think this helped me for it . 
my boyfriend came home from his trip two days early! 
what a nice surprise! did something happen or did he miss you!?
his business trip wrapped up a few days earlier than planned . 
i see . i bet you and him are happy to be able to spend a little time together .  
i doubt i will get any sleep waiting for tomorrow . 
i m sorry to hear .  why is that?
i am finally getting to take the kids to disneyland! 
oh _comma_  well that is a fine thing indeed! i would be  jumping up and down!
 i had to go out of town by myself for three weeks .  it was hard not being able to talk to anyone i knew .  
sounds pretty lonely .  did you meet or make some friends while out of town?
no _comma_  i was too busy focusing on work while i was there . 
ah i see .  staying focused is hard _comma_  especially when your lonely . 
my neice didnt get into nursing school . she worked so hard for this .  i feel bad for her . 
that s horrible! is she going to try again?
yeah she is .  she is going to retake some classes she made a b in .  the look on her face after she found out was pricelss . 
it must have been awful to see that in someone you care about .  i m glad she s not giving up . 
yeah thats what i said .  its like the world ended when she found out _comma_  but she is doing better now . 
i cant wait for this weekend! im leaving for new york!
wow  _comma_  thats great .  you must be loving it
yeah i cant wait .  i never been _comma_  so i cant sleep thinking about it . 
you must get a good sleep now to enjoy the new york later

i will cross mine too! i hope ya ll win it big . 
we hope we do to!
last night while driving home i fell asleep at the wheel .  
omg . that had to be so scary . 
yes it was .  my phone rang and thats what woke me up .  im so lucky to be here today .  
i am so glad that you are .  now no more driving when your sleepy . 
yeah im very thankful i didnt crash last night .  
my upstairs neighbors make a ton of noise at all hours of the night .  it makes it difficult for me to sleep .  
that really sucks .  maybe you should try egging their door? or just break in and pretend you re bigfoot while they re trying to sleep . 
i m not trying to get arrested! i think i ll just wait things out until i move in two months .

i met my wife online   years ago and can t see myself with anyone else _comma_  ever . 
you are so lucky to find someone special online .  that can turn out so badly sometimes for some people .  
oh i know .  i got lucky _comma_  we found out we lived really close to each other so we met up and it has been great ever since . 
that sounds like fate? being that both of you lived close to each other . 
my daughter has worked very hard to keep her school work finished  _comma_   her room clean  _comma_   and the dishes washed .  i bought her a cell phone for her birthday this year .  she is becoming a responsible young preteen
wow _comma_  watching kids grow up is hard .  how has she been with the cell phone?
she has been good so far .  we are trying to limit her access to it to just a few hours per day .  she also had to  turn it in  at night before she goes to bed .

yes _comma_  you do! hopefully she keeps doing the right thing with it
i am sure with your guidance she will!

that is great news! fortunately doctors are there to help us and i m glad they have helped you!
i had a septic tank issue and called a guy that i found a business card from and had him come out .  he didn t have hardly any equipment with him and sounded like he didn t know what to do . 
oh my goodness that sounds so bad! did they charge you for the visit?
no .  i just asked what it would cost to fix then told him i couldn t afford it to get him to leave .  
you made the right move .  they at least have to show up with that giant truck that sucks the tank dry . 
i bought a big bag of m&ms and i could not resist it
if i had a bag of m&m s right now i would eat them for sure!
well that is what i just did _comma_  so far i have eaten half of it
maybe save the other half for later .  lol . 
i do not think i can and feel ashamed that i cannot resist it
that s ok _comma_  it happens to us all .  tomorrow is a new day . 
i told my girlfriend about my self harm habits a little while ago .

my friends wanted to bring me to laser quest for my birthday . 
is that like a laser tag place? that sounds like a lot of fun! what do you think?
yeah exactly .  i wasn t sure if i d like it or not and i was a little unwilling to try it out .  
i ve played laser tag a few times .  i think you will have a great time! it s very high paced and noisy but that s half the fun . 
i spent all of summer doing everything but studying for my final exam
oh that sounds worrisome _comma_  do you think you will pass?
i m fairly certain i m going to fail and i feel awful about myself _comma_  but i just can t get myself to do it . 
i m sad to hear that but human nature is hard to fight .  honestly _comma_  if you have any alternative options or plans you may have to fall back on them . 
my friends and i had spent all day troubleshooting a new pc build that we had just completed . 
that sounds intensive! how did it go?
it went awful .  it turned out that the motherboard or processor were defective and we had to deconstruct it to return both pieces .  so much wasted time!
i bet that was so defeating! i m sorry to hear that .  i wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts . 
it really was .  at least my friend learned a lot about computers as we built it together!
that s a good bright side to look at . 
i found an injured spider with a leg missing in my bathroom a few days ago . 
did you save it or kill it?
i saved it .  i brought it outside and hoped for the best . 
it s missing a leg so its probably dead unfortunately . 
i passed two trials that a company put me through and i only have three left . 
ooh _comma_  i bet you can t wait to finish!
you got that right! i m feeling pretty happy about my performance and i think i ll get the job!
i hope you get it! good luck!

i found an old stamp booklet my girlfriend and i filled out before we started dating . 
that s very sweet! i bet it brought up a lot of feelings inside you . 
 definitely .  i felt so warm and fuzzy on the inside _comma_  and so did she when i sent her a snapchat of it . 
you guys sound like you have a solid relationship .  it s always great to find those little pieces from the early days . 
i m pretty sure a girl at the convention was hitting on me . 
did you get her number?
nah .  i have a loving girlfriend and i would never cheat on her . 
good man _comma_  i have a lot of respect for that . 
for my camping trip        _comma_         i brought with me my tent        _comma_         camping chairs        _comma_         mattress        _comma_         sleeping bag        _comma_         pillows        _comma_         med kit        _comma_         bug spray        _comma_         food and beer . 
that sounds like quite the checklist .  i m glad you brought the beer you might need it haha!
oh yeah definitely .  never have i ever felt so ready for anything in my life . 
well i bet you re going to have a great time .  with that haul i don t see how you couldn t!
i saw a man slap his dog on the sidewalk a few times while i was on the bus . 
holy cow! did you call him in?
i should have _comma_  but last time my girlfriend did that the police ignored it .  i was so angry . 
oh man!  do you have a dog?
i do _comma_  and i couldn t fathom how someone could do that .  i wanted to hop off the bus and yell at the guy . 
i just had to replace one of the window panes in my house . 
how come? and was it a pain to replace it?
i m not sure what happened .   i had to have a guy come out to replace it  _comma_   and couldn t meet him  _comma_   so my wife had to . 
i hope he did a good job!
my said he did!  i had quite a bit of confidence in him _comma_  based on others  feedback . 
awesome _comma_  i m glad to hear that .  sometimes it s hard to find contractors with good reputation . 
when i was a kid _comma_  all my friends had yu gi oh cards but me . 
how come you didn t collect them? i loved them myself . 
i think my parents found them expensive  _comma_   otherwise i can t think of any other good reason .  to be honest  _comma_   i kind of envied my friends . 
well _comma_  they are expensive and you didn t really miss much . 
in that case _comma_  i feel much better haha . 
i took up running and i started seeing a huge improvement in my cardiovascular endurance . 
nice _comma_  was it hard to start?
unimaginably hard .  but once i got into it i couldn t stop .  i m feeling pretty certain that i ll hit my  km goal in no time . 
wish i could run close to  km _comma_  i d struggle with     meters . 
i used to be that guy too .  if i can do it _comma_  you can do it . 
my younger brother was playing an old gamecube game that i loved to play back when i was a kid . 
that s cool .  man _comma_  those tiny disks were easy to lose .  what game?
he was playing paper mario and the thousand year door .  what an awesome game! it brought back so many great memories . 
that s awesome .  i get nostalgic about old games as well .  
my buddy drank way too much at a party and puked all over my favorite jacket . 
that sounds horrible _comma_  did you wash it or throw it away?
i washed it and it came out surprisingly .  but at that time _comma_  i felt so sick seeing what was happening to my jacket that i thought i was going to puke next . 
that is a really rough story _comma_  you should make him pay for another one . 
a few months ago _comma_  a good friend of mine that i look up to attempted suicide . 
damn _comma_  is he ok now?
thankfully he is .  he s doing much better _comma_  but the thought still shakes me scared to this day . 
did he go to the doctors for help? anyway i m glad he is ok . 
yeah he did .  he s on meds and he sees a therapist every week!
i drank too much and passed out a few months ago .  
oh no! was it a fun night? 
it was _comma_  but it got scary at some point .  apparently people were trying to wake me up by shaking me and i would not get up . 
oh heck! that had to be really scary for them! glad you re okay though! 
i was packing up my house to move _comma_  and found my old yearbooks! it s so weird to look back and see how far everyone i knew in high school has come . 
aww _comma_  that sounds interesting!  are you in touch with many people from high school?
a couple people .  fewer as the years go by _comma_  unfortunately .  
i get that .   it s weird when i forget the name of someone i knew for years . 
my brother went on a low calorie diet and began shaking everyday . 
poor thing!  is he felling better now?  i hope he quit that diet . 
he quit the diet a while ago as recommended by his doctor .  i was a little scared but i knew it was just side effects of a bad diet . 
thank god he is ok .   there are very dangerous diets around _comma_  better be guided by his doctor . 
i let my brother drive my car for the first time yesterday . 
were you nervous?
no _comma_  he s such a good driver .  i knew i had nothing to worry about . 
that s awesome .   i m glad he did so well . 
last week i woke up to a really cute text from my girlfriend and a funny message from my brother . 
that s lovely! i love waking up to awesome texts . 
yeah! i had a moment of realizing how lucky i am to be in the position i find myself in _comma_  and felt really thankful for my life and the people a part of it . 
that s so wonderful to hear . 
my girlfriend spent a few days in the woods with no cellular service with her parents . 
how did that make you feel?
really lonesome .  i missed her so much . 
i bet .  i m not great at being away from my boyfriend . 
ever since i ve been on these anti anxiety and depression medication _comma_  i ve been able to socialize a lot more . 
that s great! what have you been doing to socialize?
just talking to more people in general .  for example _comma_  at a convention i was volunteering at .  
what kind of convention?
it s called otakuthon .  it celebrates japanese culture _comma_  anime and videogames .  i was with msi and i was just so surprised with my improvement . 
i volunteer at a dog shelter every weekend . 
that s such a sweet thing to do . 
thank you _comma_  they re so cute!
dogs are probably my favorite pet .  maybe i should take up volunteering for a dog shelter one day . 
i m still upset over lil peep s death . 
lil peep died? when . 
november of      .  almost a year ago .  
damn _comma_  him and xxxtentacion we re really good . 
never really listened to xxx but peep s music really resonated with me . 
my dog sheds so much i have to vacuum my room practically every   days if i don t want little tufts of fur everywhere . 
i love puppies! but they definitely are a lot of work in terms of their hair . 
you re right .  i m just so irritated _comma_  even if it isn t his fault and i love the big goof . 
i understand .  our puppy sheds a ton too and he isnt even that hairy of a dog
my brother and a bunch of our friends planned to go to a    person cottage in july . 
oh my _comma_  that sounds like an absolute blast!
it was .  at that time _comma_  i couldn t wait for all the fun and games we would experience!
did you stay for long? that would be a great vacation .  
we stayed for only   days because it cost us about      each for four days and nights _comma_  but i hope we can book it for a whole week or two next summer . 
what a great time! is the cottage on a lake?
it s very close to a lake _comma_  it probably takes a two minute hike down through a patch of trees and tall grass to get there . 
sounds like heaven!
one time when i was in kindergarten  _comma_   i needed to go to the restroom .  the teacher did not let me  _comma_   so i peed myself
oh no! did you get in trouble?
yes _comma_  they called my parents and i was sent home .  i got spanked
aww _comma_  i m sorry .  hope that teacher learned a lesson 
last month i went on vacation and had to find someone to cat sit .  it was a relief to find someone that i could trust to come by each day and not forget . 
it s wonderful peace of mind to find someone you can trust with your fur babies! did you have a nice trip?
yes  _comma_   i was able to go visit my stepdaughter on the other side of the country .  the sitter sent pictures occasionally  _comma_   so i didn t spend my trip worrying . 
aw _comma_  that was so nice! i d love to find a cat sitter like that!
my son had his  th birthday a couple of weeks ago . 
how did it go? what d you get him for a gift?
he got a remote control excavator  _comma_   and had a lot of fun at his party .   it s crazy how fast he s growing up  _comma_   though . 
it seems like all those years just flew by _comma_  huh .  at least now he s getting old enough to start remembering all these great times!
it s really hard to get motivated on fridays . 
are you feeling zapped from the week?
yeah _comma_  there s a lot going on .   i ended up heading to work anyway . 
i m sorry to hear that .  i hope you don t have to work through the weekend!
no _comma_  i don t have to .   but there s plenty of work to do on our house!
it never ends does it? i hope you keep your head above water though _comma_  it s all you got sometimes!
i bought a bunch of dumbbells _comma_  and a workout bench but i ve barely used them . 
i feel that pain .  do you not have the motivation or just dont know what to do?
i don t have the motivation .  i know the workouts i should be doing but also struggle with proper form a bit . 
i get that .  well if i could give any advice it would be make sure you have proper form over anything .  dont worry about heavy weight if your form is garbage . 
thanks for the advice!
sure .  i love working out .  
i have a impacted wisdom tooth .  i need to go to the dentist but i am apprehensive about it . 
how much pain are you on a scale of     ?
on bad days it is about a  
dang that sounds bad! i know you might be frightened of going but i think you should go .  you ll be better off for it . 
a few years ago _comma_  i was invited to rockfest by my older brother and his friends . 
that was nice of them! i bet you felt really cool hanging with them .  how did it go?
yeah it was awesome! i was a little scared at first but within a few hours of arriving there it turned into a total blast!
that is awesome! i love festivals _comma_  they re always great to unwind and even just walk around talking to people . 
 i haven t been following my healthy eating regiment as strictly as i should . 
why not  _comma_   have you have many temptations?  i know how difficult it can be at times to eat healthy  _comma_   i struggle to do it too . 
yeah .  carbs like pasta and bread get me every time .  
i know   _comma_    fresh bread is a big temptation to me   _comma_    and what about sweets and desserts   _comma_    do you have a weakness for those too?
yup .  even though i don t need to lose any weight _comma_  i want to be healthy and cheating on this diet makes me feel bad . 
i told my best friends about my suicidal thoughts . 
it s really a good start to recognized that you should talk about it .  we all need someone to just listen once in awhile . 
yeah you re right .  i had faith in them and they ended up being really supportive . 
oh that s a good friend .  i hope your feeling better now . 
one time i thought about getting dominoes pizza _comma_  but then i remembered i was loyal to pizza hut
i like dominos better
it tastes pretty good now _comma_  but i still like the oily goodness of pizza hut!
dominoes  _comma_   imo  _comma_   has better prices and better pizza .  i dont like all that oil
one time my mom brought me lunch all the way from the restaurant where she works!
that s thoughtful of her .  nice to know that your mom was thinking of you in the middle of the day . 
yup _comma_  she is the best! i shall make it up to her one day!
take her out to dinner! that would be a treat . 
one time i was at the grocery store and i accidentally walked out with a item without paying for it
oh no! you must ve felt ashamed .  did you return it?
yes _comma_  i got caught and had to walk back in shame!
hopefully they were understanding that it was accidental?
i was very late to work today and they were so busy with patients . 
did you get wrote up or a lecture when you got their . 
well i will find out tomorrow .  i know better than that is what she told me  _comma_   especially on fridays  _comma_   when we are the busiest .  
its always best to be on time  _comma_  i hope they understand no one is perfect . 
i agree .  i feel so bad and embarrassed about it .  even the doctor scolded me .  
my boss told me to go to school to become a doctor instead of a nurse .  i felt like it was a compliment .  im worried about how much and how long medical school will take . 
the journey there is always the toughest _comma_  its years of practice and studying but in the end it will be totally worth it
i agree .  i guess i will weigh my options  _comma_   its just im getting old and watn to start a family too  _comma_   so i dont know . 
with whatever you decide in life just know that you are a very skilled and intelligent person! im sure you will find your path in life eventually with time
thank you for that! you just made my day!
my friend and i got in an argument about religion today .  it made me question my faith .  
wow _comma_   that was serious then
yeah .  i want to stay true to my beliefs _comma_  but she made some very valid points .  
ok _comma_   so what is your plan now? 
i will do research about her theories and then make really think about sticking to my beliefs .  
i remember back when i started college .  i moved to a new state where i didn t know anyone and i had no idea what to expect . 
wow that sounds scary .  did you make good friends?
yes _comma_  i did eventually .  there s something to be said for living in a dorm at a time when you want to meet new people and fit in . 
yes it can be really helpful! i went to school   hours from my home and it was still hard to meet new people
today i had to tell a patient about her lab results .  come to find out she could not have babies .  she was very upset . 
oh _comma_  that must have been a hard thing to do .  i d hate to be the one to deliver such a bad news . 
yeah i felt bad .  she started crying so much .  its like her world ended there . 
so sad . that makes me want to cry  _comma_   too  _comma_   just hearing about her reaction . 
whenever i go back to my hometown i love driving by the house i grew up in .  i have such great memories . 
i bet it does! do you go by there often?
i get to visit about once a year .  i always wish that i knew who lived there now so i could see the inside of the house . 
i bet it s much different than it was back when you lived there . 
a little _comma_  but mostly i love seeing all the things that are the same . 
i found out some bad news the other day . 
oh no :( can you tell me? it s okay if it s too private . 
i just got back my grade for my final for my class and i failed it .  i studied real hard _comma_  but unfortunately it didn t seem to matter . 
oh my gosh i m so sorry that really sucks .  :( can you talk to the professor and try to make it up or find out what you did wrong?
i m going to have to at least try .  maybe they ll be understanding and let me attempt again . 
good luck to you! i wish you all the best   
someone twisted what i said earlier today to make it seem like i was saying something else .  i felt reall ybad . 
oh no why would they do such a thing
they were angry and wanted to be aggressive .  
definitely doesn t excuse what they did . 
some lady i know tried to hit on me even though she very well knew i am in a relationship!
that s not cool .  i bet it felt awkward . 
it really did but i would never do something to jeopardize my relationship . 
you are a stand up person!
i had a nice quiet evening at home tonight . 
nice _comma_  silence is golden
well   _comma_    my family was here   _comma_    too .   toddlers don t make life quiet   _comma_    but they make me feel fulfilled . 
full of what?
full of meaning . 
there was a meeting scheduled today that i thought was utterly pointless . 
oh no _comma_  was it one of those meetings that should have been an email?
it definitely was _comma_  so i ended up skipping it . 
hopefully you don t get in trouble but i definitely know the feeling .  
i regretted skipping the meeting a little bit _comma_  but probably not as much as if i d gone to it . 
i told my close friend a very big secret yesterday . 
oh really _comma_  were you supposed to tell them?
it was my choice .  i really don t think they ll tell anyone! they re good people . 
you can never be to sure now a days _comma_  they might post your secret to social media . 
one time i was really sure that i was going to ace a test because i studied all night
did you ace your test?
yup  _comma_   i was worried during the test too  _comma_   but i am glad everything turned out okay
i always worry when i have to take tests .  unfortunately _comma_  i am horrible with tests .  i am glad you aced it!
a friend at work recently got a raise .   that s the  nd one in the last year for him!
nice _comma_  what a legend and a gentleman
yeah _comma_  but i haven t had one in   years . 
word _comma_  you should ask him what the secret is
i was totally committed to him in every way i could be .    however he ended up cheating on me
that kind of cold disregard for someone you re supposed to love is totally alien to me _comma_  the guilt would destroy me . 
it would me too _comma_  not only that but he just up and got with her like i never existed to him .    its funny because he always accused me of cheating on him and i had no clue why .   it was him the whole time!
yeah freud called it projection _comma_  it s too bad people tend to hide their true natures so well . 
he kept doing drugs _comma_  and taking things that didnt belong to him .   it broke my heart but i didnt know what else to do . 
it s awful! i know so many families are dealing with similar situation .  sometimes we don t know how to help someone close to us .  heart breaking . 
yes you are right about that .   i dealt with it for a long time and then i just couldn t anymore .   over and over things would disappear and he would of course always deny it .   he became violent at time to his sister and me and i couldn t put them at risk . 
you can t help him until he wants to really change .  sometimes all you can do is pray . 
today after coming back from work i saw my wife and she was asking me why are you late with questioning eyes  _comma_   i told her that i wen t to go and get her favourite meal  _comma_   i felt so faithful 
did she feel bad and apologize after she realized what you had done?
she was joking about it  _comma_   but she was so happy afterwards and we ate together  _comma_   it was such a nice day
it s good to get to spend time with those you love .  i am happy for you . 
after a long day from work     _comma_      i was stuck at this math problem     _comma_      but then i decided to go for a walk instead of working on the problem     _comma_      i trust my guts     _comma_      after i had come back from the walk     _comma_      the solution kicked in and i was able to do the problem
that s inspiring _comma_  has that worked for you in the past in the same way?
yes always _comma_  it is something that works for me
that s so cool _comma_  you seem very intuitive
it was  am  _comma_   i was walking at the utter night .  i was scared out of my mind .  anything could happen  _comma_   my walking speed increased .  and everything i was seeing suddenly became more and more scary
that sounds frightening .  did you get home safely?
in the end yes .  but the journey was sure hell
why were you walking so late at night?
today i realised the small details of my life and i feel more satisfied
nice _comma_  what are some things you realized?
that i have everything i wished for . 
you don t have me yet   
one time i bought water and snacks before a hurricane came to wreck my city
oh god _comma_  how did you  .  have the courage to even go outside?
my house flooded so i had to get on my roof !
that sounds like an adventurous day 
one time they put cheese in my hamburger when i told them not to!
wow _comma_  how could they do that?
they are complete monsters i tell ya!
someone s gotta put an end to that poor service!
i lied to my mother and i feel very uneasy
you should .  no matter what you can t lie to your mom .  it will always come back on you . 
i just realised this now
come clean and fix it .  it will make you feel better . 
i am beginning to realise in my abilities and i feel so confident in them _comma_  i am able to anything
nice! do you have any superpowers?
in a way yes _comma_ yes i do the power of my will and mind
i like your confidence! fighting!
when i drink coffee _comma_  memories from my past keep playing in my head
oh nice _comma_  what kind of memories?
memories of talking to strangers in chatroom .  lots of things 
how does this make you feel like?
i have been working on my programming skills and i feel like i can get a new job now!
that s awesome! you re going to be rolling in the dough with those skills
hell yeah _comma_  no more living in mom s basement!
that s exciting .  how long have you been learning programming?
from time to time i see an older man around our town driving his lawn mower from place to place .   sometimes i see him at  mcdonalds _comma_ or the dollar general store .   
an interesting one _comma_  what does this make you feel ?
well at first i thought it was cute until i saw him at the gas station the other day .   i overheard him asking someone that was getting gas if he happened to have a little change he could have .   he needed to get home in his lawnmower but didn t have the money to do so .    i ended up giving him   bucks . 
oh did he say anything afterwards? what happend next?
i believe i am a really caring person _comma_  because i always take care of cats and feed them and lately they are more and more close to me
that is so kind of you  _comma_   i also a have a soft heart for animals .   i happen to be a dog person  _comma_   but i do have a cat that was my ex boyfriends .   
i am a both person ahaha i also have a dog _comma_  but he is always so mean 
i can t say i have had any mean dogs as of yet .   my favorite breed is  a pitbull .    they are so loyal  and sweet although  lots of people claim they are mean and vicious  . 
towels  _comma_   clothes  _comma_   underwear and phone all checked! and ready for my holiday  feelingsoprepeared
where are you going!
to see my baby girl
thats awesome i hope you have a good time with her
one time i bought a scratch lottery ticket and i didn t win anything!
wow _comma_  that must ve been disappointing . 
yes _comma_  i was off by one number .  i was going to be a millionaire!
oh! so close .  just to think about that missed opportunity . 
every day the weather makes me feel so nostalgic  _comma_   the colors  _comma_   the wind all bring back a certain memory from my past
yeah _comma_  it s like time passes but the smells and everything stays the same
yes! i am so glad you get it _comma_  it s beautiful but also sad at the same time
yup _comma_  and i feel there s a part of us that is eternal as well
one time i went into the public restroom and saw poop smeared everywhere! ew!
i think i would leave if i saw something like that . 
i left as fast as possible!
did you tell someone about it so they could take care of it?
nope _comma_  just you!
it seems most responsible to alert someone to clean it . 
one time i was so nervous to look at my grade for my final exam
i feel that way sometimes when i check my bank account _comma_  how s school going?
i failed and dropped out! now i live in my parents house doing nothing all day
word  _comma_   college is tough  _comma_   wishing you the best
like who on earth writes var int value       _comma_    this is so ridiculous i am so annoyed at my brother   _comma_    after everything i tought him   _comma_    he doesn t even know the basics 
 and got upset with you?
no i was the one who was upset with him
 and why do not you try to teach your brother?
programming!
i am working so hard _comma_  that i can see a pile of money building up for my future 
good for you!  i hope it does not stress you out _comma_  though . 
it doesn t i am taking regular breaks
that is good .   money is no good if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it . 
one time i saw a creepy person run towards me in the night out in the streets
dang _comma_  how fast did you run away?
i froze up because i was terrified .  it was just my brother though
did you tell him how creepy he is lol
while i was packing my stuff to move _comma_  i found old high school pictures .  it made me think of all the good times  i had . 
that is awesome _comma_  what types of photos did you find? anything funny or silly? 
well more of my old best friend .  i have not seen her i a long time . we went through alot together .  it was nostalgic to me .  
aww yeah _comma_  those are great times that you can never really go back to .  sometimes i also wish i could go back in time . maybe you could call her up again and catch up on the last few years! 
i agree! we have alot of things to catch up on .  
being alive is so much stress and anxiety  _comma_   why does it have to be like this? why can t we just all express our individual selves  _comma_   instead we are forced to work so that we can eat 
it s not fair _comma_  eh .  having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself .  at least it s comforting know that most everyone feels the same? 
yes       _comma_        it s true we all know this inside out       _comma_        but we still continue to work on our meaningless lives       _comma_        the funny thing is we all know but no one is acting       _comma_        if we all acted we would be living in a much more beautiful and free life       _comma_        not one which just gives the impression of freedom       _comma_        that s all there is now       _comma_        faking but i guess the one thing that is true is my feelings
maybe if we weren t so attached to being creatures of comfort .  some things we just can t let go of  _comma_   wouldn t exist without some poor shmuck having to do the dirty work .  i guess we re all that shmuck to someone  _comma_   someway or another . 
i watched a movie the other night that really got me in my feelings . 
oh wow _comma_  what ovie was it and how did it make you feel? 
i don t remember the name .  i was watching it with a friend and they put it on but it was about a son who found his birth mother after many years apart . 
oh wow that sounds very emotional _comma_  i think i would have needed a bucket to catch all my tears .  
i am so disappointed in myself  _comma_   i could have do so much better at work but i guess it wasn t my day  _comma_   i was not able to focus
i liked my friend very much and believed that he can not talk negatively about me
what makes you so sure? anything can happen i mean just look at murphy s law 
may be you are right .  but sometimes _comma_  you go with your heart not with the law .  murphy s law may not work in every situation . 
my grandma ended up getting really sick this last week . 
oh no _comma_  i am sorry to hear that .  how is she doing and how are you holding up? 
she is getting much better .  my family and i did everything we could to take care of her . 
that is great that she has such a great support group and loving family members to support her .  i hope she gets well soon! :)
i feel so guilty  _comma_   my sister crying because  someone eat her cake  that she had been saving for   days now  _comma_   and that someone was non other than me . 
oh no _comma_  maybe buy her a new cake to make it up to her!
oh wow you are such a genius! why didn t i think of that before .  there is always a bright side to everything
yes there is! maybe throw in a cupcake too _comma_  i am sure she will forgive you in a heart beat! i know i would .  :) 
words cannot describe how happy i am _comma_  in   weeks time i will go and see my wife i am so joyful and exciting 
i am so happy for you! why have you been apart for the past two weeks?
no we live in a long distance relationship (not for long though) so it s hard for me to see her _comma_  but i will be able to see her after   months apart  
awesome to hear that you ll get to live with your loved one soon
i had a terrible experience at the grocery store today . 
oh no what happened _comma_  are you alright? 
yeah _comma_  i m alright .  but i dropped a jar of pasta sauce and it ended up shattering .  sauce got all over the floor . 
oh no that must have been a terrible experience _comma_  i hope no one got hurt from the shattered glass . 
i aced all my classes this semester _comma_  so im hoping and thinking my gpa will be a   .  
that s what i like to hear! what changes did you make this semester to achieve your possible   .  ?
i actually gave more effort this semester _comma_  so i will continue to do goo and hope to get into nursing school next year . 
wow .  that s awesome! you ll need  that work ethic in nursing school for sure . 
i agree .  im planning and hopping things go well . 
so everything for a party im throwing this weekend is ready and everything is paid for .  i have it ready last week so i wouldnt stress . 
it sounds like you re quite the organized person!
yea .  i like to have things ready and done prior to make sure everything goes well . 
i m the same way a lot of the time .  it s really a good way to avoid any unnecessary disasters . 
im going to ask my girlfriend to marry me this weekend! i have no doubt in my mind she will say no
that is so exciting! best of luck to you man! i doubt she would reject such a great guy like you .  :) 
thanks! i think we are doing well so i wont be disappointed or sidetracked by a no from her . 
that is great _comma_  i would also be surprised if she said no to a man like you! 
i am so afraid .  afraid that i am not giving too much to the world _comma_  what if i parish not having done anything?
i wouldn t worry too much about it .  none of it really matters  _comma_   if we make a difference or not  _comma_   we all end up dust in the end . 
no   _comma_    i don t believe that   _comma_    whether you are having a bad day or not if you look at everything clearly you will see there is a next stage   _comma_    just like birth death is a process
if telling yourself that makes you feel better _comma_  i found all of that to be much more stressful .  to be completely honest with you i think people invented stories about the after life to make them more comfortable with death . 
not necessarily          _comma_            while it s true you have your traditional christian or muslim that preach the afterlife as some miracle and hell          _comma_           scaring people into not being themselves          _comma_           but death isn t a scary phase          _comma_           and i don t care about whether i am going to die          _comma_           as that is just the ego trying to cling on and survive          _comma_           i ve passed that point          _comma_           but after looking clearly you ll see there is more than just this dimension and that is just a simple fact          _comma_           science tells us this too          _comma_           it s not about feeling good or feeling comfortable with death          _comma_           it s about growing 
the world is such a disgusting place now _comma_  i wish i was born back in the   s 
yeah   _comma_      s were incredible   _comma_    the dancing the cars   _comma_    the women had style and the music was incredible . 
right?! but now is just so bad _comma_  i wish i could go back
but we got to make the best of it _comma_  pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again . 
today everyone said congratulations to me  _comma_   as i succeed in making an amazing app  _comma_   and now i am so greatful to be alive! 
congratulations on your success! i bet you worked incredible hard to achieve your goals . 
thank you! it s always nice to tell you these things  _comma_   you don t get jealous and you are just happy for me  _comma_   thank you
there will always be people that are jealous of your success _comma_  but it is up to you to be the bigger person and handle it with grace . 
i came home from work today to a disaster .  my dog chewed up the new couch i just purchased . 
oh no _comma_  can you return it or get a refund?
no i didnt purchase insurance .  when i saw it my blood was boiling!
i am sorry to hear that _comma_  i would have felt the same way .  
yeah .  im so upset i cant even think right nowl
i gave my dog away to a family today .  i did not have time for him since work and school take alot of it up . 
that has got to be rough .  at least it has a home now that hopefully has more time . 
i agree _comma_  but im praying they will take care of him .  hes just a puppy . 
i m sure they will be great to him and he ll bring them joy as well!
yeah thats all i can ask for . 
i saw my girlfriend getting real friendly with another guy at the bar last night
oh no! are you the jealous type?
it definitely had me feeling a little uneasy about the whole situation . 
oh man! yeah i would of felt the same way!
i have a test coming up next week . 
oh no do you feel ready for it? 
i m super ready for it! i spent so much time studying over the last week . 
that is great _comma_  i believe that you will do amazing! 
i am so annoyed! i have been trying to solve this math problem for   hours now
oh that sounds really annoying .  maybe you can look it up online or get someone to help?
there isn t any solution it s a century award i am working on _comma_  it s the problem of non polynomial descent 
oh i see  _comma_   well good luck to you  _comma_   i hope you ll solve it soon . 
i m really feeling alright about how my life is going right now . 
that is great _comma_  what has been going on in your life recently?
i ve just been getting things done .  nothing has been going amazing but nothing really sucks either . 
that is good  _comma_   sometimes that is all you really need to do  _comma_   get things done  one step at a time :) 
the ads for the new world of warcraft expansion really makes me think about when i played it many years ago . 
they looked really exciting! does it make you want to play it again?
it does .  i put so much time in that game before .  i might have to pick it up again . 
if it makes you happy then you should do it! capitalize on that nostalgic feeling while you can . 
i woke up to something super annoying this morning . 
that is always frustrating .  what happened?
i woke up to find out my car was sideswiped while it was parked by the curb during the night .  no note or anything . 
wow _comma_  some people are just terrible! i hate when people don t take responsibility for their actions . 
i m really disappointed in my son s actions that i was told about . 
what did he do?
he got caught cheating by his teacher on a test the other day . 
oh no .  what do you think caused him to do that?
probably because he did not study enough so was unprepared . 
i ate such a disgusting thing the other day by accident . 
what was it that you accidentally ate?
i bought a sandwich and after a few bite i noticed that there was a bunch of mold . 
eww that sounds horrible! were you able to get a refund at least?
i was!
i recently had my first child .   i was absolutely terrified when i went into labour but i put all my faith in the wonderful midwives and everything worked out perfectly!
i m glad it went as planned .  i can imagine that to be a very stressful moment . 
it really was its just so scary but i had to believe the experience and caring nature of the midwives would get my through it and it did .   i really admire anyone in that career _comma_  its not just a job but a vocation . 
you ve really got to be committed to go into work like that .  it s not for everybody _comma_  i agree . 
indeed .   the really do work with life and death everyday . 
i started a diet today and just as soon as i get home i eat a burger!
i know how hard diets are to stick to .  what foods are you avoiding?
fried foods .  i feel bad i didn t commit to it the first day .  
don t be too hard on yourself  _comma_   it s hard to quit something immediately .  just keep trying  _comma_   i believe in you!
thank you! i need that motivation so i can get over this shame im feeling .  
i get it .  there is always another meal to start making the change!
i m so not looking forward to tomorrow . 
why not? what happens tomorrow?
i have to talk to a large group at work tomorrow .  
don t let it worry you too much .  just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly! you can do it!
i changed my shift to overnight and walking to my care gave me the creeps tonight .  there was a man standing in the dark . 
that sounds creepy! is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car? there is strength in numbers!
i agree .  i had goosbumps all over and chills down my spine .  
i definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife .  stay safe out there!
my brother is going into surgery tomorrow . 
i hope that all goes well .  i am sure he will be good as new after!
i m really hoping so! i ve been really worried . 
i am sure the procedure will go excellently . 
today my friend had all of is awe _comma_  becasue she won the singing contest at work .  she is so shy and no one would have ever known she could sing .  
that s really cool! i bet people really underestimated that underdog!
i agree! i was amazed with her performance .  she did really well . 
that s awesome! maybe she ll come out of her shell . 
i hope so .  she is very talented .  who would have known .  
i have such a fear of flying _comma_  so you can just imagine how i felt when my husband bought us a sky diving voucher for my   th birthday! he was so excited and i was so nervous and uneasy . 
he s a brave man .  how was the experience?
well the day came and off we travelled .   we arrived at the place only to find all our friends and family there to cheer us on .   up we went in the plane and of course while the lovely instructors tried to reassure me the whole time  _comma_   i tried desperately to keep my breakfast down!  however after the nerves and initial panic when we jumped out  _comma_   it was actually one of the most amazing experiences of my life!
it sounds incredible! hopefully it helped you conquer your fear!
it certainly did .   i would definitely recommend it .   my husband though is another story .   he has a fear of the sea and underwater so you can just guess what i will be buying him for his next big birthday haha . 
i was so worried that i could not pay for my tuition this semester .  thankfully my boss decided to give us a big bonus .  
congratulations! worrying about tuition is the absolute worst panic!
yeah and its the last one before i graduate! i can be more thankful for his generosity .  
you re going to kill it this semester! you re going to be so proud when you re walking down the aisle to get handed your degree . 
thanks for the kind words .  i cant be more happy and excited to be done!
i was doing a big clear out recently and stumbled accross my old high school year book .   it is a long time since i left school and couldnt believe i even still had it .   such a feeling of nostalgia looking at the old photos and reading the stories . 
did you guys write still write notes in each others  books in high school?
yes!  i laughed and sometimes cried a bit reading through those _comma_  especially from some old friends that are no longer with here .   it even brought up some great memories of prom and our school leaving party . 
it s amazing how many feelings and memories mementos like that can bring back . 
indeed .   it definitely made my clear out day much more enjoyable . 
so i just bought a brand new corvette and i let my friend barrow it to go out of town .  
that s awesome! hopefully it comes back in one piece . 
i agree! she will take care of it .  i have faith she will bring it back the way she got it! lol
i think it will be fine .  i bet the new car runs well . 
yeah it does .  i never let anybody drive my car _comma_  but i felt i could let her since she is responsible .  
my husband wont be back for a month due to work and im here at the house by myself . 
im sure that is tough .   you must really miss him . 
yeah i have no pets or children so im just here in an empty house .  
do you get nervous being on your own?
nah just bored .  im new to this city so i dont know anybody either .  
oh that sounds even tougher .   it is a long time but i hope it flies by for you and your hubby is back home again . 
yea i agree! ii feel so helpless being home by myself .  
im sure your not though! 
i had the worst experience last weekend .   i woke up to find someone had stolen my car! i was in absolute shock just couldnt believe it . 
thats horrible! did you get the police involved?
well yes .   while i was in my daze  _comma_   absolutely horrified  _comma_   my level headed husband did all the practical things like contact the police and insurance company etc . 
yeah i would have felt the same way .  
thankfully the insurance company sorted my out with a courtesy car for now but still cant believe there are people out there that do such terrible things!
yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this . 
true but in time i finally did see that its not the end of the world _comma_  its just a car that can be replaced but that initial overwhelming feeling was awful . 
today after a long day at work i sat in traffic for   hours due to construction on the freeway!
that s a ton of traffic .  i hope they finish their project soon
me too! i get so frusterated because there are no back roads to my house so i have to go through this for the next   weeks .  
that s unfortunate .  i wish we could fly sometimes . 
me too _comma_  so i wouldn t have to deal with wasted time!
my old friend suprised me with a phone call today .  i have not heard from her since high school .  
how lovely!  i such it was so nostalgic to talk about old times together . 
yes it was .  i cant wait for our reunion so we can catch up on more!
that is a brilliant idea .   there is nothing better than catching up with old friends . 
yes the things we remember and ponder about are the greatest!
a little stray pup appeared on my driveway yesterday .   my initial reaction was to contact the local pet shelter .   however no one had reported him .   i decided to take him in _comma_  wash him and feed him .   i have never been much of an animal person but i couldnt believe how much i felt for this poor wee puppy . 
awe your such a caring and loving person! are you going to keep it?
i didnt think i was but he has won my heart .   no one claimed him  _comma_   even after posters being put around so yes he has officially become part of the family .   to be honest i was glad no owner came forward  _comma_   i would never have wanted to give him up in the end he has just stolen my heart!
the love and care you show him will bring him joy and happiness! 
just as he does to us . 
i got super wasted .  i accidentally messed myself in front of people
oh wow _comma_  that must ve been a hard situation .  especially later when you were more in control again . 
yeah .  that was the day i decided to no longer drink
that sounds like a good decision .  good luck!
i m really excited for this next weekend!
what s happening this weekend? i hope you have some good things planned . 
a friend that has been living overseas for the last year or so is going to come back to visit finally!
that s awesome! i m very excited for you this is a good event for you!
i had a really scary experience the other day . 
that s interesting .  are you okay?
yeah _comma_  i m fine .  my friend got into a car crash while i was in the car though . 
that s bad news .  i hope that everyone is healthy and doing well . 
i went camping the other day and had a rlly bad experience during it . 
why what happened?
i ended up getting lost for a bit in the woods which was not fun .  luckily _comma_  i made it back to my group at some point . 
oh sounds scary!  i would have been scared . 
when i was a teenager i used to borrow my big sisters clothes without her knowledge .   one time she had just bought a lovely new dress after saving all her wages .   that weekend i borrowed it and of course ripped it!  the next day when she found out she was so angry and i felt terrible . 
oh no! i hope she s forgiven you since then . 
oh yes she has _comma_  it was a while ago now but at the time the guilt was awful .   needless to say i learnt my lesson and never borrowed her clothes again!
that s probably a good idea . 
yes just a pity i had to learn the hard way . 
my last day of work was yesterday .  i got so emotional driving home and i cried . 
i m sorry to hear you were upset! why did you have to quit?
im going back to school full time .  i was there for more than    years .  i will miss everyone .  
wow that is a long time! hopefully you can stay in touch with all of your former coworkers . 
yeah just thinking about it makes me want to tear up .  
yesterday i found my boyfriend with someone else!
hmmn _comma_  really? . i guess you must have felt very bad
i was gonna explode .  im so fed up with him .  im so done . 
am so sorry about that _comma_  did he apologize?
he doesnt know i know _comma_  but he will soon when i throw his stuff out
one time when i was younger i wore a halloween costume that i d been looking forward to show off .   but i ended up covering myself up with a cape _comma_  because i was self conscious of how i looked . 
aww  i m sorry that happened .  why were you embarrassed?
well the costume itself ended up looking great  _comma_   since my mom made it .   but i hadn t realized how fat i looked when i wore it  _comma_   so i felt bad . 
it s always difficult when you feel self conscious   but i ve learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself .  
that s true _comma_  but no matter how much i tell myself that i always end up thinking about it too much about it .   i m constantly worrying about what people think of me . 
please try to be kinder to yourself! you are a great person  with a lot to offer .  always remember to be good to yourself . 
whom do you belive the most
in reference to what?
your trustful person?
my husband is my most trusted companion . 
oh _comma_  how much did you like him
my father couldn t stope any lower _comma_  how can someone take money from their own child
that s horrible! i m a parent and i could never take money from my child .  did you confront him?
i did many times _comma_  but he threatens to kick me out and ruin everything
how frustrating! keep your head held high and be strong .  one day you ll be able to keep him from taking your money . 
my wife is always there for me  _comma_   so i trust her more than anybody and i dont want to have any friends otehr than her  _comma_   she is my faith
that s really nice   _comma_    however   _comma_    to keep the marriage fresh and strong   _comma_    i think it s important for you to have outside friends . 
that s only normie talk _comma_  we are both introverted and we hate people
haha  _comma_   well i do know the feeling .  i guess if it works for you  _comma_   then don t change anything . 
i am a joke _comma_  i am ashemed of what i did
what did you do???
i builied someone because they made fun of my mother _comma_  but the person had difficulties walking already and i buillied i can t believe i did that
well im sure you ll get over it .  nobody should make fun of our mothers
i  waited   years for them to realise season   and they promised it was to be released today _comma_  i was so devastated when i found out that they had to postpone it even more :  it s just so annoying
stay hopeful!  _comma_  they ll release it sooner or later
i hope so : 
it s all gonna be fine and you ll get what u want . 
i still have a favorite stuffed animal of mine that i ve had since i was young .   it s still in pretty good condition and reminds me a lot of my childhood . 
that is so sweet .  it is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories .  
yeah _comma_  it is .   i always like to keep things that mean a lot to me and this was a gift from my mom so it s even more special . 
that really does make it special .  i m glad you have that .  
a young girl   _comma_    crying   _comma_    sadden by the cruelity of our elders   _comma_    told me about all these feelings i began to cry and became very sentimental
 . what feelings? what are you talking about
she said that the elder man approached her and told her she is dumb and that made her very sad and upset
oh man _comma_  that s rough to hear from someone older than you .  is she ok?
i am so envious of my sister _comma_  she has everything i just want to make her life hell
that doesn t sound very good _comma_  but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with
yeah but only i should get everything! no one else
other people deserve to have things _comma_  too . 
i am so embaressed at myself .  i cant believe i fell down the stairs and my pants fell and my behind was exposed to the whole crowd 
oh no! when that happens you have to get up and yell _comma_   safe! 
indeed _comma_  but this time i was red and yelling in my head
awww _comma_  well it happens to everyone sometimes .  just try to forget it .  
don t you think life is peaceful? are you content?
eh not really .  what about you
i did   _comma_    espcially today when i woke up   _comma_    i realised how everything is meaningful and how i can t just waste my life chasing after money and stupid things like that   _comma_    so i decided to work hard on becoming free
and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?
i will work on the things i enjoy _comma_  which is knowledge and learning more and go for nature walks more often
i love walking in nature .  hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors
i ve known my best friend since i was   years old .   he joined the air force after high school and moved out of state and i was really upset when he left . 
oh it s always sad when someone you care about leaves .  can you at least keep in contact with him?
oh yeah _comma_  we still keep in contact over the internet daily and visit each other every few years .   but i miss when we used to hang out every day . 
i know .  it is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least .  
the future is so uncertain and yet so certain i am so not ready for what s about to come it fills mee with anxiety and depression just thinking about it
everything is going to be okay .  try to relax .  
i hope so
if there is something in particular _comma_  try to deal with it head on .  
i have been spending a year learning a new skill and after so much study and hard work it is finally paying off .  i am feeling faithful again .  
that is great .  may i know what you have learnt
i have been learning to trade on the forex markets . 
it is challenging i guess .  best wishes that you developed skill over it
thank you sir _comma_  have a great day!
great day to you too
i am so prepared the exam tomorrow!
how hard have you been studying? exams are extreme amounts of mental crunch time!
yup but i have been studying since for a year 
you sound very confident! i wish i had your confidence when i was in school . 
tomorrow i have interview and i have done my study so i am feeling confident
i bet you will do great! what job is the interview for?
art design
that s a great field .  my daughter just got a degree in art but she hasn t been able to find a job yet .  good luck tomorrow!
thank you! i have a freelaning job at art already but i just want the qualifcation for more _comma_  maybe your daughter can do the same thing
i did so well in that biology exam haha _comma_  i anticipated those questions to come up i was so ready
good for you .  being prepared is always better than the alternative . 
yup! defiently _comma_  i am so amazing 
don t get too cocky but enjoy your victory you deserve it . 
i am so mad at myself  _comma_   i woke up late again today and missed a very important deadline  _comma_   even though i set   alarms
oh no! you must feel really bad .  are you able to fix the problem?
no _comma_  i can t i just need to fix myself as  i am the problem
please try not to be so hard on yourself! we all make mistakes . 
i really hate going to the doctor .  i was hesitant about going this time . 
why do you need to go to the doctor?
i had a painful cyst and i knew i would have to get a needle . 
oh that s terrible .  did they take care of it?
i was planning on going to grad school and i told a lot of people .  i ended up not going _comma_  and i felt embarrassed every time someone asked me about how school was going . 
that sounds very uncomfortable .  were you honest with them about your change of plans?
yes .  without really giving details _comma_  i always kind of shrugged off their questions and told them that it didn t work out . 
right .  
i found a picture of my daughter and me from when i took her to a waterfall a long time ago .  it brought tears to my eyes . 
oh i bet that was amazing! i have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when i was young and it s a nice thing to think back on .  does your daughter remember it?
yes she does .  of course she doesn t see the sentimentality of it yet as i do .  she is only    .  
one day she ll look back and it will mean so much to her! memories with parents are the best ones . 
i have the worst fear of carnival rides _comma_  i always think they
i totally understand  _comma_   i hate carnival rides too  _comma_   they always feel so rickety .  do you have a particular one you fear the most?
(pressed enter too early) .  i love thrill rides  _comma_   but i don t trust any carnival ride that gets rebuilt every time the fair opens up  _comma_   too many horror stories .  i mostly hate the ones that spin you a million different directions . 
agreed  _comma_   a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards  _comma_   but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me . 
my wife s cousin was sent to the hospital and was placed in a medically induced coma with something having to do with his lungs
oh my goodness! that sounds awful! was this recently?
yes .  they aren t sure what s wrong but his oxygen level is down to   %
i m so sorry to hear that .  hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on .  are y all able to visit him?
i was on the highway during a strong thunderstorm _comma_  no visibility .  i had a bad feeling someone bad was going to happen and no more than    minutes later two cars in front of me crash and one gets flipped over . 
that s so scary!  you must have strong intuition
yeah i honestly don t but the whole mood on that highway just felt right for that to happen .  a lot of people weaving and having their hazards on for no reason . 
i m so glad you came out of it okay .   i hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse . 
walking to a restaurant the other day and i forgot to hold the door open for an old lady _comma_  felt so bad about it because she was right next to the door too . 
it was nice of you to at least think of it .  i m sure she wasn t that upset . 
i hope so _comma_  i usually hold it open for everybody but i was distracted and didn t see her . 
it s totally understandable .  life can get really busy sometimes!
i bought a new phone recently and not long after i dropped it and shattered the screen _comma_  first time this happens and it was just terrible . 
oh _comma_  that s not good .  did you get a warranty for the phone?
no i usually don t since i ve never dropped mines but i do get warranty now .  it wasn t a cheap repair either . 
i m sorry to hear that .  i hope that everything works out for you . 
i was disgusted when my dog tried to attack another dog
did the other dog provoke him? i wouldn t stress it too much  _comma_   its just natural behavior for them  _comma_   take him to training school . 
not really _comma_  but he knows better .  i think i will get a trainer . 
oh then yeah _comma_  invest in a trainer .  i love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous . 
saw an old cassette of my cousins fifteens and saw my mother before she passed away _comma_  felt nice seeing her on video again . 
oh i m so sorry but i bet that was very special of you to find . 
yeah sadly we don t have many videos of her but the few we have we keep them safe and stored . 
i would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens . 
i got the scores for my final exam .  got a b and passed the class _comma_  it was a good day to celebrate . 
that s awesome!  congratulations!
yeah _comma_  i pampered myself and went with some friends to a japanese sushi place . 
nice choice!  getting a b is definitely something to celebrate
ordered a new pair of headphones online .  they are a really high end pair so i m very excited to finally get them . 
that s exciting!  there s nothing like listening to your favorite music with great headphones
yeah _comma_  it really is a day and night difference .  let s you appreciate the intricacies of a song much better . 
i agree    % .   sounds like it s time to start downloading some new tunes to test out!
my wife is having a hard time after finding out we can no longer have children .  i am doing my best to support her and care for her but it is very hard when nothing seems to work . 
oh thats heartbreaking _comma_  do you guys already have children?
i do but she doesn t .  which makes it harder i think .  all i can do is be there for her and hope time helps her heal . 
i really hope she gets better too _comma_  it must be terrible to know you cant have any kids .  you re a good man for helping her cope . 
back in middle school i had a crush on a girl and one day in class she was talking to another guy .  i was jealous for a while but it didn t matter anyways .  i ended up getting her . 
young love _comma_  it s such a bittersweet quest . 
it is _comma_  those were the funnest days .  no responsibilities . 
i know right? i wish i was young again sometimes . 
i had a lot of feelings when i found pictures of my dog who has passed . 
it s always difficult losing a pet .   i m sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than they re gone
it was very bittersweet .  she could not work her legs anymore due to age . 
you just have to remember what a good life she had with you!
i moved to my current town one year ago and i really like it here .  i m happy and couldn t think of a better place to live . 
nice! why do you like it more than other places you ve lived?
it s my first time living in a small town .  i love the fresh air .  i have also met some great people . 
that s good! i ve always heard that people are closer friends to each other in a small town . 
either that _comma_  or people are just nosier and love getting into each other s business! just kidding .  i think the slower pace of life just makes people nicer . 
i very much could count on my mom to always be there for me . 
that s a blessing .   i know a lot of people didn t have a mom like that . 
me too .  i am so thankful for her . 
is there anything she does specifically for her?
i was upset when i failed my math test
i m sorry .  i know how that feels .  did you study really hard?
i did _comma_  but the material was a hard subject . 
oh _comma_  okay .  maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy .  i hope you do better next time . 
i m glad i can trust my husband to always be there for me . 
that s sweet! i have a great husband too! how long have you been married?
just under two years .  still feel like a  
that s great! we ve been married for almost    years and i still feel like a newlywed .  it s great when you marry your best friend . 
hi friend! wow _comma_  i was so scared of this taxi driver when i was vacationing in mexico .  he looked rather suspicious . 
oh gosh! that sounds frightening! did you get out the taxi as soon as you could?
no _comma_  i just trusted him .  but i wrote all his details in my phone just in case .  
oh _comma_  well that was a smart thing to do .  i would ve bailed .  lol
yeah but the car was on the highway and i could not get out .  thankfully everything was alright .  never again though!
i was storing all of my old photos on my new external hard drive yesterday .  it made me wish i could go back and time and see some relatives again . 
i usually love the trips down memory lane _comma_  but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around .  i m sorry . 
it s bittersweet! nice to see their faces again _comma_  but sad to miss them . 
i m right there with you .  it makes you shed a tear sometimes too . 
i lied to my friend about something and told her something was okay when it really wasn t
oh .  i know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations .  hopefully you did this to protect someone s feelings
i just felt really bad and guilty that i did it . 
yeah   _comma_    i think that means you have a conscience   _comma_    which is a good thing .  if you didn t feel bad   _comma_    i d worry about you!
sometimes a fly gets in my apartment and i hold my cat over my head and we chase it .  she hasn t scratched or bitten me once while we do this!
that would make a funny video! we have a super friendly _comma_  playful cat too . 
i love cats .  they re so funny and such good company!
yes _comma_  they are .  he is my daughter s best friend .  she can do whatever she wants and he is unphased . 
i babysat my nephew overnight last weekend .  he was scared so i let him sleep in bed with me _comma_  even though he kicks a lot . 
that was thoughtful _comma_  sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone .  hope you didn t get kicked too much!
haha i didn t sleep a wink .  he s only   .  he pretends to be all cool _comma_  but he s still very much a little kid . 
kids are interesting creatures that s for sure .  i m sure you got some cool uncle points . 
i m an auntie :p
my mistake :)
my pet dog is always there for me .  no matter what _comma_  i can count on her . 
i feel the same way about my dog .   they re the greatest!
yes they are they are always happy to see you and they will always there for you
i don t know what i would do without my dog .   i m glad you have one that s always there for you!
i had a great breakfast this morning .  it was delicious and i felt very happy and relaxed . 
nice! what did you have? i am planning to serve breakfast for dinner tonight . 
eggs    _comma_     bacon    _comma_     strawberries    _comma_     tomatoes    _comma_     and coffee .  so yummy!
mmmm .  that sounds really good! i m thinking biscuit and sausage gravy _comma_  hash brown and eggs . 
i called someone by the wrong name earlier today .  i didn t really know them and hadn t seen them in ages . 
i hate when that happens .  i bet you meant well but you re left looking like a crazy person! i hope they understood . 
they were ok with it _comma_  but i hope i didn t hurt their feelings . 
i think they will get over it .  most people understood that not everyone is going to remember every little thing . 
the other day we were in the front yard _comma_  and you won t believe what happened!
what happened? the yard always has mysteries!
my   year old just dropped his pants and started peeing in the grass!
shocking! has your kid done that before?
no!  all of the neighbors were out there _comma_  too!
i got into an argument with my husband and i realized later that he was right but i never apologized .  :(
maybe you should find him and apologize right now . 
yes maybe i should but my ego gets in the way . 
you could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead .  
that is a cool idea! thanks for the great advice! i will do that right now .  :)
your welcome! glad i could help!
i m unemployed and struggling right now .  i feel really bad when people talk to me about their new stuff _comma_  even though they re not trying to be mean
i can understand the feeling _comma_  i went through a couple of spells like that in the past .  i m sure they mean well but you re at a point where you re hurting to get back out there . 
yeah! i just want to be able to support myself and not go to the food bank or rely on friends and family
you ll return to self sufficiency soon _comma_  you just can t let yourself fall into a pit of self doubt .  stay confident . 
i am so sad .  my   dogs attacked my baby goat and she died last night from the injuries .  crying . 
aww _comma_  that s so sad .  i m an animal lover so i understand the pain . 
it hurts really bad and i don t know what to do .  i think i should give some dogs away to a family with no small animals . 
that s a really tough decision either way .  i wish you the best with it and hope everything improves
thanks for listening my friend . 
one of my love birds had a baby but she is a terrible mother .  so i am now taking care of the baby and feeding her everyday .  she is so cute!
ah what a responsibly to take on! you are a great example _comma_  is it quite tough?
no .  the baby bird just sleeps and eats do it is really easy .  
alot easier than a kitten or a puppy then?
yes! i think so _comma_  haha!
keep up the good work!
i feel very happy that i moved out in the country .  i thought i was a city person but i guess not . 
i bet you can see the stars and hear all sorts of wildlife at night . 
oh yes .  it was hard to get used to at first but now i barely notice it . 
all that outside noise can become so soothing if you left it . 
yes i think so .  i especially enjoy this night owl that hoo s everynight . 
living out in the woods can really make you put things in perspective too . 
sure does .  your welcome to visit any time my friend . 
thanks that is quite the offer .  how kind . 
i really wanted to go on this fruitarian trip to bali buti could not get off work .  my friends went without me
did you wait until the last minute to ask for time off?
no .  my boss is not a very nice person .  i think i should find a new job . 
yeah you might want to look into it then
thanks for your advice my friend!
my dog is feeling sick and i don t know what is wrong . 
oh no! have you tried taking your dog to the vet?
i hate the vets .  they charge so much money .  maybe i can google seomthing . 
yes _comma_  google has a lot of great information for pet care . 
thanks fo your advice my friend!
i am learning how to do day trading and did my first trade and i won
well that sounds like a high stress occupation!
you think? it sure is exciting _comma_  at least when i win . 
i m glad you like it .  i think it would be hard to get it right every time the way the market is sometimes . 
your right .  let s see how i do next week . 
i wish you the very best with it all!
thanks my friend!
you re welcome .  be careful not to chase stocks too hard _comma_  they don t always turn the way you might hope!
my dogs keep attacking my poor ducks .  i don t know what to do
i don t know what you can do .  a duck is just a toy that taste good to a dog . 
i scream at the dogs and it seems to be working but i never know what can happen in the future . 
dogs gonna do dog stuff .  that s just how they do . 
yep .  talk to later my friend . 
i packing to go on an international trip .  i hope i don t forget anything . 
that would be bad you should double check before you leave
i feel i can t fit anything else in my suitcase so i think i have it all .  but i will double check like you said .  :)
yeah it is better to be safe than sorry
you are so right! see you when i get back my friend!
i was ashamed when my dog started barking loudly when i was away . 
why were you ashamed? did she disturb the neighbors or something?
yes _comma_  my neighbors were very angry . 
i m sorry that happened .  you might need to get her obedience training _comma_ 
i am exciting that my father said he would come and visit me soon .  he travels so much and it is hard to get his time
thats awesome! do yall have any plans? 
we are just going to hang out on the farm and hang out with the cows _comma_  ha ha
lol maybe yall could find something to bond over
we have a great relationship so just each others company is good enough . 
oh how i miss my days when i was in my twenties .  those were such fun times .  to be young and free!
yeah we dont thinnk about how special it was until it is gone
it is so true .  we take it for granted .  i wish i knew then what i know now . 
yeah we all do but we can only go forward
very true my friend . 
my cockatiel is feeling sick .  i think she might die soon .  i wish there was something i could do . 
have you taken her to the vet?
no .  there are no vets where i live .  i gave her some medicine though but nothing seems to be working . 
you might want to look up what is going on online
that is a good idea .  i will take a look .  thanks my friend . 
yesterday i notice people were laughing behind me  _comma_   when i finally got to my desk  _comma_   a coworker pointed out that a postage stamp was stuck to the back of my head
that sucks .  next time they should tell you instead of laughing!
well looking back its funny   _comma_    but man   _comma_    yesterday i wished i could hide   _comma_    plus i think my boss seen it too
i m sure it s not so bad .  at least you can laugh about it now!
i am up for a promotion at my job .  i positive i will get it . 
that is great! you should celebrate and enjoy this momment
 i already have plans to go out to a nice restaurant and celebrate with my family
that is good! i hope you enjoy yourself
i have a big presentation at my job at the end of this week .  i am ready for it
awesome! what s it about?
its about how some customers are not choosing our slow moving products .  i have been working on it for weeks .  i got it nailed down
congrats! i hope it goes well .  are you presenting to a board of directors?
a neighbor  just bought a brand new lexus _comma_   why can t i get one
maybe you can save more and be able to get one . 
its not just that _comma_  this neighbor is always buying expensive things and likes to show them off
man that gets to me when someone does that  _comma_  like they are better than everyone else . 
i really miss the holidays when our family got together
the holidays are a great time for that sort of thing .  what did your family do together?
just the normal stuff _comma_   but the kids are all grown up . holidays are never the same without having kids around to enjoy it
i understand what you mean .   i hope you and your family are all able to get together and enjoy each other s company soon . 
there is a job promotion coming up .  i really do wish i can get it
i hope you can have you applied or did you interview already?
i have interview for it and thinking i might get it but you never know
well have you practiced interviewing? with that you can feel so much better!
i thought i was going to get a promotion .  i found out i did not get it
i m sorry to hear that .  hopefully something better is coming along for you soon . 
thank you _comma_  i was really depending on this promotion
keep working hard and i think your efforts will eventually be noticed . 
my pet dog pooped all over my rug last week .  she never did that before
ah that always sucks _comma_  did she need to go out or is she sick or something?
i don t know  _comma_   she never did that before  _comma_   i don t know if the crap or her behavior got to me more
well it isn t as if she did it on purpose dogs always have a reason . 
ugh _comma_  i have a cavity and i do not want to go to the dentist
oh no _comma_  is it painful and disrupting you in anyway? 
its painful but the thought of it being pulled kind of freaks me out plus the cost of it . 
yeah   _comma_    i know what you mean it does sound very scary   _comma_    but they do numb your face and usually they do not pull it out   _comma_    they fill in the cavity! 
we didn t really have anything planned this last weekend _comma_  so were thinking we d be productive . 
what did you do?
well  _comma_   plans got changed .   it rained like crazy  _comma_   so we couldn t work outside . 
it has been raining a lot here too .  definitely ruins a weekend planned outside of the house . 
it was okay _comma_  though .  we got to spend some time hanging out and had a low key weekend . 
that s good _comma_  sometimes it s good to just be lazy inside the house . 
i still haven t been able to finish my dad s father s day gift . 
so are you making him a gift?
yeah _comma_  we re rebuilding a porch swing for him .   but i ve had to hunt down some tooling . 
don t worry about it you will get it done and he will be proud of it
thanks _comma_  i hope so!
i have to fly out of town next week .  i do not know if i can _comma_  i have cold sweats thinking about it
do you have a general fear of flying _comma_  or is there something about this trip?
it s the fear of flying _comma_  just the thought of it frightens me
have you always had a fear of flying?  i haven t ever really feared it _comma_  but i don t like it . 
man _comma_  i really thought today could be a crazy day . 
was it another boring day today? 
well  _comma_   it sort of turned out that way .   there was a big event at work today  _comma_   and i wasn t sure how it would go . 
ohh okay i see _comma_  yeah i always get excited when new things happen at work too .  
over the weekend i  fell off my diet by eating a big bag of peanut m&ms
i know the feeling .  hang in there! tomorrow is always a new day 
you know the worst part of it  _comma_   is that i hid it from my partner who is proud of me dieting  _comma_   i feel bad for it
did you hide the wrappers?
i always buy the same brand of yogurt and don t even bother trying other kinds .  it s just so delicious and such a good price that i m a loyal customer for life
there s very few brands i feel that strongly about .  what kind of yogurt is it _comma_  i might want to try it?
astro balkan plain! it s not as pastey as greek yogurt _comma_  or runny like other kinds
i don t think i have ever seen that kind in the store  _comma_   i ll have to look for it next time i go .  i don t care much for the runny yogurt  _comma_   but i like greek yogurt so long as it s whole fat and sweet . 
i lost my job because i got diagnosed with a chronic disease .  it s a real double whammy   loss of income and an incurable disease .  i m still angry and upset _comma_  three months later . 
that is horrible .  americas government wont be of help . hopefully you have family?
no i m all by myself
no cat or dog?
have you ever had a strong attachment and love for an animal?   i have had several . 
yes i love animals and have   dogs right now . 
well then you will understand the love i had for my pitbull named lily .    we had a special bond and when she died it broke my heart .   never leave a candle burning and leave the house .    our house burned and she died of smoke inhalation .   i will never forget her!
i m sorry that happened to you and i will take your advice . 
once during a snowstorm i had to go to the airport .  my taxi driver decided that driving on the highway in the middle of nowhere late at night was the perfect time to tell me all about how he would kill a man
that sounds super scary _comma_  could he tell that your were scared or nervous? how did you escape that situation?
i shrank into myself and prayed for the car to go faster and not crash
oh wow _comma_  it s fortunate that you managed to get out of that situation alive .  i m glad you made it out of that awful situation .  
one time there was a homeless guy running towards my car
that sounds a little scary .  why was he running towards your car?
he wanted money!
did you give him any?
no!
i m really stressed today so i bought a box of pirate peanut butter cookies and ate an entire sleeve of them .  i feel pretty bad because i wrecked my dieting for at least two days
aww   _comma_    i am sorry   _comma_    but i must say pirate peanut butte cookies do sound good   _comma_    did they help you feel any better?
in the short term _comma_  yes! they re oatmeal and peanut butter
ugh  _comma_   that sounds wonderful  _comma_   i would do the same if i were stressed i think
one time i saw a person juggle chainsaws
that s amazing .  were you impressed?
yes _comma_  he did it perfectly and did not hurt himself
that must take a lot of practice .  i can t even juggle safe objects so i d likely lose an arm if i tried to juggle chainsaws lol
i m very ready for school to start!
me _comma_  too!  i work at the registration department at a college and we re very busy until school starts . 
there s just something so nostalgic about going to school .  reminds me of my childhood . 
i think it s the feeling of the beginning of something new . 
one time my mom made me lunch when i was too busy working!
wow that is so sweet of her .  she must really love you! 
i hope so! she always helps me and one day i will return the favor!
wow that is fantastic _comma_  she is so lucky to have you around because you are such a sweet and caring person .  :) 
my friend got a new job and i wish i had it too . 
good for you friend! i m sure you ll find something soon .  what field of work do you want to be in?
i work in video production .  super fun job _comma_  but i m tired of the freelance life . 
that does sound like a really fun job .  i also work freelance and would also like something more stable .  
one time my family went out to vacation and i was home alone with no friends
oh no _comma_  they went on vacation without you?? 
yes _comma_  i had to work and could not get time off!
oh no that sucks _comma_  i am sorry that you had to stay home alone .  what did you do to entertain yourself? 
my pet cat died recently
oh no _comma_  i am so sorry to hear that .  how are you holding up? 
i am doing okay _comma_  my cat was old and is probably in a better place now : (
yes _comma_  i am sure that your cat is in a better place .  if you ever want to talk to someone about it i am always here to listen .  :) 
i am ready for my law exam
the big one? the bar? that s a whole lot of schooling and effort culminating in to one test! i imagine you re very excited _comma_  but anxious too . 
luckily not the bar yet! just the end of summer class . 
ahh .  still _comma_  another stone set on the road to payoff .  i wish you the best!
i knew i was ready for my college exam . 
you study hard?
i did .  failed my last so i knew i had to make it right . 
oh no _comma_  i bet you aced this one then . 
my brother keeps not washing the dishes!
oh no _comma_  have you talked to him about it? 
yes! he is such a manchild! he does not care about cleanliness!
aww man  _comma_   that sucks  _comma_   i am guessing that you end up having to do all the dirty work because he has been slacking off .  
i was so mad when my dog got my dinner off the table . 
oh i would be pissed .  hopefully you had more so you could fix another plate . 
i did _comma_  but he knows better . 
guessing he didn t get anymore food for dinner lol . 
i visited my college campus today and memories came flooding back .  i miss it . 
i d imagine so .  what a great time of our lives college can be .  the world just seems right  _comma_   being surrounded by your peers  _comma_   all sharing similar goals .  
it was so great .  we all just wanted to learn . 
mmhm .  i wish i studied more    _comma_     paid more attention    _comma_     and joined more clubs .  but i guess that s the thing    _comma_     you re already as busy as it gets    _comma_     and unfortunately you can t experience it all . 
i think i will pass my college test tomorrow . 
 that is great _comma_  confidence is always a key in success! i believe that you will pass as well! 
thank you .  i m ready for it to be over with . 
yeah i bet! you will do great _comma_  i have high hopes in you! :) 
i was a bit upset when my parents could not visit me this weekend . 
aw _comma_  that stinks .  why couldn t they come?
my dad had to work last minute .  i got everything ready for them .  oh well . 
that sounds really disappointing .  hopefully _comma_  you ll be able to see them soon! i m sure they were excited too . 
i was grossed out when i saw someone vomiting at a bar . 
oh man _comma_  i bet you did .  i would have had a gag reflex if i saw some one puking at the bar .  
they couldn t even make it to the bathroom .  ugh . 
wow they must have had   too many drinks if they could not even get to the bathroom .  i am sorry you had to see such a disgusting sight 
i m very scared of the afterlife
me too _comma_  it s so hard not knowing what to expect . 
and we do not even know if we have an afterlife . 
right  _comma_   no one truly knows until they get there  _comma_   so scary . 
i was very happy just reading a book by the pool today
what was the book about?
it was about the golden state killer .  very errie . 
i m glad you were happy reading the book . 
i was very nervous for my first day of freshman year in college . 
oh _comma_  i understand .  i also remember mine .  do you remember something else about that day?
i could not find my classes .  it was almost comical . 
i imagine it was a big college .  what did happen at the end?
one time i won a stuffed animal from the claw machine!
me too! i love that game!
yup _comma_  i did it in my first try too!
i saw a machine one time that you could win live lobsters .  they would cook it for you if you won . 
i was so happy when my mom came to visit me
nice! how long has it been since you last saw her?
  months .  way too long!
man _comma_  i hope you two do something fun!
i am scared of spiders!
all spiders or just the poisonous ones?
any of them .  i hate all their creepy legs . 
thats fair i guess _comma_  weird fish freak me out more then spiders through
my sister came over to my house the other day .   she was quick to show off her new iphone   . 
wow _comma_  is she an older or younger sibling? 
she is    years younger than i am _comma_  and quite spoiled .   she always has the  nicest things . 
aww man that sucks  _comma_   one day your hard work will pay off  _comma_   so don t let it get to you too much .  i am sure she is not intentially doing that
one time i saw a giant cockroach under my desk!
omg! i hate cockroaches _comma_  they are ugly insects 
yes! they are so creepy with how fast and nasty they are 
were you able to kill it? what did you do?
i sprayed it with raid
well done .  i hope you dont find anymore _comma_  they are scary .  
i thought it was so cool that my friend did a backflip . 
wow! that is really cool .  did he land the back flip?
he did! i didn t know he could do that . 
what prompted his back flip?
i forgot to invite my friend to dinner with our other friends . 
it happens sometimes .   it only becomes a problem if you forget often . 
luckily i have not done it too many times . 
i hope they were pretty understanding . 
one time i wanted to eat at burger king _comma_  but then i remembered that i was loyal to mcdonalds
i hate burger king! mcd s all the way
your dam right! even if the food is small _comma_  it tastes so good!
adding mac sauce to a cheeseburger is a game changer
i was upset when i did not do well on a test . 
that is unfortunate _comma_  did you fail the test?
not exactly _comma_  but close enough .  i will study better next time . 
you got this! i believe in you!
i was so mad when my friend forgot my birthday
wow! did you tell them anything?
i did a few days later .  they seemed sorry . 
you should stop being their friend!
one time my friend said that i could tell him anything and she would snitch
oh _comma_  snitches are no fun . 
yes _comma_  snitches get stiches
i would just keep to myself . 
i remember years ago when i was a teenager .   i didnt treat her as well as i should have . 
who?
oh so sorry _comma_  i meant to say i didnt treat my mother as well as i should have .   i often treated her with disrespect and disobedience . 
well i think as long as you say sorry _comma_  she can forgive . 
my dog kept barking and waking me up
i know how annoying that can be .   i love dogs but they certainly get do annoying things at times . 
i still do not know why he was barking . 
maybe there was something outside or maybe he just wanted attention .    dogs behavior can be hard to figure out sometimes .    good luck!
one time i pooped my pants when i was trying to fart
i have done that before .  it is not fun . 
yup! i had to walk home in shame!
i hope you threw out those pants . 
my dog learned a new trick today!
ooh _comma_  what kind of trick did she learn?
shaking hands! so cute
aww! i wish i had a dog now!
i m so ready for football season
american football or soccer?
american football!
okay .  i m not really a fan of it . 
i could not believe that donald trump won the election . 
yeah _comma_  that was a surprising result . 
i still do not know what to make of it
does it make you feel like you re living in an alternate reality?
i did not like being alone at home at night . 
it can be scary at times .  how do you deal with it?
i try to go to bed earlier . 
that is a good way .  i have a dog that makes me feel safe .  do you have anything like that?
my family left for the weekend and i m so bored . 
you can watch some movies
what should i watch?
it depends on your preference .  i watch korean dramas . 
i have realized that i have it good in life
life is always a lot better when the sun is shining . 
yes  _comma_   i appreciate everything  _comma_   even the sun 
when the sun is shining walking and seeing the beautiful sights makes me smile . 
i can definiely count on my best friend for anything
that is good you have someone to share your happiness and problems with
it is .  do you?
my best friend is my boyfriend .  so i share everything with him
i love volunteering . 
same here! where do you volunteer at?
the humane society .  i just love animals . 
that is so generous of you! have you ever thought of joining a volunteer organization?
something terrible happened .  i discovered i have cankles
what are those
it is a terrible disease where your ankles and calves are fused together
??? is it a cancer of some sort??
i love to volunteer for others
that is excellent! i wish i had the courage to do so _comma_  too .  
you should try! it is fun!
i think it would be fun to help someone build a house . 
i was nervous for my first day of college . 
oh yeah? was it because you didn t know if you could do the work _comma_  or because of all the hot college girls
just nervous for new beginnings . 
well how did it go? did you do well?
i played with and hugged my dog all day today!
that must be nice .  i wish i had one . 
you should! they need a lot of attention though!
yes _comma_  they do .  and lots of care . 
i was nervous for my first day of college
what about it made you feel nervous?
just nervous for a new start in life
yeah i understand .  big life changes make me feel uneasy sometimes too . 
just nervous for a new start
i  found some pictures of my dog i had to put down .  i miss her
i lost my dog last year _comma_  i miss her too .  
dogs are too good to us
i agree _comma_  they are the best .  
i realized i am happy with life
that must feel good . 
yes _comma_  i am starting to appreciate lots of small things in life!
small things like what?
one time my mom gave my brother a happy meal _comma_  and i got nothing!
wow thats completely unfair!
yup _comma_  it scarred me for life .  i have mental issues now
well i mean sounds like favortism to me .  siblings always get the better things 
i love to play lottery scratch offs!   i once won      on one . 
wow _comma_  lucky you .  i play those once in a year only
i can understand that _comma_  as i usually dont have the money to play to very often .   i couldnt wait to go cash it in .   
i do not play too much because if i do not win _comma_  i feel it is a waste of money . 
i studied all night for a test .  i think i can pass it _comma_  even though i was sleepy
well that s good .  what s the subject?
organic chemistry!
i hate chemistry because i think we should leave all that stuff to nature and just live our lives as the animals we are
i agree!
do you have a good teacher?
one time they gave me ketchup packets instead of spicy sauce .  i was so mad!
wow that is annoying .  did you get a spicy packet after?
no _comma_  i was pouting all day! 
that is okay _comma_  mistakes happen all the time . 
one time when i was drinking coffee _comma_  all the memories of my childhood kept coming back
did you drink a lot of coffee when you were a child?
no _comma_  but i like losing myself in my thoughts when drinking coffee!
i see  _comma_   that is such a nice way to remember your past  _comma_   . 
one time i studied all week for my final exam! i think i can pass now!
well did you pass or did you fail?
i failed unfortunately _comma_  but i liked my optimism!
well i guess you might want to study harder next time . 
one time i went to the doctor and i was really anticipating my test results for cancer!
oh you must love getting cancer results!
well it does get my heart beating fast!
that s why i do it _comma_  for a great cardio workout .  so what were the results?
one time my house started flooding from a hurricane!
and then what happened??
i woke up
and then what happened
one time i skipped my friend s birthday party to watch tv
i hope something good was on
there was! but i felt so bad afterwards .  i m a monster
yeah you are .  what show was it?
one time my mom bought an ice cream from mcdonalds!
really? what kind of icecream?
a plain vanilla one .  it is rare since their machine is always broken!
that is a good one! it is not always broken though .  sometimes they are out of ice cream mix because the workers eat it all
one time when i was little _comma_  i was scared of going to sleep without a night light
that is a rational fear when you are little .  how did you overcome it?
i became depressed and i felt nothing
oh that is a bad place to go
one time there was this really cool person i was talking to on a chatroom
oh really? what were you guys talking about?
about topics that really impressed us .  it was you   
aww that s so sweet   
one time a person offered to drive me home when it was raining outside
he must be a good person bit if he s a stranger _comma_  is it safe?
it was super creepy _comma_  i did not take the offer !
that is good safety first
 my cat passed away because of old age
i am sorry to hear that! what was its name?
i called him pizza guy
that is cute! is there a meaning behind that name?
in all my relationships _comma_ i always choose to honest as much as i can .  i never want to my partner to stop believing in me
that is good! never accept anything less!
exactly _comma_ you receive what you get .  nothing less . 
i m rooting for you! get your dream person!
one time i kept waiting for this person to respond to my texts .  he never did
i can imagine how it feel _comma_ more so if its someone who never leaves his her phone down . 
yes _comma_  i do not like being ignored  :(
the writing is very clear on the wall .  you have been ignored . 
i m starting university in two days and i m kind of stressed because i ll be studying with new teachers and i have no idea what they will be like
wow _comma_  that sounds intense! i hope you ll find out there was nothing to be stressed about after all!
yeah but i hate having mean teachers  _comma_  the ones that are not open for different ways of explaining things .  so i really hope i won t have anyone like that
well i hope you won t have any of those mean teachers! maybe you ll have some awesome ones?
 school is starting back up soon _comma_  i can t wait to see all my friends again!
that s sounds amazing _comma_  you
yes _comma_  me very happy!
you didn t talk to any of them during summer break? is there anyone specific you re looking forward to see?
sometimes i get scared because i fear not being able to achieve my goals in life
i feel you .  i am still scared even though i am sort of successful now!
it s that fear of not being able to control everything that hurts the most
uncertainty is the only certainty!
i like to work with people who are fast on their feet and get things very fast . 
have you always felt that way or have changed your view over time?
that is just me _comma_ we seem to get a lot of things done within a short period of time . 
well that is a good way of doing things as long are you getting the job right in my opinion . 
i will release my project soon _comma_  and i m so excited because i worked insanely hard on it
yes i believe in you
thank you _comma_  i m believe in myself and all the hard work i put in this project
your hard work will not fail you
my new car was extremely damaged in a road accident last week being my very first car _comma_ i;m shuttered
i m so sorry .  : ( 
to make it worse _comma_ i was the one on the wrong .  the insurance is seeming difficult to compensate . 
well _comma_  at least you came out without an injury? or did you . 
i m very excited about this weekend .  two days with literally no plans and no responsibilities!
dang! what are going to do with all that free time!?
the plan is to just relax .  maybe some tv or a book . 
nice! well i hope you have a nice and relaxing weekend!
one time i found a cockroach in my hamburger! omg!
oh my god _comma_  that sounds like the most terrifying thing ever! where was this so i know never to go there?
it was at mcdonalds!
not surprising .  how long did it take you before you were able to eat a burger again?
i hate seeing all those people breaking their promises just so they can follow their desires and wishes
what kind of promises? who hurt you?
nobody hurted me  _comma_  it s just seeing people get hurt is kind of annoying for me
what is the worst hurt you ve ever seen?
nobody hurted me  _comma_  it s just seeing people get hurt is kind of annoying for me
so i hear . 
i was happy because my best friend called me to ask about his first time moving away from home . 
wow that sounds like good news!
yeah .  he was going to college .  he went for a couple years .  he didn t finish there .  
i m glad to hear he has moved on with his life! a huge step forward . 
once i was going to get fried chicken _comma_  but then i remembered i was loyal to only eating vegetables
wait _comma_  you forgot you re vegetarian? that must ve been pretty shocking
my girlfriend makes me! and she is always watching!
oooo you have to be sneaky with your meat habits _comma_  my friend
i love helping people _comma_  just seeing that smile after you finish helping them makes me so happy!
who have you helped recently?
well _comma_  i always help this old man to cross the road . 
that s really kind of you .  does the old man appreciate it?
well you see  _comma_   i do it more for myself   _comma_   i don t really mind if the other people appreciate it or not it s more for me to be a better person . 
you are a good example to others . 
i can tell my best friend anything!
sounds like a great friend! do they just listen or offer helpful advice?
i usually ask her for advice and tell her embarrassing stories because she never snitches!
loyal and caring .  you ve got a winner on your hands!
i;m living my best life .  i could not be any happier .  
good to know .  and what makes you life so good _comma_  huh?
family is doing great _comma_  bussines is booming
what if it all comes crashing down on you!
one time i stole something from the grocery store when i was little
did your mother find out?
no _comma_  but the guilt haunted me for a long time!
how have you managed it? have you thought about returning to the store and admitting to it?
there was a race in high school i should have won .  i didn t see the guy trying to pass me as he was coming out of the last turn . 
that sounds unfair .  maybe you ll get another chance to win . 
the funny part was i threw the baton at the end and got my team disqualified for the race . 
oh wow  _comma_   well there is always another chance  _comma_   we all learn on mistakes . 
in my spare time i like to watch tech reviewers on youtube .   but whenever i see their high end gaming pc setups it makes me want something as good for myself . 
i am not much of a gamer myself .  what is your favourite game?
my favorite game is assassin s creed .   it has a great story .   when i see it running on a gamer s expensive pc i wish i could get that performance . 
you need to save your money to be able to afford it . 
i let people so much in my life and they ve ended up betraying my confidence i had in them .  
i can sympathize with you .  i ve had a lot of betrayal in the past .  the only thing to do is to continue looking for trustworthy individuals .  
i have learnt the hard way _comma_ keep your friend circle small . 
not for naught but _comma_  a dog won t ever betray you   
one time i was building a tower of cards that was over   layers tall .  it fell when someone walked by
oh my god _comma_  did it take a lot of work? and did it annoy you when it fell down?
yes it took me over an hour! i was so mad!
maybe this time you can do it somewhere alone?
do you ever feel lonely? i do .  i hate my own company and i have no friends . 
same .  i hate my life .  i sit in front of my computer all day
i do too _comma_  it s normal to runaway and sit in front of your computer i guess
well i hope things turn out better for you
i m ashamed of always deceiving my family . 
why do you do it?
i don t do it on purpose  _comma_  it s them they want me to be a doctor but i don t like medicine . 
oh i see .  what do you want to do instead?
i had a fight with my sibling today and she started shouting at me and it really annoyed me
that s unfortunate .  did you make up afterwards?
no  _comma_   she still doesn t want to apologise for what she did  _comma_   but eve she doesn t i m gonna talk to her today!
that s good .  you guys are siblings after all and should try to get along . 
the possibility of winning a lottery this time is high for me
hi _comma_  what makes you think that?
bruh _comma_ my instincts can t be wrong .  i just have this crazy feeling that i might be lucky this time round . 
fair enough my friend _comma_  would you say your chances are high because of signs of other people winning around you recently?
i recently discovered that my father is sick  _comma_  i tried to contact my mother to see what happened but she didn t answer .  i m so mad at her because she didn t even try to call me again . 
could she just be too distraught to pick up a phone? i agree that she owes that much to you but _comma_  maybe shes too broken atm
i got really angry and i m so worried about my father .  so i m gonna go visit my parents and check on them this weekend . 
hopefully you don t live too far .  i know this is a random chat but  _comma_   i genuinely hope your father is okay .  i don t have a dad so  _comma_   cherish every moment you get . 
the coolest place i ve ever been was an island in the caribbean .  no cars _comma_  only golf cars .     % touristy village . 
golf is by far my favourite hobby _comma_  this sounds awesome! what island was it?
caye caulker .  maybe a vacation for your partner .  there s a snorkeling place there .  the coolest things though was that it was unlike anywhere i ve ever been . 
i will have a look at it on my lunch break today! i did snorkelling in the philippines at it was amazing .   that was on the island of coron
my embarassing moment is when our thermostat was broken and my boss came in _comma_  and i had my shirt off .  only problem i guess is it would have been weird if he had had a client with him . 
ooooof lmao do you work in an office?
yeah _comma_  insurance .  no client though thankfully . 
thank goodness .  you really dodged a bullet on that one
i m finally gonna get some rest _comma_  i m going on a holiday in two weeks and i really can t wait!
oh boy oh boy oh boy where are you going??
i m going to greece .  i can t wait to see all the greek gods up close . 
well  _comma_   i don t want to break it to you  _comma_   but those guys are fictional . 
i was nervous about a secret i had but i hated keeping it bottled up . 
did the secret negatively affect others?
no _comma_  but some kind person came up to me and promised not to tell anybody . 
i can understand that feeling .  well _comma_  if it was pretty innocuous there s no harm and keeping confidentialiy
i am looking forward to getting a promotion .  i have to hire   people . 
oh wow more responsibility! i bet the pay raise will be welcome
yes _comma_  a couple more levels and it will be easier . 
sweet! sounds like a good job .  how are the bosses?
i love my wife because she s loyal and she always takes care of me . 
thats a wonderful thing how long have you been married?
for over   years now .  
very nice its always good to find a faithful and loving woman
when i was younger i did something i was very embarrassed about
we all make mistakes  _comma_  what s important is to learn from them! and you were young so it s okay you know?
yeah it was something a stupid kid does _comma_  i went into a comic book store with a friend and tried to steal a lot of comics but we were caught and i learned it was bad to steal
it s good that you learned from your mistake!
my wife is the best thing to happen to me since sliced bread
that s awesome! tell me about her . 
i ve been with her for    years and she s wonderful mother and wife and always puts her family first

i had a cat that i loved so much and one day i came home and i found out he had been ran over .

how old was he?
   _comma_  i had him for    years . 
our company is firing people _comma_  and everyone is very sad to go
oh no _comma_  i am so sorry to hear that .  it s stressful .  i hope your job is safe?
mine is good _comma_  i just feel bad for the people who got fired you know?
totally .  i can t imagine losing my job .  luckily the economy is pretty good _comma_  so maybe they will find new jobs quickly .  
i m moving out from this house and it s just very emotional . 
why are you moving?
well _comma_  my university is in a different city so i m leaving everyone here to follow my dreams . 
i would feel emotional too with such a big transition in life .  i am sure you will enjoy university though
when my grandparents died _comma_  i was extremely upset for a few months
were they close to you? 
i was really close with my grandpa on my father s side .  i used to spend every summer with them when i was as child 
that makes sense why you got upset but in the end we re all gonna follow them and you never now you may see them again
my whole world revolves around my family they make me very happy
that is so heartwarmingly sweet .  i know exactly how you feel since my family means the world to me as well . 
they are my reason to live for sure _comma_  i don t look forward to my kids growing up and moving out
it s true they grow up so fast .  this is why we should appreciate every second we have with them . 
i have been in my job for   years now _comma_  and i feel quite comfortable and happy here
what do you do?
i am a project manager .  i started off very junior _comma_  and now i have worked my way up in the company
oh wow  do you have a college degree?
when i had to clear out my old bedroom when i left home _comma_  i really found it hard to throw away a lot of the stuff in there!
why do you find it hard to throw away old stuff
just thinking of all the good times i had with toys   books etc when i was a child! even though i wouldn t use these things again _comma_  it was still hard to throw away 
so what are you planning to do
i ended up giving it to charity   that way someone else can have good times with them! 
i got really drunk on my birthday this year _comma_  and couldn t remember what i did .  it was very awkward meeting my friends the next day
oh no  _comma_   i ve had that happen before  _comma_   it is the worst .  i hope it wasn t too bad for you!
it  wasn t that bad in the end _comma_  but it was the fear of not remembering anything! 
i understand that all too well! i m glad it wasn t too bad though .  i ve had some pretty embarrassing things happen while hungover . 
i got really drunk on my birthday and was horrible to one of my oldest friends _comma_  i felt awful
did you apologise to him? maybe next time try to not drink a lot so you can control yourself?
i did apologise to him the next day  _comma_   and i had a lot of making up to do .  i don t usually get nasty when i drink alcohol  _comma_   but this has made me be more careful 
i m glad it made you more aware of what you re doing . 
the future looks bright though right now things are not going as i had planned
what are you going to do to change that?
keep doing my best in whatever i do .  i m sure all shall be well . 
keep your head up high _comma_  good positive thinking .

you are such a sweet soul .  they say adopt and rescue  _comma_ don t buy
when i gave a best man speech at my dad s wedding _comma_  i knew that i was going to do well and make everyone laugh
i wish i could have heard your speech .  it must have been really funny . 
i don t think anybody recorded it which is a shame! my dad loved it though which is the main thing 
i hope he had a wonderful wedding .  he must have been proud of you . 
the last interview i went to  _comma_   i studied the company  _comma_   as well as the role .  i felt like i had all the info i needed to succeed

you must be really proud of yourself .  that sounds really fulfilling!

its fair that way
my younger sister who is    years is pregnant with her    years old boyfriend .  arrrgh

i hate it when that happens! i hope you didn t hurt yourself _comma_  and that somebody tried to help? 
i remember when i submitted my cv to a company  _comma_   i couldn t wait to get a response  _comma_   hoping that it was positive!
how did it eventually go?
i got the good response i was anticipating .  i put a lot of work into my cv  _comma_   and the application  _comma_   so i was very happy with the result 
congratulations on a new job
i was upset not to get a response back from a company that i applied for a job at
oh no  _comma_   i am sorry to hear that .  that really sucks  _comma_   maybe you can reapply soon?
i suppose i could  _comma_   but i m not sure i want to apply again as they didn t treat with any respect  _comma_   and ignored my application 
i can understand that .  i think the next company you apply for will be your time to shine!
my parents tried to make me eat some gone off food once _comma_  it made me really ill

i got caught drinking under age .  i got off without being charged _comma_  but it was very scary! 
where did they take you? back to your parents or to the police station?
they took me back to my parents _comma_  but i think they just wanted to give me a bit of a scare! 
did it work? did you ever do it again?
i didn t do it for a long time _comma_  but i eventually did as i got a bit older 
well try to stay out of trouble now you are a bit older!
when my dad told me he was getting married _comma_  i was over the moon
were you happy for him? or did you get sad because you didn t want that to happen?
i was delighted for him  _comma_   his new wife is so great for him  _comma_   and she s always been really cool to me 
that s great _comma_  i m glad she s nice to you . 
 when i got told that i had a new job _comma_  i was over the moon
that s wonderful news _comma_  congratulations! are you going to celebrate?
i am definitely going to celebrate! it is my dream job 
i am so happy for you .  you should get a nice dinner with your family . 
i stole money from my dad once _comma_  i felt terrible for ages
did he find out?
he did eventually _comma_  i actually told him when the guilt got too much for me 
thats good you told him .  thats a lot to keep inside .  hopefully he wasnt mad
i cheated on my ex girlfriend _comma_  and i felt bad about it ever since
ohhhh _comma_  that is so bad .  why did you cheat?
i got drunk   i felt really guilty about it
oh no _comma_  sorry about that .  but have you confessed to her
when i proposed to my girlfriend _comma_  she said yes! i was so happy
well that s great news congratulations _comma_  how long have you known each other?
we have known each other for   years _comma_  and been dating for     felt like the right time
that s good that you put a lot of effort into it
i remember when i was in my    s i was so drunk that i accidently went into the womans rest room
haha _comma_  amazing! did you get shouted at?
no but a lot of people saw me do it and my face went beet red
that s really embarassing! did any of your friends poke fun at you for it? 
i need new carpet for my house so i cannot wait to get my income tax return this year
what happened exactly? is it just old and moldy?
no its just    years old and needs to be replaced
at least you got your moneys worth! are you going to have it installed?
i remember growing up and having some really good family vacations
that is so lovely
yes i had a good childhood with wonderful memories even though we didn t have a lot of money
memories are good to be kept in the medulla .  good old days .  you really had a good time
when i proposed to my wife i knew she was going to say yes i just felt it
aw .  when you know _comma_  you know .  how did you do it?
i was rather cheesy and proposed to her on christmas 
i bet it was really special though! christmas is such a beautiful time of year .  when are you getting married?
in the relationships i have been in i have never cheated _comma_  i have suspicions that the guys i was with did though . 
that s too bad .  do you have proof of infidelity?
not really _comma_  but my one boyfriend was always very flirty and liked hooking up with girls a lot
it s good that you re faithful .  too bad your boyfriend couldn t be less flirtatious and respect you more . 
a new restaurant opened near my house _comma_  and it turned out to be really really nice
what kind of food does it serve? sounds wonderful!
it is a spanish restaurant _comma_  and they serve steaks and fish chargrilled .  it is my new favourite place to eat! 
surf and turf! that s what they called a steak served with seafood .  it s very yummy!
i felt totally relaxed when i was outside watching my kids play in the pool . 
that s good _comma_  i love relaxing outside by a pool . 
yeah it was like i had no stress . 
that s always a good feeling . 
my dog was chewing on dead frog .  so gross!! i hope it was not poisonous . 
oh man dogs are crazy! my dog killed a cat recently _comma_  i hope it s not poison!! is he okay?
he seems to be ok but if he start salivating then for sure there is poison .  i will have to run to vet!!
oh no _comma_  you are a good dog owner though
thanks! i think i am if i save his life .  :)
when i bought my house i made sure i had everything all ready including my down payment
sounds like you are doing all the right things .  did anything go wrong?
no it took   weeks to close and no issues came up
oh that is great! congratulations on your knew home! that must be so exciting!
i am so happy today because my peacocks just had   babies! they are so cute!
that s the coolest thing ever i didn t know you could have them as pets
oh yes! i have   adult females and one male .  i have had them for   years .  they have names and i can call them and they come running to me .  they are cool pets . 
my kids would love something like that
your neighbors can complain sometimes if they don t like noise .  they can be noisy in mating season . 
lately i hav been hearing some big monkeys howling up in the mountain .  i hope they don t come down near my house . 
monkeys!!!??? i have never heard monkeys howl .   tell me more . 
it is hard to give you an example through text but it does sound like a monster in the mountains .  kind of scary! haha
where do you live that there are monkeys in the mountains?  i live in florida _comma_  the flatlands .  lol
i live in florida too but have a second home in mexico .  they are in the jungles and are wild there . 
sounds exciting .   but i would have been scared of howling monkeys too .   i am not sure why _comma_  but the term  howling monkeys  makes me giggle . 
haha _comma_  it is a funny situation .  chat with you later my friend!
bye! watch out for those monkeys!
just heard i got the promotion i was hoping for .  i think i am going to burst . 
oh that is so exciting!!! good for you man!
thanks _comma_  i thing i am going to celebrate when i get home tonight
yeah pop that champagne!
i am on vacation in bali and i want to move here so badly .  it is the most beautiful place in the world!
that sounds awesome! what s your favorite part of your vacation so far?
i love hiking through the rice fields and the fruit here is out of this world!!
what kinds of fruit do they have there?
it is all tropical fruit like mangoes _comma_  jackfruit and durian .  lots of new interesting tastes . 
when i was about    years old i worked at a horse farm in exchange for lessons .   i would go there every weekend and all through the summer .   
that s great that they let you work in exchange for lessons .  i bet you have the best memories . 
yes i have very fond memories from those days .   i can still remember the smell of the farm and the smell of horses like it was yesterday .   i never wanted to wash the smell from my hands and i would daydream about owning my own horse someday . 
that s awesome .  do you own a horse now?
studied for my math finals for days _comma_  felt very confident on the day of the test . 
that s awesome! yeah i definitely find the more i study _comma_  the better i do .  funny how that works! 
yeah _comma_  but theres a balance .  study too much and you just burn yourself out
true .  there has to be a work school life balance .  
my dad got sick for a week and i stayed at home for a week taking care of him
well i hope he gets to felling better . 
he s better already but he got a real bad fever during that week
you should keep an eye on him older people are more prone to getting sick . 
i drank all the milk in the fridge and left nothing for anyone else .  next week i will buy extra milk for the house to make up for it . 
that s very considerate of you .  i know some people that drink it all and don t replace it . 
yeah _comma_  i have done that before and i got yelled at by everyone .  i learned my lesson .  haha
lol it happens _comma_  what s important is that you learned and care enough about your people to internalize the knowledge . 
looking through old stuff in the attic and stumbled across my old gamecube _comma_  sadly it didn t work anymore . 
awww  _comma_   i never had one  _comma_   but wanted one . 
yeah i had good memories playing with my friends
what were your favorite games?
for sure need for speed underground _comma_  loved that game
my old roommate didn t clean out his room or kitchen when he left .  my school charged the rest of us      because of him . 
wow _comma_  thats terrible .  did you get him to pay you all back?
no  _comma_   he cut off all communication .  nobody liked him anyways  _comma_   he was dirty and rude . 
well good riddance .  if you never want to see scum again _comma_  just loan them     . 
i was disappointed with the score of my final exam .  i studied real hard but got a   % on it . 
i m sorry .  it sucks when you put time and effort into studying but the grade is bad .  could you get help from your teacher or a study buddy?
yea i had a study group i just panicked when i entered the testing room i think .  it s not so bad though _comma_  i still passed the class . 
well that s good news .  i hope you do better on your next test . 
i live very far away from my family and i miss them dearly .  i feel so alone sometimes . 
aw _comma_  i know that must be hard having to take care of yourself so far from loved ones that you can depend on . 
yes it is quite hard .  but it has been my choice to move away .  i guess one day i will return but not sure when . 
that s good that you are keeping your options open and even better that you challenged yourself to leave comfort and travel . 
yeah that is my personality for sure .  at least i will have lots of stories to tell one day! 
one time in high school i sat in chocolate sauce! i didn t have a sweater to tie around my waste _comma_  so i had to borrow one from a friend . 
oh no! that s horrifying in high school! i hope you didn t get made fun of . 
one of the bully kids noticed the sweater around my waste on the warm day and knew something was up .  he really tried to embarrass me . 
kids can be so mean .  thank god that s all behind us now!
recently moved to a new dorm and when i came in the kitchen was a total disaster .  months old piles of dishes in the sink with mold and dried up old food on the stove . 
holy crap! is there not a landlord or something you can complain to?
i can but they take forever to come and clean it up .  i just talked to the guy who did it and he said he won t do it again .  spent  an hour cleaning it all up with a lot of clorox  _comma_   alcohol  _comma_   and soap . 
i m glad i never had to live with other people .  i would not be as patient as you . 
when i was waiting for my final grade report to come in .  i was scared i was going to fail my organic chem class . 
did you pass?
yeah _comma_  got a   % on the class .  not ideal but better than failing . 
absolutely .  great job!
i have complete faith in my diet .  it makes me feel great!
i completely agree _comma_  having complete control over your diet is amazing and has a ton of benefits
it s easier to maintain than people realize!
yeah _comma_  and it can be cost effective if you plan wisely!
i was driving down the highway during a heavy thunderstorm and two cars crashed in front of me and one flipped over . 
oh my goodness! that is scary! are you alright? did anyone get hurt?
yeah im alright  _comma_   i was far enough to steer clear of the chaos .  the guy that flipped had to get carried by ambulance  _comma_   but he didn t look very injured .  and the other guy was ok . 
whew! you are lucky! glad to hear everyone was ok .  
my dog died in my neighbors electrical fence last night .  i am devastated!! i don t know what to do . 
oh no  _comma_   poor dog :( i d be devastated too  _comma_   i love dogs so much . 
my heart is broken and i can t stop crying .  i feel so helpless that i could not save her .  
don t beat yourself up over it _comma_  it was a very tragic accident but who could ve known .  he s in a better place now . 
recently  _comma_   my wife and i needed a babysitter for the evening  _comma_   and my mother in law offered to watch our kids . 
that was nice of her .  did everything work out?
no   _comma_    she forgot .   which   _comma_    unfortunately   _comma_    is typical!
oh no! did you guys stillhave a nice evening?
yeah _comma_  it worked out okay to take the kids with .  it just wasn t quite as relaxing . 
yeah i thought of that .  well _comma_  the kids probably loved it!
yeah _comma_  they hate leaving mama!  they can take or leave daddy . 
i really enjoy collecting shoes _comma_  and i m hoping to get a pair of yeezy s that are restocking this october . 
very nice .   how many shoes do you have?
i have around   right now
are they all yeezys?
no _comma_  mainly adidas ultraboosts and nike
i feel so happy to live out in the country .  nature is the most beautiful thing to experience everyday!
that sounds so nice!  are you very far from grocery stores and stuff?
only about a    minute drive .  not to close and not to far .  but we grow some of our food here and we have cows and chickens too . 
yeah _comma_  that s not too bad at all!  sounds idyllic!
back in highschool when i got my first car _comma_  i was so happy and drove it around for a while and it felt so nice being free to roam . 
oh yes .   the first car is amazing
yeah its a great feeling having someone thats yours . 
yes i remember the freedom that comes with the first car . 
i feel anxious when i have to wait for people that are late .  why can t everyone just be on time?
i feel exactly the same way .   people should be more considerate and be on time for the sake of others . 
yes totally agree! maybe i should just leave and make them wait .  haha
yes _comma_  that would certainly give them a taste of their own medicine!
it s really hard to stay disciplined and watch what you eat . 
i agree _comma_  it s something i struggle with as well .  have you tried an diets you liked?
i haven t done anything specific with diets _comma_  no .   have you found one that you like?
i ve tried a few  _comma_   and i would have to say the one that i liked the most was weight watchers .  it s pretty easy to stay on  _comma_   and the food is usually good .  the only big problem is that it gets expensive . 
i think that that s a common problem with all of them . 
 it was my birthday and my whole family threw a party for me after work .  it was so unexpected!
that s so cool! did they get you anything nice?
they got me a bunch of gift cards to my favorite stores .  they are all so wonderful .  i love them so much!
time to go shoppin lol!
at the beginning of the year i missed a lot of work .   i was sick but i didnt feel like a team player at the time . 
aw im sorry .  are you doing better now?
yeah i m doing much better thanks .   i ll for sure be getting a flu shot next year!
that s a good idea .  i haven t done that in years .  i always feel like i barely dodge a bullet by not getting it . 
i have been lucky in the past but i dont remember the last time i have felt that sick .  i definitely dont want to go through that again . 
glad you are doing better!
i have to go out of town _comma_  i am not looking forward to flying
i feel you _comma_  but at least it should be shorter than driving and the odds of a mishap are much lower than regular transportation . 
i keep telling myself flying is safe but i am petrified of getting on that plane
i see  _comma_   i think you may consider a tylenol or some type of sleep pill for the flight  _comma_   to ensure that you don t feel uncomfortable or paranoid during travel . 
my father has been such a great father .  he is such a hard worker and loves his family so much .  he is such a great man . 
that s awesome .  i was always a daddy s boy growing up . 
awww _comma_  yeah daddy s can be the best! i wish all children could have good daddy s . 
amen .  mine was a good man .  he taught me a lot of good life lessons . 
i have a stuffed animal that my old dog used to lay by on as a pillow .  my dog is dead but i still keep that stuffed animal to remind me of him
i am sorry your dog passed away _comma_  i totally understand wanting to keep a momento to remind you of him .  was he old when he passed?
he was about    .   he was my first dog though! he was a sweetheart .   it is nice keeping something to remind me of him . 
i m glad you have something that helps keep his memory alive .  :)
i do too! 
i was hoping to get an interview for a higher position and was told i would get that at least .   however _comma_  the recruiter didnt look at internal candidates and by the time it was reported they had hired someone from the outside . 
aw what a sham! did they give any reason why they hired from the outside?
my boss said the recruiter is an idiot and just never looked at internal candidates .  it was a bummer but i figure i ll look for something else in the company soon
well that s a good attitude to have .  i don t blame you for being mad .  i would be . 
i was a little upset .   my boss and her boss were more angry than me though so i felt good they were at least on my side!
i am getting a new car this week! i can t wait to smell the new leather seats!
oh man _comma_  that is exciting! do you know what kind?
it s a beautiful      yellow jeep! the car of my dreams! so stoked!
that s awesome!! i love jeeps!  congratulations _comma_  that s great news!
a bird fell out of a tree next to my house .  i am now the mother and taking care of her .  we are developing such a beautiful relationship . 
that s so sweet .   what kind of bird is it?
i think it is a love bird .  she thinks i am the mother and it is so cool when she walks all over me and comes when i call her .  i have never had a pet bird before . 
aww _comma_  i d love to see a video of that . 
ok _comma_  i will make one for you .  :)
i met a cow the other day and i went to go pet her .  something inside me told me to get away .  later that day the owner told me to stay away from her because she is known to attack people . 
you re lucky the cow didnt hurt you . 
yes i think so .  that probably could have killed me .  but i guess it was not my time .  i angels saved me . 
good thing you listened to your gut feeling
i need to go to the grocery store but it is storming outside .  not sure if i should go or not . 
hopefully it will stop soon .  that s the worst having to get creative with the little food you have on hand . 
actually i have no food and i am starving .  maybe i should order a pizza .  but then the delivery guy will have the same problem . 
well that is what they get paid for .  just be sure to tip him well . 
i came home yesterday  _comma_   i found my sofa torn up  _comma_   let s say this i am not very  happy with my pet dog
uh oh .  i bet he knew he was in trouble .  did you get him a crate?
i was on the verge of something more serious and probably would have regret it
yeah _comma_  i m glad you didn t do anything you would regret .  i hope he is better for you in the future . 
i am so hurt that my baby goat died .  my dogs were playing to rough and killer her .  man i should have stopped it sooner .  it is all my fault .  :(
oh no! i m so sorry about that .  don t blame yourself _comma_  animals like to play with each other!
yes but i think i could have avoided it .  i am training my dogs now to stay away from the goats .  i hope it doesn t happen again . 
that sounds like a good plan .  you definitely don t want that to happen again .  sometimes bad things happen in order for us to learn and avoid it again . 
i went fishing with my   year old about a month ago . 
that sounds great _comma_  i can remeber going fishing with my dad at that age .  did your   year old have a good time?
he did!  he caught   fish all by himself . 
wow _comma_  that s impressive! i m glad he had a good time . 
my dog was stung by a bug .   his lip got huge and looked really funny but i felt terrible for him!
poor doggy! did you have to take him to the vet?
i did end up taking him in .  luckily it wasnt too serious and he was fine a couple days later .   he looked so sad with his big lip!
i bet he did _comma_  i m glad he s okay though . 
my best friend friend helped me through some rough spots with my marriage and job .  i am gland he was there for me
thats really nice you have a friend like that . that s hard to come by .  i hope everything is better for you now . 
thank you  _comma_   i do not know how i will repay him back  _comma_   i will always be in his debt
i m sure he doesn t expect it but thats a really nice thing he did . 
i feel so bad to see so many homeless people on the streets these days .  i hope i am never homeless . 
i hope you arent and i m not too! it would be rough living on the streets . 
yeah especially when it is snowing outside .  can you just imagine having to sleep outside like that  .  oh! so sad!
it would be terrible in the winter .   i cant imagine sleeping outside when its freezing
i went out to eat with my girlfriend last week .   it was an awesome atmosphere and the food was great!
that sounds fun! where did you go?
we went to a greek place .   there were belly dancers and a ton of good meats and appetizers .  i think we ll check it out again this weekend since it was so fun!
mmmmm _comma_  i love greek food! that sounds appetizing! i think i will take my girl there too this week!
as i walk through my house  _comma_   the rooms are empty  _comma_   there is no one there for me
i m so sorry you feel that way .  maybe you should talk to someone you trust .  a family member or a friend . 
that is the problem there is no one i can talk to or share with
i m sorry .  you could seek out a professional to talk to .  or you could just try meeting some new people . 
i have no children but i have a ton of animals .  i love them all so much .  they are my children . 
what kinds of pets do you have?
i have chickens        _comma_         ducks        _comma_         parrots        _comma_         cockatiels        _comma_         budgies        _comma_         peacocks        _comma_         guinea pigs        _comma_         dogs        _comma_         goats and cows .  haha 
oh wow! you did say a ton! i love animals too .  wish i lived somewhere i could have more . 
yeah _comma_  it is so much fun to live with animals .  :)
when my son was born _comma_  we knew that something was up before he came out .   it was pretty scary . 
did he have superpowers?
hah   no .   but he did have the cord wrapped around his neck twice  _comma_   and he d tied an overhand knot in it  _comma_   too . 
that s pretty impressive . 
i was in a rush this morning and i dressed my self in stained clothes .  i feel so dirty today .  :(
oh wow _comma_  are you going to be in front of anyone important?
not today .  i just feel insecure about it _comma_  like everyone is looking at me .  it is probably just all in my head . 
usually _comma_  you are the one who notices it the most .  
my cows are finally pregnant .  i can t wait for my baby calves to be born!
wow  _comma_   that must be an interesting thing to be involved with .  lots of milk too  _comma_   i presume . 
oh _comma_  yes! fresh raw milk is so wonderful and one of the best foods we can eat . 
very cool _comma_  wish i could get into something like that .  sounds fun
i miss my old pet dog _comma_  i feel so empty without her around
awww _comma_  i understand .  dogs are sooo great to be around and they are super friendly .  
i know that what makes it harder not having her around _comma_  no companionship
maybe also looking into getting a new dog  _comma_   i know it s hard  _comma_   but you can get through it! your friends and family are always there as well . 
i am so envious of those that can travel the world and get paid for it . 
that sounds like such an enjoyable life .  if only it was so easy!
yeah  _comma_   maybe in my next life i guess  _comma_   haha . 
haha _comma_  that is true .  but we have to make the most of this one .  
when i was in high school there was a senior i had a crush on and i was a sophomore .   i ended up asking her out but got rejected .  later on in college we actually became pretty good friends . 
oh man heart breaker .  thats good yall are friends though .  you never know maybe one day yall will be married
haha _comma_  i hope not . my current girlfriend would probably be a little upset! she s a nice person (the one from high school) but i dont think i could ever marry her
you dont still have any feelings at all for her?
i am learning how sew my own clothes .  i am studying hard and i think i will be able to make my first outfit!
ooh _comma_  i ve always wanted to learn how to do that .  you must be so excited!
yes _comma_  i have so many ideas! how cool it would be to not have to buy any more expensive clothes and make my own! 
omg _comma_  that would be awesome .  i might just have to learn how to do that myself . 
i just made a huge feast and now i am excited for all my guests to arrive to my baby shower!
ooo! that s exciting! congrats on your baby! i hope your guests enjoy their time .  
thank you! i have so many fun games planned and lots of great food . 
yay! that sounds like so much fun .  baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together . 
i trust the way my body feels to know if i m generally healthy or not
usually it will let you know if something is wrong .  part of how we are designed! 
exactly! the human body is interesting!
it is  _comma_   everything has to be balanced just right  _comma_   or else we feel it . 
i went to a restaurant and after i got the bill i realized that i did not have my wallet on me! the manager was yelling at me demanding me to pay before i left . 
oh no _comma_  how did you make things right with the manager .  i am sure he is just wanting to get paid .  
yes _comma_  he did want to get paid but i needed to go home and get my wallet .  he got angry with me but what could i do? i had no money with me . 
that is a tough spot to be in _comma_  maybe you could of washed dishes for him .  or give him your phone for collateral .  
i just left but i came straight back and paid .  all was fine in the end .  but i will never go to that restaurant again . 
that is good _comma_  such an embarrassing situation to be in . 
i really wanted an oculus rift .   i saved up enough and had to wait about a week before it was in stock at the store
oh man i want that too! did you get it?
i did!  it is by far the coolest thing i have ever bought!
do you use your computer?
yeah   _comma_    i have it plugged into my computer .   i cant tell you   _comma_    or even begin to explain   _comma_    how real everything feels when you use it . 
how much do they go for?
it was      _comma_  having a computer that can run it is the expensive piece
thats not bad .  i have a rx     
i had to help my dad move some heavy stuff around this past weekend . 
moving _comma_  is always such a pain .  did it go smoothly at least?
yeah .   he kept up with me pretty well . 
that s good _comma_  glad he wasn t having too tough a time . 
my neighbor dog is always barking _comma_  i can t stand it
oh man _comma_  i can t stand barking dogs .  i wish owners would do something to shut them up .  
i know the worst part is my bedroom is near the fence and the dog barks all night 
that can make it so hard to sleep at night .  
when i was a little girl my favorite childhood character was strawberry shortcake .  i miss those days smelling my little figurines that smelled like strawberries . 
aw man _comma_  childhood is full of good memories! i love the smell of strawberries .  
yeah  _comma_   i also remember having my strawberry shortcake themed birthday party .  there were strawberries everywhere! i bet you could guess what flavor the cake and ice cream were  _comma_   lol . 
haha _comma_  clearly strawberry .  sounds like you had an enjoyable childhood! 
my neighbor dog barks all day  _comma_   i like to go over there and tell him where he can put that dog at  _comma_  
your neighbor doesn t do anything about his dogs?
that is the problem   _comma_    he does nothing   _comma_    except give me his little mustache smile   _comma_    one of these days i ll wipe that smile off his face
if it were me _comma_  i d call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day   poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn t taking care of it . 
i feel so sad to see the world in the state that it is in but i am confident that times are changing and humanity is actually good . 
really depends on the person i think .  you can t have good people without bad people . 
yes that is true .  the ying and the yang .  but i think most people are good though . 
agreed!
my childhood was great .  i have mainly positive memories of it . 
you are very lucky my friend .  there are so many children out there that cannot say the same _comma_  sadly .  but so happy for you!
yeah life ends up pretty dark for tons of people .  it s slightly absurd when you think far into it!
i guess it all comes down to karma _comma_  if you believe in that stuff .  i do .  :)
i decided to try and get some projects knocked out a couple of nights ago _comma_  but needed to keep my kids occupied . 
what did you end up doing?
luckily _comma_  my wife was willing to keep them busy .   even after she had a crazy day!
it s good to have a partner .  
my wife took the kids over to her mother s one evening before i got home from work .   i thought it d be pretty nice to have a quiet house for once . 
i have a son _comma_  it s definitely nice to have some peace and quiet . 
it was for a while _comma_  but it was too quiet for me!  i ve gotten used to the noise . 
you must have been very happy when they returned home . 
i tried for a promotion at work recently .   it s been a while since i ve gotten a raise _comma_  so i worked pretty hard at it . 
did you get it?
no _comma_  they ended up giving it to someone with less experience . 
that s disappointing .  i feel sorry for you .  
i went to the casino with my brother and the only thing he could do was win! the only thing i could do was lose . 
that sounds like a bummer .  hopefully _comma_  you did not lose too much . 
nope _comma_  i m a little careful when i go out there .   it would have been nice to join in on the winning though!
yeah _comma_  but it is a good thing to hear you did not lose too much .  some people put all the money on the line . 
i interviewed for a job .   i know i gave great answers to their questions and walked away feeling like the job was mine . 
hey _comma_  that s awesome! i hope you get it .  when do you hear?
probably next week sometime .  i m really excited!
well i hope you do .  what kind of job is it?
i work in tech support .   one issue i was given the details before and got to do research before i worked with the customer .   it was great knowing what to do before it happened . 
you must have been relieved you were able to help .  did all go as plan?
yeah! i pretty much knew all the steps that i needed to do before everything started and there werent any surprise issues which was awesome . 
that s awesome! i m glad it went through without a hitch!
my girlfriend just got promoted at her job .  i am really glad for her . 
oh  _comma_   that s terrific! what a great feeling that is  _comma_   to be appreciated and valued!
i knew she could and would get the promotion _comma_  i feel like i am going to burst 
oh _comma_  i love that you are so happy for her! you sound like such a supportive and loving partner!
i have been working on potty training my dog and she has been doing great! last night though she went a ton in the house right after i brought her out . 
i also have two older puppies _comma_  training takes time and care and love . 
it definitely does!  i have one older puppy that i got through potty training .   this one is just taking a little extra time . 
puppies are smart believe it or not _comma_  use treats and don t yell or punish for their mistakes .  a change of tone and placing them outside works really well . 
i was packing up things to move from my girlfriends house and found her son s lite brite .   it reminded me of my childhood and playing with that toy . 
i remember the lite brite toy .  it was a nice toy to have . 
it really was! the toys back then seemed to have lasted a lot longer than the toys now too!
i agree _comma_  the toys now days are made cheaply and of poor quality .  everything is about video games .  
i had a move a couple weekends ago .   i was really planning on getting everything done  _comma_   or at least moved over  _comma_   in one weekend . 
moving can be stressful for sure _comma_  hopefully you had some help?
yeah _comma_  the help was great and we did end up getting everything over .   now the fun part is unpacking the boxes!
it s like christmas! only you already know whats in the boxes .  the best part about moving is you can have a fresh start on organization .  
i had a great weekend with my son _comma_  we did a ton of fun things .   at the end of the weekend his attitude changed and he didnt want to listen at all . 
that s not good!  what did you do to try to get him to listen again?
i made a deal that if he went to bed he would get tablet time the next day and if he didnt then he wouldnt get any time
i bet that worked!
my dog went number   in the middle of the night inside .   the next morning she threw up everything . it was the worst smelling pile of stuff i ve ever smelled . 
oh man _comma_  i m about to eat dinner over here! lol that s pretty gross .  my cat pukes up stuff all the time so i can kind of relate . 
sorry about that! yeah _comma_  it was a terrible thing to wake up to!
i bet _comma_  hope the dog is feeling better though . 
i used to have a boxer puppy that was so sweet and adorable .   however he had on issue that i could not stand . 
interesting _comma_  what was the issue?
well when he was during the potty training stage he would often poop on the floor .    however he would then eat it!!!!!   i could smell it but not find it anywhere .    he would come running into the living room wanting to lick you on the face with poop breath!
oh man  _comma_   that is an issue  _comma_   i hope he grows out of it
next week my vacation starts .  i am really looking forward to it
i bet you cant wait .   where are going for your vacation?
i always wanted to visit miami _comma_  i can t wait to visit the beach and take in all  the fun
miami sounds like a great place to go for a vacation .    i wish i was going with you!
one of my coworkers was outright belligerent today . 
that sucks! what were they upset about?
i don t even know!  she does that sometimes _comma_  and just badgers you .   i can t figure out what fires her up . 
it sounds like a very challenging environment to work in . 
my girlfriend is moving in .   i was pretty calm when we first started talking about it .   i m really excited but there is so much to pack up!
that s exciting! when will she be moving in?
in   weeks .   it ll come up fast  _comma_   i think thats why i m starting to get a little more nervous .   its not even her  _comma_   its just the move that will not be fun
does she live far away?
my wife and i are trying to build a house _comma_  and keep running into delays getting the permits . 
that sounds very frustrating . 
it is!  the guy at the city could care less if he helps us out . 
hopefully you ll able to get it all sorted out soon .   i m sure when it s done it ll be a beautiful house . 
i was home alone last night playing a vr game .   it took a really creepy turn that i really wasnt expecting at all . 
what happened?
it was a duck hunting game and all of a sudden the dog from the game killed my mom and started coming after me .   i dont know if you ve ever tried vr but everything feels so real .   it was pretty scary
i ve never tried vr _comma_  but just imagining that is scaring me away from it . 
a job i applied and interview for a couple of months ago offered me the job .  it was unexpected . 
congrats!  how exciting for you . 
thank you    _comma_     when they called    _comma_     i did not know who it was at first    _comma_     then it was    _comma_     wow i got the job
that s a long time to hold out hope .   i bet you were shocked . 
my husband  _comma_   i think you ve met him  _comma_   he s been having a hard time finding a job recently .  he s been in the final two candidates three times but no luck!
it always takes time .  hang in there it will all work out . 
well _comma_  he s got another interview on thursday .  i just know he will get that one!
i bet so too!  good luck to you both . 
i needed help with choosing a subject to major and my brother helped
what subject did you choose?
i chose finance and economics
nice choice .  i guess you have good relationship with your brother . 
i felt ashamed seeing the police officer yelling at the old lady
why was the officer yelling at her?
she was trying to cross the road and accidentally had her phone fall _comma_  the officer thought she was insane
wow _comma_  that s unfortunate .  i would feel embarrassed for the lady
my mother has been a caring mom since i got ill a week ago
that s so wonderful .  i love being cared for when i am ill . 
yah _comma_  i feel loved so much
it is an amazing thing to have a loving mother .  everyone should show more appreciation to their moms . 
i had to walk home from work last night after i got off late at night _comma_  it was kind of scary . 
sorry about that _comma_  you could have taken a taxi
it was a short enough walk _comma_  i just stayed aware of my surroundings and got home safe . 
good enough you got home safe
today i was looking through my childhood photos and writings _comma_  it made me a little emotional and nostalgic . 
did you have a good childhood? you must miss a lot of things . 
i think i had a good childhood .  i love that i have many photos that i ca look back on . 
yes .  nostalgia is unavoidable when we look back on our youth . 
i slept through a really important class because i was hungover and i failed because of it .  i should ve behaved better . 
that s unfortunate .  but at least you learned from the experience _comma_  right?
i sure did .  i am just embarrassed that i did that _comma_  i am not usually that way .  it was out of character for me . 
no need to feel ashamed .  we all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson . 
i had to care for my younger brother last week while he was sick .  i tried my best to make him as comfortable as possible .  
that s nice that you helped him .  i m sure he appreciated it!
he did  _comma_   he is nice and well now .  i just know how horrible it is to be sick  _comma_   it helps to have someone to care for you . 
yes  _comma_   it really does .  i am sure if you get sick  _comma_   he will remember and do the same for you!
i once got in a really bad accident on my way home from work and it really upset me
wow! were you hurt? was anyone else hurt?
luckily the only problem i had was my neck was sore for a few weeks but nobody else was hurt
that s good news at least .  i hope you are feeling better now .  and don t be hard on yourself _comma_  accidents happen . 
hi! i had a great day with my emotions with my child going to school!
oh that s great _comma_  its awesome when the kids go off to school each year . 
yes   this is m child s first year and it was pretty difficult for me to let someone take care of him instead of me .  you know how it is! parent life . 
you ll get used to it and begin to appreciate your quiet time _comma_  haha . 
yes!  i m already enjoying it!  how are you doing?
i just had a weird experience at wal mart today!
wal mart is a place where weirdness always happens .  can you tell me what happened _comma_  i m dying to know!
well _comma_  i was parked pretty close and a guy came up to ask me for gas money!  there was a gas station a small walk away though!
do you think he was panhandling you for money or a person who really needed it? did you give him money?
i didn t have any cash on me .   he got out of a vehicle that had two other guys in it . staring at me!
i m going to cut to the chase here .  just blurt it on .  my dress blew up in front of parents and children the other day when it was windy . 
that must have been a very windy day!
i wanted to run and hide .   i haven t  worn a dress since .   
i bet it will teach you . 
oh it did .   i learned my lesson . 
i felt great last year when i started going to church again
i go to church every sunday i love it . 
yeah its a great feeling getting back into church !
the people you can meet are super . 
i felt very grateful last week when an elderly women paid for my gas 
that
yeah its nice when people do kind things like this it doesn t happen very often now day
that is really not thing .  i wish more people would do such nice thing .  i know that made your day . 
when i lived on my own _comma_  i found it hard without having any company
so you don t like to be alone .  i am so sorry that affects you .  so what would you do? 
i was used to having family or friends around most of the time in my old place _comma_  but then i moved away .  i had to make new friends which i found very difficult
yes  _comma_   usually when one relocates it s hard to make new friends  _comma_   but eventually it will happen . 
i eventually made friends through work _comma_  and it is really nice when my old friends come to visit too 
that was really nice of your old friends . 
i love the gifts that i received last week on my birthday
happy birthday .  what was your favorite gift?
a pair of shoe
nice .  what brand of shoes were they?
i felt a bit sad last week when i saw an elderly man drop his wallet and a kid picked it up and didn t give it back to the man
that s terrible .  were you able to identify the kid?
yeah eventually the kid was caught i told the man and he caught him shortly after
i m glad he was able to catch him . 
i saw the movie trailer about paul walker s life today .  it made me so sad!
wow _comma_  how was it? i have never seen that trailer .  
it was just sad .  i love paul walker and his movies .  i still remember hearing about him passing away in the same way he became famous .  in a fast car . 
aww _comma_  that is so sad to hear .  he must have made some great movies! 
oh he did!  i think the one about candy cane and the truck driver was my favorite .  i can t remember the name . 
speaking of babies _comma_  i got to meet my nephews yesterday!
are they twins?!
yes!  they are so sweet .  i don t even like kids and i really felt my heart warm up to them . 
awww! twins seem like a handful but also very exciting at the same time!
the other day something happened that made me want to run and hide . 
oh _comma_  i m sorry .  what happened?
it didn t happen to me directly _comma_  but my husband passed gas while we were shopping .  everyone was staring . 
i can imagine that you did want to run and hide .  sometimes husbands get us into all kinds of situations . 
my girlfriend and i were watching a series on netflix .   she wasnt home and i ended up watching a couple episodes ahead of where we were at . 
i ve been in that situation before .  did she find out about it? 
she didnt say anything but i think she knew .   i mean _comma_  i still watched the episodes that she missed with her!
well that s all that matters .  if she was okay with it .  i m sure she was happy watching the episodes with you _comma_  even if you had already watched them .  
i moved last weekend .   i was really happy once everything was done and it went smoothly . 
that sounds like a bit of work .  are you adjusting to your place now?
yeah _comma_  unpacking and all that fun stuff now .   i really like the new place though . 
that s what s most important .  i m glad everything has gone well . 
i m not in a good mood! my husband got to go to a basketball game .  i wish i could have too!
oh _comma_  i m sorry .  why didn t you get to go with him?
i have to stay home with our son .   it is hard for us to find a baby sitter for him . 
oh _comma_  that s too bad .  i know exactly how you feel .  hopefully your husband will watch your son another night so you can go have some fun .  
i went to a friend s wedding this weekend!
was it a lot of fun?
oh gosh yes .  i wore a beautiful dress .  i felt so pretty!
that s great _comma_  but you don t have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful .  i m sure you re gorgeous no matter what you wear!
thank you! i feel like a slob lately . 
it s ok _comma_  just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice self care as a habit . 
it is nice to have a loving pet  _comma_  my dog is always there for me
what a great feeling! you must love your dog . 
i really do  _comma_   no matter what happens  _comma_   she will always be by my side
she sounds like a great companion . 
hello! i started my graduate classes today . 
are you looking forward to it?
yes .  i have all my binders ready with paper and a calendar to keep track of stuff .   i m nervous but ready!
exciting! i m sure you ll do fine . 
i hope so!  it s very different from undergraduate
i really need to change doctors!
why is that?
he keeps screwing up my prescription!  i ve needed it for a week now but they keep sending it to the wrong place or use the wrong name
wow _comma_  that s no good .  i hope they get it worked out soon . 
me too .   
i was playing a vr game home alone .   it took a really creepy turn towards the end of the game . 
i can t play those kinds of games .  too spooky for me . 
it didnt start off scary but out of nowhere everyone around me was dying and i was home alone with a killer outside the house .   it all just feels so real in vr too . 
that would keep me up at night . 
yesterday i ate a whole big bag of m&ms _comma_  i don t feel proud of myself
oh my gosh that s insane .  well _comma_  i m sure you ll be able to control your impulses in the future .  
i hope so _comma_  i was doing so well on my diet but i feel like i failed
i ve been there before too .  the important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow .  
we recently got a new puppy .  my older dog waits his turn and knows the puppy should go outside to the bathroom first . 
aww _comma_  sounds like he is teaching the puppy .  that s so sweet . 
it is pretty awesome!  i m impressed that he knows he doesnt need to be first and the puppy should have priority . 
yeah _comma_  sounds like a pretty smart pup . 
we ve been really struggling with potty training my son . 
i do understand _comma_  i have a son myself .  you just need to be patient and continue trying . 
thanks  _comma_   we are .   he did finally go    in the toilet by himself last night  _comma_   though!
that is awesome .  i am proud of him 
i went out with some friends a couple weekends ago and we met a group of girls .  one asked for my number but i told her i have a girlfriend and didnt give it out . 
gotta risk it for the biscuit
haha _comma_  i dont think i could do that to my girlfriend .   i like her too much for a random chick . 
 i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping
i have a presentation due this week _comma_  i am not looking forward to presenting it in front of others
it can be nerve wrecking .  i m sure you will do fine _comma_  though! have confidence!
i feel like i know the material but i am not sure if i can pull it off in front of others
you know they say _comma_  imagine them in their underwear . i wonder that really works .  i m not fond of public speaking either . 
i felt very bad when my boss did not approve of my work .  it just makes me more motivated to work harder . 
did you spend a lot of the time on the project?
yes _comma_  i feel like i worked really hard and i put in so many hours .  i guess it was not good enough .  :(
i wouldnt get discouraged .   maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time .   i m sure  _comma_   at least if you have a good boss  _comma_   they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better . 
thank you for your great advice my friend!
my roommate moved out and soon my girlfriend will move in but right now it is just me in the house .  i dont remember the last time i lived without any roommates . 
nice! enjoy it! i like living alone .  it is so peaceful! i get lonely somtimes but for the most part it is great!
it does feel a little lonely .   it s weird coming home and not really having someone to talk to in person . 
yeah  _comma_   but they are all just a phone call away .  keep your head up  _comma_   your girlfriend will be there soon!
i feel so happy when the sunsets are beautiful and i can take the time to watch and relax .  it is the best time of the day for me . 
oh i know _comma_  mine too! i love how all the colors change with the setting sun . 
yeah _comma_  it is such a good time to reflect and meditate on life and stop to enjoy the beauty of this world . 
it reminds you of how beautiful life is . 
man the new guys at work were slandering our boss so bad . 
wow _comma_  that s rude! he won t last long . 
i know right?  i made sure to keep my mouth shut and not add on to what they were saying or doing . 
yeah _comma_  some nerve on that guy .  he should be grateful to have a job!
my sister is having another baby! i can t wait to meet her! this will be her fourth child . 
oh wow! congrats!! how exciting!! how far along is she?
only one more month to go .  she is about the explode though! glad it is her and not me _comma_  lol . 
lol right!!! it s way too hot to be pregnant right now!
totally agree! but i will be there to fan my sister for her at least .  haha
you are so awesome!!! i wish i had  sister like you when i was pregnant . 
there was a random dog in my yard yesterday morning .   he didn t look mean but i wasn t sure i wanted to mess with him . 
i ve been in that situation before!  it can be scary
it was!  i didn t want to chase him off either .   thankfully he just kind of wandered away . 
i m glad it worked out in the end!  i wish people would be more careful with their dogs . 
i bought something from the store and the lady gave me the wrong change .  she gave me too much change actually .  i did not realize until later after i left the store . 
oh _comma_  no .  did you take it back or keep it
i have not had time to go back yet but i will for sure .  i feel bad like as if i did something wrong .  i better check my change from now on . 
the store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long .  
so i was driving down the road the other day and passed that stretch of road that has all those mimosa trees .   they were in bloom and man did they stir up some emotions . 
that sounds beautiful! what emotions did they bring out of you?
my grandmother kept those trees at our old house .   they super made me miss her and when we used to sit outside on her porch . 
i m sorry! what a lovely memory to have of her though .  it s good to still have things in your life that remind you of her . 
so i lost the ring that my best friend gave me when he moved out of country .   we had matching ones made and it s really breaking my heart . 
oh no! that s so sad .  i m so sorry _comma_  i know you must feel like crap . 
it s strange sometimes how we get so attached to material things like this .   i know i really shouldn t but it feels like a piece of me is gone . 
i understand completely .  i have things of my grandfather s that i can never replace . 
we had a pretty fun family vacation about a month ago . 
sweet! where did you go?
we went to a lake not far from here .   we had a ton of fun on the boat  .   .   .  nobody else was on the water one of the days!
that would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself! my guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days!
i work in tech support .   every once in a while a customer will want our software to do something it either cant or is not built for . 
i ve had similar experiences .   what do you end up doing?
i write up feedback for development .  it just gets frustrating when they start to demand that i fix it .   i might be good at my job but not good enough to do a code change on the fly . 
have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle?
i had to take my dog to the vet yesterday and i had full confidence they would take care of his problems .  they are so good there . 
oh no! hope all is well with your dog . 
thank you .  other than an allergic reaction and a subsequent skin infection all is well .  just a couple weeks of meds and a change in diet needed . 
good to read .  always great to find a vet you can trust .  looks like you did .  
so we went out to that new bbq place to eat the other night .   
bbq sounds so good right now! how was it?
it wasn t bad .   it wasn t earth shattering good either .   everything just weirdly seemed okay .   it was a bit strange .  
well that s kind of disappointing .  it s always a let down when you go out and it isn t is good as you were hoping . 
i really loathe meetings .   they re usually so pointless . 
i completely agree .  though _comma_  i m remote so i am never sitting in the same room as others so i can distract myself ;)
that must be nice  .   .   .  i m in person .   however _comma_  i actually had a productive meeting this morning .   how novel that was!
lol .  it kinda is .  i moved about   hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasn t changed my job any .  
oh man .   i was at the store yesterday and my nose just started bleeding like crazy!
that s terrible! what did you do?
i had to bolt out of the store!  i have never been so embarrassed .   lucky for me i had a napkin in my purse so i didn t get it everywhere . 
that s good .  i m glad your alright . 
once in kindergarten _comma_  a pair of my underwear got stuck in my shirt and fell out in the middle of the classroom . 
oh no! that s so sad .  you must ve been so upset .  
i was! i thought i was going to get in trouble
hopefully you didn t and hopefully the other kids didn t make fun of you
the other day i was looking at old pictures of a car i use to own .  i miss that car . 
what kind of car was it?
i was an old cadillac  _comma_   reason i miss it  _comma_   lot of memories of family and friends riding in it
oh i bet! my husband wants an older car when we can afford it
i just lost my pet dog .  i do not know what to do . 
oh no! i would be devastated .  did he pass _comma_  or missing?
i cannot find her anywhere  _comma_   she is missing  _comma_   it feels like i have a part of me missing 
i am so sorry .  i am sure you are .  i would be devastated if i was in your shoes .  does she have a chip? maybe someone will get her to a vet office . 
it was wonderful not having to worry about my most recent exam _comma_  knowing i was prepared . 
good job! how do you think you did on it?
i know i did well! i studied and felt very prepared when i took it . 
that is a good feeling .  time to celebrate before the grind starts all over!
i packed for a long road trip _comma_  and had everything i would need to hopefully avoid excessive stops .  
yeah i like going straight to the point too
definitely .  nothing worse than dragging out a drive because you didn t pack enough food and didn t plan bathroom breaks . 
i like when i get places earlier than expected
i had a dentist appointment yesterday .   i hate going to the dentist!
i understand that completely! did you have to get any work done?
yes i had to get a filling in my very back tooth .   the dentist said i had a very deep cavity and to raise my hand if i started to feel anything because it was very close to my nerve .    i was scared the whole time . 
that sounds scary! i always avoid going to the dentist until i absolutely have to .  i know that s pretty bad!
my son wouldnt sleep last night .   he kept yelling and wouldnt go into his room . 
oh no! i hate when that happens .  was he afraid or just didn t want to sleep?
he just didnt want to sleep .  i think he was overtired and trying to fight it at that point . 
ugh _comma_  that s the worst .  that happens a lot with my son as well .  hopefully he wasn t too cranky today!
my son graduated pre school .   it isnt much but its that next step in his school career . 
that is wonderful! you must be happy  _comma_   shows that he is getting bigger  _comma_   soon it will be college 
haha  _comma_   i hope not too soon!  i was really happy  _comma_   he is growing pretty fast!
college is when the tear will start to flow .  i love children . 
i m going to a beer dabbler this weekend .   it has been very busy the last couple weeks so i m really looking forward to drinking and relaxing this weekend . 
that will be fun .  what a great way to relax and unwind
i think so .   i m hoping the weather will be nice and we can all have a great time!
i saw the weather forecast .  we only have a   % chance of rain so you know how it is here .  we ll be good . 
i m trying to transition my dog into not sleeping in my room .   i know he wants to be by me and i can hear him whining and scratching at the door some nights
that must be hard to do _comma_  he wants to be beside you .  he is going to miss you . 
i know .   it s tough to hear but he needs to be a little more independent and sleep in his own bed too!
yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights . 
i do love my pet doggy _comma_  she is a treat to have
that is so sweet .  what is her name?
angie  _comma_   i like to give her a warm bath  _comma_   dress her in her doggy clothes and give her a doggy treat
i can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes .  i love dogs _comma_  i would like to have a dog someday . 
we just got a new puppy .   my older dog knew to let that one out first when i got home from work . 
that is very cute _comma_  the little one probably couldn t hold its bladder as long .  
definitely not .   i was surprised that he knew to let the little one go first!
that was very smart of him _comma_  maybe he remembers back to his puppy days . 
i used to have my dog in his crate when i left for work .   lately i have been letting him out more and more in the house when i ve been gone . 
that s good .  how is it going?
it s going well!  so far no accidents and he doesnt appear to have ruined anything . 
that s great news! it sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom _comma_  and was ready for it .  
i was driving down the road and i almost hit a dog! i was so close .  really scary!
i m glad you didn t hit the dog!  did he jump out at you suddenly?
yes _comma_  he came out of nowhere and i slammed on my brakes .  my tires skid across the road . 
i live out in a rural area where people don t always have control of their dogs .   sometimes those little ankle biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you ll hit them . 
i finished all the ice cream when i was told to leave some for others .  i was just so hungry!
lol _comma_  guess you were pretty hungry
yeah _comma_  now i am scared somebody will find out .  i better go buy some more before anyone gets home .  haha
yeah _comma_  might wanna go replace it
i am the happiest in my life when i am at the ocean .  there is just something so special about nature at the ocean for me . 
that sounds amazing .  what s your favorite beach to go to?
i don t really have a favorite .  they are all my favorite! but i prefer the beaches that have perfect soft sand with no rocks or anything .  like a huge swimming pool! 
those are the best .  especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches . 
i saw dubai from the airplane one day .  i never went into the city  _comma_   but wow  _comma_   it was a sight to see!
i sure it was beautiful
it looked like another planet or something .  very sci fi .  almost scary actually . 
really _comma_  i wouldve never thought that .  i have a friend who is in dubai on a teaching assignment
i found out that my neighbors eat turtle meat .  how gross!!!
yuck _comma_  how gross!!
yeah _comma_  who does that? i have three pet turtles so i better keep a good watch on them .  lol
lol right _comma_  they could easily be your neighbors dinner
i felt very sad recently when i found out that my mother has cancer 
oh my gosh _comma_  i am so sorry for your family . 
thank you  .   shes a fighter i hope she can push through 
i m sure she can with all the technology and modern medicine now .  she s got this!!
i don t have many friends and my family lives very far away .  i sometimes feel very sad . 
why do you live so far from family
it is just where i ended up in life .  you know one thing leads to another and your living a whole knew life . 
i would like a new life .  i totally understand
i heard a really loud bang in the middle of the night .  the next morning i found out that it was gun shots .  omg
what? that scary
someone was grabbed from their home and brought out to the street and was shot in the foot .  guess they wanted to teach him a lesson . 
wow _comma_  a hard lesson
my internet connection keeps breaking! how am i going to get all my work done?
i understand!  i live in the country and have the same problem . 
it always happens when there are electrical storms .  it seems to be storm season around here . 
yes .   the only company available out here is century link and they just crash randomly all the time . 
i feel very blessed that i have been able to live around the world my whole life .  now i am settled in one place for awhile . 
that is very cool .  what took you all around the world? what was your favourite place?
my father was in the military so i lived all over the world my first    years of life .  my favorite place is spain . 
what interesting stories you must have! i think that would be really neat _comma_  but settling down is probably good too .  
my guinea pig had   babies but all of them died .  i don t know why . 
that is so sad .   i hate it when pets die . 
yeah _comma_  it is terrible .  i just wish i knew why but oh well .  she will have more babies in a couple months .  
yes .   they do like to have lots of  babies
hello!
i am going on a trip to peru to visit machu picchu! i can t sleep because of the anticipation!
wow im so jealous! you lucky dog . 
i hear it is a very spiritual place to be and full of beauty and history . 
i have heard the same .  are you going with anyone else?
yes _comma_  my friends are coming with me .  :)
i want to be your friend!
i just got cable installed in my new house _comma_  i was so excited waiting for the cable guy to come!
congrats! did you do it because of football season?
i honestly do not really watch football but i most excited to catch up on some of my favorite tv shows . 
cool! whats your favoirite? i like the office . 
right now i am really enjoying mr .  robot .  i ve never seen the office but i always hear wonderful things about it . 
i have never heard of mr .  robot actually . 
life seem like it is going pretty good for me _comma_  i have no complaints . 
same here! i am glad you are doing well! :)
i am glad you are doing well also .  i like my job and i have a loving family _comma_  no complaints here . 
i hope these feelings last for you!
my dog just had a baby and i did not even know she was pregnant! what!!
a puppy!  that s so exciting!  are you going to keep it?
i am not sure yet .  i already have   dogs .  i want to because he is so cute!
i don t know that i would be able to give it up .     is a lot _comma_  but what s one more?
yeah _comma_  lol true!
my boyfriend is going out with a bunch of people i don t know tonight .  but i trust him that he will be a good boy . 
well i m sure he will be _comma_  most guys are .  i d never get to  do anything if my girlfriend didn t trust me . 
yeah .  i was in a bad relationship before with a man that was extremely untrustworthy so sometimes i get a bit crazy sometimes .  
everyone gets jealous _comma_  it when you act on unfounded stuff that is the issue . 
i get so upset when someone does not agree with what i am doing .  i am a grown women and feel i can make good choices for myself . 
yes sometimes people do stick their noses in where they do not belong
yes _comma_  it is like they don t have a life of their own and want to control others lives .  
yes .   especially men who want to mansplain things to you . 
by brother won a scratch off sticker lottery ticket! he is giving most of it to charity . 
wow!  how much did he win?
he won like     _comma_     .  he is a good man to give it all away to a good cause . 
that is awesome that he gave it away!  maybe good karma will let him win again . 
i was driving the other day and my gas tank was super low .  i thought i could make it to school in time but decided that running out of gas was the bigger problem . 
good choice .  you could have broken down and never made it to school . 
yeah so true .  the funny thing is as i was driving into the gas station my car started to stall because of having zero gas .  lol
haha! you are super lucky you are smart .  lol
very often i get very emotional when things go wrong .  i think more emotional than most people . 
everyone handles stress differently .  my anxiety gets so high i sometimes cancel my plans . 
i know it is not healthy for the body to get so stressed out but i just can t help it .  maybe i need a therapist . 
i go to a psychiatrist and take meds  _comma_   it just fixes what your body doesn t make  _comma_   or do properly .  it helps so much .  
i made a stupid mistake at work and i got fired .  what am i going to do?
oh no! it will be ok .  it seems everyone in life has to go through that at least once .  everyone gets through it!
yeah _comma_  i feel really bad though .  it is such a terrible feeling to be rejected like that . 
sometimes you need those times to make your realize how special having a job is .  gives you perspective . 
my son was very sick a few weeks ago _comma_  enough that he had to go to the hospital! i was nervous about what the doctor would have to say but had faith that he would help my son get better .  
i hope everything is fine _comma_  how did it turn out?
it turned out fine in the end .  i knew the doctor would do what he thought was best   and my son did get better!
im happy to hear that _comma_  a sick child is always a scary thing . 
i am going on a trip next month and i m really excited about it
neat .  where are you going?
we are driving to florida to visit family .  it will be a long drive but that s a part of the fun . 
sounds exciting .  have fun . 
my friend just got a new car and it s the same car i ve been wanting ever since it came out
oh wow _comma_  are you feeling super envious?
you bet i am! i told him i was driving my car whenever we go out because i don t want to see it _comma_ lol . 
ha ha _comma_  i don t blame you! hopefully you can get the car you want soon though . 
my dog has been really sick this past week but after going to the vet i truly think he will be just fine
i  m glad to here it will be fine  _comma_  but what was wrong with it?
he want really weak and had a fever .  it was because of an allergy that gave him a severe skin infection . 
i  m glad you was able to pin point the problem and i hope he stays in good health . 
at work i kept on hearing people laughing behind me  _comma_   when i got to my desk  _comma_   my coworker pointed out a postage stamp was stuck on back of my head
wow  _comma_   that s so mean of them to laugh at you! at least someone pointed it out eventually  _comma_   right? 
yeah  _comma_   but i think my boss even seen it too  _comma_   i wanted to hide under my desk
that s embarrasing .  but hey _comma_  i think the best way to get over moments like those is to just laugh at yourself! don t beat yourself up for it .  
my cousin has the perfect life _comma_  sometimes i am envious of her . 
wonderful i bet she is really content if everything is perfect .  love to hear that someone is doing well . 
i do too _comma_  i just wish i had her life at times . 
i understand but try not to be jealous .  good things will come to you to in its own time
i applied for a job promotion .  but i won t know if i got it or not until next week
the waiting must be very difficult and nerve wracking . 
i know  _comma_   im having trouble concentrating at work  _comma_   i just want to know right now
things like that make me antsy . 
after my haircut last week _comma_  i have received so many nice compliments!
a new haircut can do wonders! i always feel like a million bucks after . 
i wasn t too sure about it but all the lovely compliments really made me feel good! 
i bet you looked great! those compliments would ve made me feel good too!
i was just reminiscing with my mother about my childhood . 
oh? what specifically were you talking to her about?
my aspirations when i was younger .  we had a good laugh when i read in one of my old journals that i wanted to be a teacher when earlier that day i had stated that i couldn t imagine being a teacher now . 
haha! well  _comma_   as we mature  _comma_   we learn so much more about ourselves . 
i went to six flags once with my daughters .    i didnt want to go as i hate to ride roller coasters and am scared of heights . 
haha you are a good father .  i hope you can make it through it!
i am a mother not a father silly .   yes i made it through all right _comma_  but thought i was going to die!!   they had me ride the ferris wheel and i was crying as they were laughing at me . 
oh my gosh! i m sorry! haha thats funny .  atleast you have them a story to always remember . ;)
today before work when i went to brush my teeth _comma_  there was no toothpaste left .  my boyfriend used it all!
oh no! so what did you do?!
i was so angry _comma_  i had to leave for work very soon .  i ended up just asking a neighbor to borrow some .  i didn t have anytime to buy any before work .  i couldn t afford to be late . 
that s nice of your neighbor! your boyfriend should ve told you that there was no toothpaste earlier .  maybe there would ve been time to get some .  but at least you didn t go to work with stinky breath _comma_  right?
i once had a party when i was a teenager .   my parents were out of town . 
haha everyone has to do that once .  can you tell me a great story about the party?
sure can!   of course you cant have a party as a teen without alcohol _comma_  so needless to say we were all drunk .    we attempted to play darts .    since we were all drunk we missed the board leaving wholes all over the wall .   the house was trashed when my parents returned .   years later i feel bad about it still . 
hahaha thats funny .  i hope you guys are still on good terms .  to be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix . 
i envy my sister _comma_  she is going on vacation in paris
wow _comma_  cool .  maybe you can ask to tag along?
i will be at work _comma_  maybe next time
that s too bad .  well _comma_  at least you have something to work towards and plan as a goal for yourself . 
my litthe sister read out the speech in my graduation party
that s amazing! how old is she?
she is  
wow _comma_  that must ve been a big thing for both of you . 
i will be sitting for my nclex exam on friday
i am sorry i do not know what nclex is but i wish you good luck
its a nursing exam _comma_  thank you
o ok i hope that everything works out for you 
one time there was a stray cat hiding from a dog in my front door
wow! did you try to get it out?
yup _comma_  i adopted it and he s my pet now!
that s amazing! he probably loves you so much
i was upset at myself for sleeping in so late this morning
do you feel nice and refreshed though?
yes definitely!
i did the same thing today _comma_  so you are not alone in your behavior friend!
i dropped my ipod touch on the bathroom floor . 
oh no! did it break?
unfortunately yes .  the screen shattered and i went for over a month without music . 
oh _comma_  that really stinks .  i hope you were able to get another one . 
my guinea pig was feeling very sick but i was able to nurse her back to health . 
did you do some neat doctor stuff on it?
no _comma_  i hate giving chemical medicine to my animals .  i just kept her on a heating blanket and gave her lots of fresh veggies .  she is alright now!
oh yea that sounds like you did a good job!
after training my dog i feel confident now that he can be around others dogs without fighting . 
that is good _comma_  how long did it take before you go him to this point?
it took about a month .  i think it was quicker but i was just too nervous to bring him around others dogs to find out . 
yeah i understand _comma_  it is good that you took him there though
my next door neighbor just bought a mercedes _comma_  i wish i can have one . 
wow they must be doing well .  why dont you try to get one?
really cannot afford one   _comma_    but the neighbor can   _comma_    he is always buying expensive stuff   _comma_    last month he bought a speed boat . 
sounds wasteful to me .  life isnt about material things anyway .  
last week i had a argument with my son _comma_  he really said some mean things to me .  i thought i raised him better . 
yeah sometimes kids say things that they really dont mean in the heat of the momment
it really hurt my feelings .  i wish he would ve handled it better .  i m more disappointed in him lashing out rather than what he said . 
well maybe you guys should talk
i told him i was disappointed in his actions _comma_  but i still love him .  we all make mistakes . 
my roommate cooked some really foul smelling meat last night _comma_  i had to leave or i was going to puke . 
ugh my neighbors do that sometimes .  it s the worst! i think some things should not be allowed to be cooked unless you live alone . 
exactly! i had to air out the place for a couple hours after . 
ick .  hopefully the smell is fully gone now
i used the restroom at a nice restaurant and i had toilet paper stuck to my shoe and didn t know it until i left .  
oh that is the worst feeling! i hate using the restroom in public as is .  
yeah _comma_  i wish someone told me at least .  they all probably just laughed .  haha
maybe .   for me i just don t want to cause a stranger to be embarassed lol
i am probably one of the few people in the world that looks forward to winter coming . 
i am with you _comma_  i like it a lot more than summer personally
i can get so much work done indoor and the beauty outside is wonderful .  i love winter clothes and all the winter holidays . 
i feel that  _comma_   i hate being hot .  in the winter i can be comfy and i can always just put on a jacket if i get too cold  _comma_   but in the summer it is not that easy . 
when you took your driver s test were you nervous?
i was very nervous .  i did not know if i would pass or not . 
i took mine last summer i was nervous also .  my heat was racing the whole time .  i was so anxious!
did you pass the test?
sometimes i feel envious of those that have money than i do . 
i am the same way _comma_  i barely make anything compared to a lot of people i know
yeah  _comma_   and it seems so hard to make money these days  _comma_   at least for me .  maybe i should move to the city where there are more opportunities . 
i think cities are more expensive  _comma_   like living costs  _comma_   so i do not want to live there ether personally
yeah _comma_  you are right my friend .  :)
i believed my friend would return my cell phone to me in time
i m assuming that he she didn t return it in time .  i m sorry . 
i accidentally left it at his house and had to message him on facebook and ask him if he could drive it over
oh _comma_  i understand .  did it bring it to you at all?
i am as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow that i will get this job promotion!
that is amazing!  i m really happy for you!
thank you! i have worked so hard for so many years and finally it shows that someone paid attention .  :)
it sounds like you really deserve it!
last week i almost got into a car accident _comma_  i was terrified .  
that does sound terrifying  _comma_  are you feeling better ?
i am but i still think about how things could ve been so much different right now if i hadn t swerved just at the right moment . 
at least your ok _comma_  thank god for that
there is an upcoming promotion at my job _comma_  i am sure i m going to get it . 
nice _comma_  for what position
as a supervisor .  i feel that all of my hard work and skill has given me the inside track for this position
that s pretty great _comma_  you must really take the initiative .   good job
i have all my ingredients for my dinner party and now i am getting ready to prepare a feast!
you re much braver than me .  i would never host a dinner party .  don t feel like i m good at planning _comma_  and don t feel like i m interesting enough to talk to a bunch of different people . 
yeah  _comma_   we all have different personalities .  but you would come to a dinner party if invited  _comma_   right?
i think      _comma_       maybe      _comma_       yeah! it depends on who s there      _comma_       and if i felt comfortable with the host .  if i felt like i had enough people to kind of  rescue me  and who i could talk to at the party if i got anxious and couldn t talk to strangers      _comma_       then that d be alright .  other than that      _comma_       i just kind of do like maybe a group of        _comma_       max
i broke one of my mom s crystal figurine _comma_  i tried hard not to tell her but in the end i felt so bad i had to tell her . 
aw _comma_  that s too bad .  you did the right thing by telling her though . 
yes _comma_  she didn t even get mad .  i still felt so guilty about it though .  
maybe you could save up and purchase her a new one . 
honestly that is such a wonderful idea!
i feel happy to know that god has got my back and i don t have to worry about anything . 
i am right there with you!  god is good and wow _comma_  he s been with me through so much hardship .   i m so happy you feel the same way . 
oh yes .  he is there within all of us and he is the greatest friend we will ever have! he will never let us down .  even when we think he has we should only think it is something that i need to learn and he is so caring that he wants to teach me . 
yes _comma_  we can always count on him to know the bigger picture and have faith that he s working for our good .   hope you have a blessed day!
i miss how we all used to celebrate christmas when i was a child .  it was such a warm and cozy time .  things are really changing in this high tech modern world . 
they really have changed .  i know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time . 
yeah _comma_  so you remember all those wonderful old christmas movies and all those commercials they played in between .  i still have some videos of recordings from the    s .  
those were awesome! my favorite was the coke commercial at christmas time .  so many memories!
in july _comma_  i found a large moth inside a cottage that my brother and friends were staying at . 
oh fun!  how big was it about?  did it have neat markings on it?
it was as big as a small bird _comma_  i was super surprised .  it was furry and white all over .  i caught it with a cup and let it outside so it can live on!
i think i saw someone post a picture of those online .  maybe it was a lunar moth! what a fun experience!
my sister gave birth to a beautiful healthy baby girl last week! i was so happy to meet my niece . 
what is your nieces name?
amelia _comma_  she makes my heart so happy!
that s amazing _comma_  was it your sisters first baby?
i planted a whole bunch of flower bushes this year .  i cannot wait until next spring when my entire garden will be in bloom with so many wonderful colors and smells . 
it will be amazing!  i should do that too!
yes! i just went to the local nursery and they had so many plants to choose from .  i made sure to only choose the ones that had some kind of fragrant smell .  i am dreaming of all the flower arrangements i will make next year . 
that sounds so great!   i hope your plants grow beautifully!
thanks!! :)
after feeling depressed for days _comma_  i took the time to sit outside in the sun and have a nice chit chat with my mom . 
that sounds like the perfect remedy for feeling down .  getting out in the sun and outside the house bed is so good .   i m sorry you re struggling with depression .   i understand . 
thank you for your kind words  _comma_   it means a lot really .  and yeah the cool breeze felt so comforting  _comma_   it completely changed my mood!
i am so glad!  you know what to do to help your body and mind and that is good self care .   i try to do that as well as meditate and pray in the morning .   really refocuses me .   i m glad you re feeling better!
there may be a hurricane in my area soon i am kind of scared . 
i imagine _comma_  are you prepared for it?
not yet _comma_  but i will start preparing .  i am worried we may lose power or our house may flood . 
oh yes _comma_  last year with huracan irma we went without power for   days . 
i felt nostalgiac going through old childhood belongings
aw _comma_  did it bring back a lot of good memories for you?
yes definitely _comma_  it was great
that s awesome .  sometimes i wish i could be back in my childhood .  maybe if only for a day .  ha ha . 
i forgot to pay my credit card bill _comma_  i m so disappointed with myself . 
i am sure it ll be ok .  usually if you stay in contact with them and don t blow them off for a long time it will be ok . 
yeah but i am usually so meticulous about those things .   i hope they don t charge an overdraft fee . 
i would call them .  they usually give you some credit for that . 
i have a presentation tomorrow .  i am ready for it . 
that s good .  i assume you have studied hard and are prepared?
for the past two weeks i have bee working on it and this week i have been practicing it 
good luck! you will do great!
i once called my girlfriend s mother mom by accident . 
haha   _comma_    i m sorry but i had a little laugh at that .  it reminded me of the time i did that to my teacher in school .  i was embarrassed   _comma_    but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like it s a common thing that happens   _comma_    since they re female authority figures that you can easily mix up . 
exactly _comma_  especially since we were only dating for a few months! i felt so awkward but she just laughed it off . 
yeah   _comma_    she knew what you meant .  she probably forgot in two minutes   _comma_    while you ve thought about it for much longer .  the best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously   _comma_    which it sounds like maybe you did . 
the pigeons keep coming into the house a pooping all over the place!
that s gross _comma_  why are they coming in?
well they are actually my pet pigeons .  they are the beautiful white ones with a fan tail .  but they sometimes like to come inside to see if they can munch on anything . 
you should probably avoid feeding them if you want a clean house . 
no better i just put some screen on my windows _comma_  lol . 
oh _comma_  i am so sad that my family could not come and visit me .  i miss them all so much .  why is life so busy for everyone these days?
i sure wish it wasn t .  i live far from my family and they can t even make time for me to go to them .  so i feel for you _comma_  it is very sad . 
family should come first _comma_  right? the people of today are just becoming more isolated and lonely .  i wish everyone would wake up!
absolutely first .  especially when you don t live close . 
recently i had a very good customer service experience with my cable company .  not only did they fix the problem they gifted me free premium content for a year!
i bet it wasn t comcast! they wouldn t even give you a cup of water for free . 
that s so funny! i was so surprised too but really happy .  i might even pay for the services when my free year is up . 
i am glad you had a nice experience! its difficult to find such a company that cares about its customers!
my dog eats other animals poop .  i have seen them eat goat _comma_  duck and cow poop .  i hope they don t get sick . 
oh  _comma_   wow! that is crazy  _comma_   have you talked to the vet?
the vet says that this can be normal but to make sure that i give them their worm pills regularly .  
i thought it would be normal .  good thing to be cautious .  
last night there was a terrible thunderstorm .  i unplugged all my computers and electronics .  then there was a loud bang and i heard my electrical box make a loud click .  i think my house was electrocuted!
well it is a good thing you unplugged everything!
yeah! i learned my lesson from experience .  we get pretty crazy storms out here .  
that is a good lesson to learn early _comma_  i am glad everything turned out okay for you!
i cannot wait until the weekend is here! i m going skydiving for the first time!
that sounds amazing!  but terrifying too lol
i am not nervous yet but i for sure will be when it s time to jump out of that plane! oh  _comma_   what am i getting myself into  _comma_   lol . 
i admire you!  i don t think you ll regret getting this experience
when i was a kid i used to steal candy from the local      with my brother .  we never got caught from the store but my parents found all the wrappers hiding in our room . 
hahah that is funny .  were your parents angry?
yes _comma_  they demanded to know where we got the money to buy all that candy .  we lied and said it was from a birthday party at school .  haha
haha did they believe it?
yes _comma_  heehee . 
a friend borrowed some video games of mine
nice _comma_  what system do you play on?
xbox primarily _comma_  i m hoping he ll get everything back in one piece
i really enjoy video games as well
i cannot stand my neighbor s dog s barking _comma_  its never ending
that s the worst! have you tried talking to your neighbor?
i have  _comma_   that what makes me so mad  _comma_   he just smiles at me while i tell him and he does not do anything about it
you might try contacting the authorities _comma_  though i don t know if it would help .  
i found some of my old toys that i had passed down to my younger brother today while cleaning up his closet . 
thats awesome! its really cool to be able to keep things in the family
it really was! it brought back so many wonderful and touching memories . 
did he enjoy the toys 
he really did .  it made me happy . 
the first time my girlfriend invited me to her father s house _comma_  i was super anxious . 
yeah that can be nerve racking! how did it go?
he mostly speaks french  _comma_   and although i understand it perfectly i have trouble speaking .  in the end it went well  _comma_   and he was super easy going and made me feel like family . 
that is good! are you guys close now 
we are! every time i come over _comma_  we drink a lot of different beers together .  it s how we bond!
i spent hours reviewing notes and course content to prepare myself for a few trials that a company wanted me to go through . 
good job! do you feel pretty prepared?
i felt super prepared and i ended up getting the job just last thursday!
wowza! congrats! is it a job you can build a career out of . 
in a way yes and no .  i m teaching online  _comma_   and my major in university is education at the moment .  so it helps me in school  _comma_   and looks good on a cv for a full time teacher position in an actual school someday in the future . 
oh thats good! thanks for teaching .  :)
thank you for appreciating teachers!
my mom is one so i know how important you guys are . 
my friend is so lucky _comma_  he always seems to be winning lotteries and gambles of sorts . 
man .  i need some of that luck!
same here .  just last week  _comma_   he won over      playing slot machines  _comma_   and i really wish that could ve been me . 
wow thats awesome! i never win anything like that
i really appreciate an artists talents .  it is pretty incredible what beauty they can create!
i agree! i wish i was able to make things
it is really fun to create things _comma_  anyone can do it! but talent i think is a gift from god . 
for sure you are born with those types of talents!
i was channel surfing and ran across the old batman tv show _comma_  brought back memories . 
that is cool! i love flash backs from the past especially when it comes to television .  i sometimes watch old shows on youtube that i used to watch as a kid .  love it!
same here _comma_  i loved watching batman as a kid and could not wait to get home from school to watch it . 
i used to watch the wonder years after school .  i love watching it until this very day .  
when i was a little girl i would have to wear shoes with holes in it to school .  everyone made fun of me all the time .  my family could not afford much . 
that must have been embarrassing _comma_  i hope you weren t to traumatized
i think it is a good trauma cause to this day it keeps me working hard for my dreams so that i will never have to be in that place again . 
that is good to hear  _comma_   it was a motivation to succeed  _comma_   a great character building 
i was sad to see my favorite tree had been broken in the storm last week
aw man that sucks .  it must have been a crazy storm . 
it was pretty bad but i think the tree was already dying
how big was it?
i am very fearful of dying .  i know it will come one day _comma_  i just hope and pray it doesn t hurt so bad . 
you shouldn t think about death whilst you re alive! just live each day to the fullest .  
yes you are right but it is hard to not think about it when there is so much death going on around the world and we have to hear about it through the media . 
yes but death comes to all of us someday .  so i think its best we enjoy our life whilst we are blessed with it .  
you are right my friend! thanks!
last week i really had to rely on my friend to keep his word . 
that is a good test of friendship .   did he keep his word?
yes in the end _comma_  he showed up and help me fix my car .  i am really glad that he did . 
it is such a blessing to have good friends on whom you can depend .   
next week i find out if i got the promotion at my job .  i have my fingers crossed . 
nice! i hope you get it _comma_  i ll cross my fingers for you also! do you think you got a good chance?
i do not know  _comma_   i feel like i have done all i can to get it  _comma_   but you never know
that s all you can do  _comma_   but if you worked hard  _comma_   i m sure you will get it!
last month cleaning out the attic i found a old box of photo albums that had belonged to my mother . 
oh cool .  were there any good picture in there?
so many good pictures .  it was great reliving all of those old memories _comma_  many i had forgotten about . 
well that s nice .  i am glad they were happy memories for you .  
i just got a new haircut  _comma_   lets say this  _comma_   i do not like it . 
oh boy .   i ve gotten quite a few of those before .   new hairstylist?
no  _comma_   same style from my barber who always cuts my hair  _comma_   for some reason he did a terrible job
that s odd .   i would ve told him so and asked for my money back .  
yesterday  _comma_   i was drinking a glass of milk .  when i put the glass back down  _comma_   a fly was swimming in the milk
ohhhh _comma_  disgusting .   what did you do?
first i did not know what it was  _comma_   than i realized it was a fly  _comma_   i was about to throw up
i bet _comma_  what a terrible feeling!
i know  _comma_   flies are filthy creatures  and plus they produce maggots  _comma_   yuck
oh man _comma_  your making it even worse .   i never even thought about that .   now i want to throw up . 
i have to give a presentation on monday _comma_  i don t think i m ready
is there anything that you can do to help prepare yourself?
i think i m ready but it is the waiting  to give it  _comma_  i just want it to be over
yeah i can understand that!! id want to get it over with too .  the sooner the better
a few of my co workers said they d be absent next week
oh my _comma_  i hope that doesn t mean more workload for you . 
yeah _comma_  i hope we don t get a ton of work while they re gone
maybe you should ask for overtime pay just in case you do get more work!
i have to take a plane trip next week  _comma_   i m not looking forward to it and i have to take a plane trip next week  _comma_   i m not looking forward to it . 
yeah _comma_  flying can be scary . 
i know  _comma_   just the idea of being in a plane up in the sky  _comma_   scares the bejesus out of me
hopefully it isn t a long flight . 
i left my young daughter with my friend .  i totally trust her though _comma_  she will be a great mom someday!
thats awesome that you trust her
yeah she is a great person .   she is a little younger than me . 
its hard to find good people you can trust with your kids nowadays
one time my cat got ran over by a car
oh no! thats horrible .  were you driving?
no _comma_  it was some person driving recklessly!
oh gosh that is horrible .  i am so sorry that happened to you . 
last year during the spring _comma_  our area got record rainfall .  my basement ended up getting flooded and destroying many of my childhood things and keepsakes . 
that s the worst! because now you ll be freaking out trying to think of the things you may not even remember whether or not could have been there .  that must be an anxious feeling .  
it really is _comma_  it just sucks losing all of those things .  they were like my connection to the past . 
yeah    _comma_     i m not quite a hoarder or a packrat when it comes to those things    _comma_     but i do get sentimental with some physical objects .  if i lost them    _comma_     i d feel like it would be an itch i couldn t scratch    _comma_     because i couldn t replace what i lost .  hopefully you can work past it somehow . 
i am at peace with myself after taking a nice hot shower
oh man _comma_  thats the best feeling in the world .  getting out of a shower especially if its into clean freshly laundered sheets . 
yes! i feel like a new person!
it s such a wonderful feeling _comma_  i should take a shower soon too . 
what kind of saturday is this _comma_  i mean sure it s a relaxing one but damn i really blew it on the budget plan
how did you you go over your budget?
i spend it like maniac i am so disappointed in myself . 
i hope you can have better self control in the future . 
i really really can t wait! next week is the week! i finally get to see my love 
awww .  that is good news!
i know! i am so happy about this! and i really can t wait _comma_  we are going to go on a cable car too
how long has it been seen youve seen each other?
i am just absolutely mind boggled _comma_  i just brought the coffee   days ago! and it s already finished! what 
oh gosg .  do you have some greedy roommates or something?
just greedy? more than that _comma_  who the hell finishes a whole    g of coffee in   days !
hahahaa good point .  maybe try hiding your groceries . 
have you ever had that one person who never ever disappoints you?
yea i have
me too  _comma_   she s recently going through a lot and despite all that  _comma_   she s working hard everyday for us and i am just so happy and lucky to have her
thats great _comma_  happy for yo
ever just feel so isolated in a room and alone? what a weird day
literally me right now actually
same  _comma_   it s just such a slow day too  _comma_   but one thing that is making me hopeful is tht next week i am going to travel to see fiance
must be nice to have someone that loves you
 . i am truly utterly worthless _comma_  i couldn t even submit my work on time
what is going on with your work?
i had an assignment to submit but i didn t submit it on time _comma_  i am so disappointed in myself 
you can do better next time i believe in you!
i am so looking forward to the day we pass from this world and go to heaven
ouch .   why? 
because  i am a very faithful person and i trust in my god!
oh i see .   very interesting that your faith makes you want to die though . 
tomorrow is my first university day and i m very nervous
its not so bad _comma_  it can be intimidating but you just need to figure out the campus layout and classes but its very smooth from there
i hope i won t get lost but i m so bad with that _comma_  i always get lost .  
once you figure the way it just becomes routine
whenever you feel so hopeless   _comma_    so distance and you feel like nothing ever matters   _comma_    just remember to trust in the universe   _comma_    for it has a plan for you
you are so right _comma_  did you read that somewhere?
no _comma_  i just came up with this philosophy while facing an existential dilemma 
that is cool _comma_  have you studied any philosophy in school?
no _comma_  i study it in my free time
do you ever just feel so grateful that you re alive?
yes _comma_  i feel that every day . 
it s the most amazing feeling ever right? it feels like the universe gives us everything . 
i wish people understood how precious life really is . 
i threw my laptop the other day and i already regret it
why did you throw your laptop?
because i was very pissed off _comma_  i wasn t able to work  . 
sometimes i lose my temper like that too . 
            _comma_          final game decides it all         _comma_          final game till promotion         _comma_          time ticking         _comma_          palms sweating         _comma_          final minute and just as we are about to win it all         _comma_          to finally reach that noble masters rank         _comma_          my team mate fails to make the correct decision and we lose         _comma_          it all just crumbles to the ground like rocks falling from the sky         _comma_          my dream gone 
wow thats vivid _comma_  what game was this?
league of legends  _comma_   my other addiction  _comma_   other than my fiance 
ah yes league _comma_  love hate relationship with that game but after   years it can really still tilt me more and more
i was super late for my meeting on tuesday  _comma_  i got so embarrassed 
oh no _comma_  i hope it wasn t an important meeting . 
it was actually _comma_  and because of the traffic i couldn t make it
sorry to hear that _comma_  were they understanding about it?
my wife has been very sick recently and i am making the soup that is famous with our family recipe and she is slowly getting better
i m sorry your wife is sick .   what kind of soup is it?
it s called lentil soup and we make it a special way with cumin spice and love 
that sounds quite delicious if i must say . 
ever feel so full of emotions when looking at old pictures?
yeah .   reminds me of the good old days!  
for me it s when you get more than just nostalgia  _comma_   when you get sad  _comma_   happy and sentimental 
yeah same here .   i remember one time awhile back i took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard .    that was some good times!
i am just so scared of what is going to happen in the future      _comma_       i need to make money      _comma_       have a house      _comma_       own a car      _comma_       and other materialistic good because  i am a person of the   st century and i cannot afford any of this so i need to get a job      _comma_       but all these jobs are paying me next to nothing despite my masters degree in computer science      _comma_       what to do?
yikes _comma_  that s a tough one and i can definitely feel your pain on the job market .  i think either network your way to a higher pay job (depends on connections) or possibly go back to school to a doctorate or certain specialist degrees . 
ummm? excuse me? do you know people earn a lot from computer science  _comma_   it is not my degree for sure  _comma_   it s this corrupt world we live in that s the problem
yes but the market is quite flooded with cs degree holders .  it s hard to get something unless you are specialized i think .  unfortunately i don t see society changing any time soon . 
life is beautiful isn t it?
life is the most beautiful thing . 
are you happy with the way things are? i am enjoying every second
i live every day like it s my last . 
i hate when that happens   _comma_    i was suppose to be the on who was first   _comma_    who was suppose to go first in the line   _comma_    but instead my friend ended up going first
waiting in line is the worst . 
but it was in the line for university classes _comma_  i am so jealous 
i hope you got your classes . 
i feel like there is nothing that i can t do _comma_  i feel so powerful!  and smart! i just implemented a kmeans algorithm with my own method  
sounds like you are pretty confident in yourself!
yup i am !  so so confident and i think this is a good trait to have
i agree that it is as well .  in most situations _comma_  it can work to one s benefit . 
feelsbadman _comma_  some one in this absurd family ! who keeps on taking my bloody shoes! 
i don t understand what you are trying to tell me .  is this a joke?
no _comma_  i am angry! imagine every morning you wake and someone in your family takes your shoes because they want to make you angry
why would they want to do that?
like i said to  make me angry _comma_  they are selfish and jealous
it sure does bring back a lot of fond memories as you go for a walk past your old neighbourhood 
i can imagine the flood of emotions . 
yup   _comma_    many memories from the past   _comma_    the good   _comma_    the bad
i hope it was worth visiting . 
pen   _comma_    check   _comma_    notepad   _comma_    check! i am going to kill this social event today! i am going to leave   mins earlier too
sounds like you are prepared .  i like the confident attitude .  go get them!
i ll sure do that  _comma_   it s going to be fun too  _comma_   do you go to social events?
i would love to come with you to yours .  lol _comma_  i just invited myself . 
i don t know how to feel  _comma_   i ve been working so hard the past few months but i feel like i am not getting anywhere  _comma_   still at the same place as i was 
i completely understand .  maybe you need a vacation to recharge the batteries . 
maybe  _comma_   but i also need a plan because if i continue like this  _comma_   i won t get anywhere for reals
are you looking for a new job?
can i really do everything alone? i just feel so useless
that s not true i m sure .  do you have any friends to hang out with?
no  _comma_   i don t like people  _comma_   they make me lose more hope in the plane
i can understand .  maybe connect with some like minded people online? 
last week my friends and i ordered pizza while at their house  _comma_   after an hour of eating the pizza i pucked everywhere on his couch  _comma_   i feel so bad and grossed out
ewww that s gross!  did you help clean it up?  and what was in that pizza anyway??
god knows what was in that pizza  _comma_   but i helped clean and the mess was still showing  _comma_   but he said it wasn t a problem 
he seems like a good friend .   
 .  everything seems to be everywhere _comma_  i am just scared out of my mind of the future
the future certainly can be scary . 
are you not scared of the future?
i am curious for what the future holds . 
my mother got a big cake and left it in the fridge for us to eat later _comma_  i selfishly took it all upstairs and closed my door and ate all of it while watching anime
oh wow _comma_  the whole cake? has she found out yet? was she mad?
she hasn t yet  _comma_   we re suppose to have it later tonight  _comma_   but how disappointed she ll be when she comes back from work and sees that the cake has been entirely devoured by me .  
if you can and have time _comma_  i d try to get a quick replacement and explain to her .  maybe she ll understand . 
i created this math formula yesterday for uniquely identifying words! and i am so happy with myself
oh cool .   how does it work?
it seperates the ascii values of each character and adds them up to give a number _comma_  then it divides  them by their length and then it does something else which i will keep a secret :p
oh that s easy peasy .   sometimes i only have to wipe once when i go number   .   
i never got the chance to get promoted at work even though all my colleagues did!
oh man _comma_  i would be so jealous .  when will it be your turn? 
i am envying them .  i don t know  _comma_  i m working very hard as well . 
i think your boss should give you more recognition in that case!
i care a lot about my family and always want them to be happy
that s good!  you re awesome!  family is what is important
family should always come first .  
i agree!  
i am very ready for my first semester in university!
ready for all those ice breakers? those amazing crazy party? what are you hoping to do this year?
i am really hoping i can make some good friends _comma_  and just learn about everything i don t know a lot about you know?
yeah defiantly _comma_  my best advice to you is to learn and focus on your studying and always expand in knowledge that s the one thing we seniors always wish we had done   
i was very angry when i learned about what happened
what? what happend? why are you angry?
i m angry because my mom and my sister had a fight and they aren t talking together .  that made me very mad . 
really? was it about something very stupid?
i play guitar as a hobby but rarely play in front of other guitarists .   i only feel comfortable doing it if the people around me play worse or not at all . 
i think that s a kind of natural reaction _comma_  especially if it is just a hobby .  i would have a fear of being judged . 
exactly!  i always feel there s less chance of embarrassment if you re the best in the room . 
definitely .  i feel the same speaking foreign languages .  it s more of a self conscious thing . 
i m looking forward to next week _comma_  i m going on a holiday with my fiance!
that does sound like fun! where do you guys plan on going?
well _comma_  we are going to turkey! i ve heard some good things about that country i m very excited
that sounds like a good time .  not the usual country you see people vacation to
i have a lot of hope for the future .  i m going to get married soon _comma_  and everything is going to be amazing!
that s awesome! it s so good that you have such a positive outlook on everything . 
isn t it? i don t see negative things in life _comma_  i try to always look at the bright side . 
i think you have the perfect outlook .  i hope i can strive to maintain something like that as well . 
i am sad because my brother failed me . 
what did he do yolo?
he couldn t keep his promise with me .  he said he was going to get me pepsi max but he didn t and that made me sad . 
this is absolutely the worst! he is no man in my eyes!
my brother was sick and he puked in front of me _comma_  it smelled horrible
oh _comma_  yuck! that s gross .  did you get sick too?
i didn t _comma_  but no one was home and i had to clean that up :(
that s rough! my husband always did with the kids when he was home . 
i am moving out of this country soon and i m worried about my university _comma_  because i ll have a lot of exams to do and not gonna lie i m stressed out . 
don t be! i know this is overused but trust me   _comma_    it s not as hard as everyone else makes it to be   _comma_    if you focus and aim for your goals   _comma_    you will get it! i know you can do it!
that was very needed   _comma_   thank you so much  _comma_   i was really stressed because of it . 
don t be _comma_  i am sure your fiance will always be right next to you and help you out
global warming is terrifying me .  and i m scared people aren t even realising it . 
it really is _comma_  what can we do to help?
i don t know maybe starting by stop using all those cars ? i don t know i wish we could do something . 
that d be a good idea _comma_  we could all start biking . 
i just delivered the best project at work! 
what was the project? 
the project that i worked on was to deliver a marketing speech for healthy eating
you must be an expert on nutrition then!
i am so hopeful for the future! 
what are you looking forward too?
i am going to see my fiance who lives in adifferent country 
which country? that sounds fun _comma_  are you guys doing anything fun there?
candaa
i am travelling soon  _comma_   but i am bringing with myself a lithium ion battery for phone replacement to the airport security  _comma_   i am anticipating the security there so i may talk to the person at the desk to confirm i can take such an item
yeah .  it would be best to check the website for a list of approved items
the website says yes! but my friends say they don t know if that s accurate so i think i need to double check once i am there
yes .  hopefully all will go well
i am very happy _comma_  my best friend is getting married today
are you his best man?
well    _comma_    i consider him my brother   _comma_    i don t know if he thinks the same   _comma_    we grew up together . 
i hope he does _comma_  being the best man is an honour and you re ready for it . 
at work i ended up writing code that is able to detect words that are similar and detect their meaning and cluster them into groups of n clusters 
sounds quite interesting to code
it sure is! i used genetic algorithm as well as k means and neural netwroking
oh dang i never really dabbled that deep when i did my small share of programming
i am nervous and scared of my feelings _comma_  i feel like in the future they will hurt me
what happened?
nothing so far _comma_  but it s what migh thappen in the future
i hope all goes well so you re as happy as possible . 
i saw one of my old friends today
that s good! i hope you had a good time?
well it brought back a lot of memories _comma_  and it felt nice to see her after all those years . 
yes _comma_  it s great when you run into an old friend you haven t saw for a long time .  
so greatful to be given this wonderful life
what are you planning on doing with it?
build a life with my fiance and grow together and gain more and more knowledge 
that sounds so admirable _comma_  i d love to see you grow to an amazing person . 
in my room _comma_  alone and i am starving
why don t you go get yourself some food? or just order some?
i have _comma_  but the wait is so real you know?
oh god i get you! waiting for your food to arrive is real torture . 
i saw a cat the other day it showed up out of nowhere i got really scared . 
wow  _comma_   spooky  _comma_   what did you do next?
i just walked past it . 
that must have startled you 
 .  starving once again   _comma_    this feeling sucks   _comma_    it gets me all depressed   _comma_    nothing to eat and the delivery is   hour late
you having money problems?
yeah! but i still ordered but the food delivery isn t here yet
i don t think i ve ever had a delivery guy be that late .  i d be mad . 
my cat really got on my nerves today! she pooped in the kitchen floor and that was the first thing i saw when i woke up
oh _comma_  that stinks . literally! i have pets too so i know how you feel .  my cat will eat too much sometimes and throw up!
it s the worst right? .  really made me so so so mad
it is _comma_  i wished they could just use the toilet like we do!
i am so proud of my fiancee _comma_  she s been working extra hard . 
thats good! nothing wrong with hard work and dedication
and seeing her reaching her goals and growing so much makes me so happy . 
that does have to feel really good
i am very lucky that i live out in the country where the quality of life is so much better than living in the high stress cities
yes _comma_  where do you live?
i live in colorado with the mountains and fresh air with so many wonderful outdoor activities available . 
i love colorado .  i visit all the time . 
it is great any time of the year .  there are so many cool things to do even in the snowy winters . 
sometimes i feel very happy that i am a us resident .  when i travel to other countries everyone is so amazed that i am from the us .  they treat you very differently because they think that the us is so great _comma_  rich and free . 
yeah _comma_  we have a lot to be thankful for .   we take for granted many of the perks of being a us resident!
that is for sure! i just wish other countries were the same .  there are so many people suffering all over the world . 
i agree .  there is a lot of suffering .   i am glad people like you and i recognize that . 
i am very happy that my popsicle business is finally thriving! i have worked so hard on it for many years . 
that is great .  where are you selling your popsicle?
from my house and from a few local stores .  i am not ready to make it any bigger than that . 
i understand .  good luck . 
i was so happy to come home the other day and everything was clean and dinner was already on the table .  what did i do to deserve that?
you were probably just being you . 
no  _comma_   i think somebody wants something .  i am just waiting to hear it  _comma_   lol . 
haha! that s usually the case .  : )
i lived in new york city for a couple of years and it is definitely a place where one can feel quite alone if you don t have family or friends . 
i understand .  is your family living far from new york?
yes _comma_  a plane ride away .  but there was also a lot of cool things to see .  i think it was a good experience but it would be better with friends and family . 
it is always cool to have family and friends close by . 
when i am in nature i feel good that this world is exactly as it should be .  everything is moving along to gods plans . 
that is a great mindset to have!  you must feel very happy and content!
yes _comma_  when i am in nature .  :) but when i come to the big cities i feel like it is the devils playgrounds
why do cities make you feel that way?
because they are filled with concrete and pollution and unhappy people . 
 feel so bad _comma_  i forgot again to fill the gas tank up in the car after i used it all .  my friend is going to kill me!
oh no .  and no one really likes pumping gas .  
i just seem to forget until i get home .  oh well i will just have to give her some money again instead .  oh she is going to be angry . 
you could grab it when shes done with it and fill it up real quick for her! 
nah _comma_  i will just give her the money and endure the pain .  haha
just got back from grocery shopping _comma_  the cashier gave me back     more change than i supposed to get
did you give it back or just walk away?
i did not find out untill i got home  _comma_   the store is kind of far and i think i m going to keep it  _comma_   but it s eating on my conscious because of that
yeah _comma_  that is a hard one to deal with .   maybe you should give it back so you will not feel bad about yourself . 
i feel a little weird about looking at this house for sale .  it looks haunted and i think something bad happened there _comma_  but not sure . 
i would ask the realtor on some background and even google the address to see if any abuse headlines come from that place .  
that is a good idea .  it is such good deal and i think it would not need much money to fix it up .  but a ghost in the house is definitely a deal breaker!
kinda makes you think even more since its such a good deal that people are just like get rid of it   deff look into it! 
when bad things happen i get too emotional .  i think more than other do .  sometimes i think i am crazy . 
i m sorry to hear that . sometime you just have stop and take a deep breathe so you don t get overwhelmed . 
yeah  _comma_   i know .  but in the moment it is hard .  i guess i am just a very emotional person .  maybe i need theraoy  _comma_   lol . 
therapy is a good thing .  its is nothing to be ashamed of . 
i have faith that i will get pregnant soon .  why is it so hard? isn t that what a women s body is built to do?
maybe it isnt your body  _comma_   but also your partners! something to check into to see which end its coming from  _comma_   but none the less it will happen! 
yeah _comma_  more people are having these issues these days .  i think it may be true that someone may be poisoning us through the water and food or something! it is a scary world!
it s hard to trust anything _comma_  even the oatmeal recently was put on the news that its high in cancer causing pest spray .  
i found a lost baby duck .  the mother was no where to be found .  i brought it home and took care of it until it was big enough to be let loose again . 
thats kind of you _comma_  did everything go well when you put it back into the wild? 
the duck flew away and was never to be found again .  hopefully he was reunited somehow with his family .  i just hope so . 
sounds like it went well! 
i feel so upset when other people tell such horrible lies about other people .  some people are just cruel and are only out for themselves . 
yes _comma_  i hate those kind of people .  they have nothing to do expect lying about other people . 
yeah _comma_  it is very hurtful .  but what can one do? get back at them? it just seems like you would go to their level .  i guess it is better to just swallow it and move on . 
i just ignore them .  at some point _comma_  they stop but they understand that it is not working . 
this past week my   year old son caught strep throat .  i ended up having to miss the entire week at work to stay home with him . 
i m sorry to hear that .  i hope he is feeling better .  
he is  _comma_   i hated missing work  _comma_   but that the sort of thing a person has to do for their children . 
it is .  taking care of sick child is hard .  missing work is also hard .  the things we have to do for our children . 
my high heel broke in the cement the other morning and i had to wear them all day at work .  not a good day!
sounds like something on a movie! what a work day right _comma_  my god .  bring extras next time? lol 
yeah _comma_  from now on i will have an extra pair in my desk .  everyone was teasing me all day .  it was so annoying!
i bet they were lol atleast you can laugh about it now .  
my father continuously gambles all his earnings away even though he has two minors to support . 
that s very sad _comma_  has he considered getting help for his addiction?
nope  _comma_   he doesn t care and denies it s an issue .  when i found out  _comma_   i was too angry to look at him . 
i can certainly understand your feelings _comma_  i hope he can somehow fix his habits . 
my friends and i started playing halo online recently . 
has it been a lot of fun?
incredibly so .  it brought back so many great memories from the times we played on the xbox     . 
oh yeah i remember those old halo days too during my childhood _comma_  such a great game . 
i feel happy to just stay in and watch a movie at home on a saturday night .  i have no desire to go out and party like most people i know do . 
i understand that feeling .  it wouldn t make sense for us all to want to do the same things _comma_  especially if you ve partied before already . 
yeah _comma_  been there done that .  i don t miss those hangovers on sunday morning .  totally not worth it anymore . 
that s cool that you know what you want from life right now and that you don t feel obligated to do things just because of norms . 
last month   _comma_   finally   _comma_    after years of working towards it   _comma_    i was finally promoted into senior management at my job . 
oh that s great! does it come with a nice raise?
yes it did _comma_  and much better benefits .  seems like i finally got to the end of a very long road . 
do you kind of feel like there s no where else to go?
after working for years at a job i didn t like  _comma_   and struggling in school  _comma_   i found a new job that coincides with my major . 
i am so happy for you! all of your hard work paid off!
thanks! for the first time in a long time _comma_  the future isn t looking so dark . 
that is great accomplishment! i wish you well on your new path in life!
last week at work _comma_  i went to sit down at my desk chair and completely missed it and fell straight into the floor . 
oh my . i hope you didn t hurt yourself . 
just my pride .  my boss and a couple coworkers got a good view of me just flopping into the floor as documents and paperwork went flying . 
since you didn t hurt yourself i think i will have to laugh .  it sounds like it was funny . 
i know i should not feel like this but i feel so envious when i drive through the rich neighborhoods and i know that i will never be able to live there . 
yea _comma_  i feel the same way .   it s worse when you have to pass by them twice a day . 
i have to pass twice a day too .  oh well  _comma_   i should just be grateful for what i have now .  i just can t help that feeling from creeping in though .  maybe i will buy a lottery ticket  _comma_   lol . 
heck no .   be envious that they were lucky enough to have their parents hand down all their money to them . 
last month my wife and i ordered our first new car with a delivery time of six weeks .  
oooh _comma_  how exciting!! what kind of car did you get?
we ordered a new ford superduty pickup .  this six weeks is taking forever . 
i ll bet it is! best of luck with your new truck!
in the  th grade _comma_  a bird pooped on my back during lunchtime . 
indoors?
nah we were having a barbecue outdoors .  
in the  th grade? where is this school?
in quebec .  all schools have a budget for extra curricular activities and events .  we had a barbecue once every year in june with free food . 
makes sense .  i live in the states .  we have no money for such things . 
that sounds awful _comma_  all schools need a budget for activities for the students .  anyways i had no replacement shirt and i had to rinse it out and wear it for the rest of the day; i felt sick . 
how big a bird was this .  i dont remember anything from the  th grade . 
last month _comma_  a buddy of mine bought a scratch off ticket and won       .  i never win anything when i buy them . 
wow!! that s crazy .  i m like that though .  i never win anything either
i mean i am happy for him and all _comma_  but i wouldn t mind some found money either . 
haha right! maybe you should buy a few and see what happens .  you cant win if you don t play
our puppy wiggled out of his leash .  he ran toward the busy road and was hit by a car .  it was awful
oh god _comma_  i am so sorry .  is he okay now?
sadly _comma_  no .  he passed away at the vet a few hours later . 
i hate to hear that .  it is so hard to lose a pet .  i hope you are doing okay through this . 
coincidence  _comma_   i too i m taking a trip but a business one  _comma_   i  m not looking forward to flying
do you not fly often? it isnt too bad . 
a couple of time _comma_  but it truly scares me
well if it is a bigger plane it isnt as bad .  just bring some headphones and listen to some comforting music . 
the other day i forgot to take my anti anxiety medication . 
you have to be more careful next time _comma_  maybe you need a calendar to remind you . 
i put an alarm on my phone _comma_  i just get so busy some mornings .  at least it didn t affect me too bad until the next morning . 
i am so sorry to hear _comma_  i am glad that it didn t cause a lasting effect . 
i am feeling pretty good after my interview for a promotion at work last week .  my boss told me i nailed the interview . 
that is a fantastic feeling .  i hope you get it . 
well i have almost twice the experience as the other two candidates _comma_  so i have a really good feeling about it . 
keep riding that confidence .  it will get you places .  it sounds like you deserve it . 
the other night _comma_  drunk bicyclists were following me home and laughing on the sidewalk . 
that must have been a bit scary _comma_  you should have called the police . 
i wasn t too far from my home so i figured i could tough it out .  i was pretty scared however _comma_  especially since it was nighttime .  
you cannot be too careful these days _comma_  i am so sorry that happened to you . 
nasa released some free space posters a couple of months back . 
okay! now that is interested _comma_  i would love to see them . 
i think they have them up on their website _comma_  you should give them a look! i had them printed for a small fee and now they re up on my wall!
oh really? i will be checking it out .  i would love to have some . 
yup .  the poster files are free   _comma_    you just have to get them printed somewhere .  they have a few different themes .  i got europa   _comma_    trappist  e   _comma_    mars explorers wanted and  we need you 
free? that makes it even better _comma_  i will be getting me some posters . 
sweet! i hope you like them as much as i do!
i hope so too .  thank you so much!
yesterday i found a massive spider in my room . 
i am afraid of spiders .  i would run and scream .  what happened afterwards?
it ran off somewhere and i couldn t find it _comma_  even though i moved most of my furniture .  i m a little scared . 
i would move out of that room .  maybe you need to spray the area . 
there was a chance that it could rain on the day my best friends and i went camping . 
oh no! did it end up raining? did you take rain gear?
it barely did at night  _comma_   but for the few days we went camping it was nice weather! i m so thankful that it didn t  _comma_   because we made a lot of nice memories during our trip . 
that sounds like it was a lot of fun!
looks like we have something in common  _comma_   when i walk through my house  _comma_   the rooms are empty .  there are no one here but me
im sorry to hear that it can be hard ; 
i know _comma_  i am trying to cope but the emptiness is unbearable
yeah i would get a pet
i was watching over my girlfriend s cat while she went away on a little trip . 
that is so sweet of you .  i love cats _comma_  you must be a caring spouse . 
i like to think so  _comma_   thanks! unfortunately  _comma_   the cat wanted barely anything to do with me and i felt so isolated . 
the cat didn t like you _comma_  oh dear .  i am so sorry that happened .  you need to spend more time with the cat . 
 ever since i started taking medication for anxiety and depression _comma_  i ve been gaining weight .  
i have heard that is a common side effect but you might want to talk to your doctor about it
i have  _comma_   she said i m okay because i still have a healthy weight .  i ve been a skinny boy all my life  _comma_   and i still am but this extra chub has me feeling down . 
well you could always work out and turn it into muscle
 no matter who comes to the door _comma_  my dog barks . 
its a good guard dog then
in a way yes  _comma_   but not really .  as soon as anyone enters the house  _comma_   he turns into a huge lovable pup and wants them to pet him .  he s such a nuisance but i love him . 
what kind of dog is he
a brittany spaniel . 
i was driving down the highway when i saw a car in an accident .  it seems they hit a cow! oh my!
animal accidents can be really bad!
i felt so bad for the poor cow .  it seems no one was hurt except the cow .  :( the car was pretty damaged though . 
at least no one else was injured _comma_  but it is sad about the cow .  
my pet dog is getting older .  i know one day she won t be around anymore
just cherish the moments
i will _comma_  but just the thought of it makes me blue
it will be okay
i put in a lot of effort and energy and i found a new job!
what kind of job is it
it s an online teaching position and i feel so good about myself .  
that is a nice job i am sure
i came home drunk from the bar and stole my neighbor s package that was sitting out . 
uh oh! did you get in trouble?
no _comma_  but i felt like a jerk when i gave it to them the next day and had to explain what happened . 
that is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake .  i am sure they appreciate that . 
with all the money i ve been saving up _comma_  i should be able to purchase an oculus rift virtual reality system soon!
awesome  _comma_   congrats! i m not too familiar with the oculus rift  _comma_   is there a particular game you re eager to play?
hmm maybe robo recall _comma_  a game about fighting robots .  otherwise i have to find out what games are available!
robot games are always fun .  i bet you ll have a great time!
i went on a new bike trail the other day _comma_  it was super fun but also a little scary . 
ooh how so? were there a lot of hills and sharp turns?
yep  _comma_   exactly .  i also have a new bike so between the new route and the new bike  _comma_   i was totally terrified of wiping out .  so i took it slow . 
i see .  do you think you ll be going back on that bike trail?
absolutely! and now that i know it better  _comma_   i won t be so scared .  i m heading back out there tuesday  _comma_   can t wait!
i hope you have tons of fun and enjoy a safe trip!
i made a new friend at a convention i was volunteering at .  i was shocked . 
what kind of con was it
otakuthon      .  it s about anime _comma_  japanese culture and videogames .  i was volunteering for the msi booth (a pc gaming company) . 
that is really cool! i like in texas so i cant go to stuff like that
that s a shame .  anyways _comma_  i haven t made any friends in well over a year because i m awful in social situations . 
i participated in a ropes course with my colleagues _comma_  we had to learn how to trust each other . 
that sounds amazing!  how did everyone do?
pretty good .  the hardest part for most of us was the blind trust fall _comma_  but in the end most of us learned to put faith in each other . 
awesome!  hopefully what you guys learned in the ropes course translates over into the workplace . 
i let my little sister go into my wallet and grab my credit card so she can order something online for herself . 
why did you do tht?
she s very trustworthy and i knew she wouldn t steal from me .  it was also something she needed and didn t have the money to get it yet . 
that makes sense _comma_  you are a good older sibling!
thanks for the compliment! but she s also a great younger sibling!
 i once drank six pints of beer in a night and ended up getting very sick . 
i would imagine _comma_  that is a lot to drink!
it really is .  i felt so bad about my actions _comma_  but it hasn t stopped me from doing it at least one other time . 
i get that _comma_  well i hope you feel betternow!
i never learned how to ride a bike . 
why is that?
my parents never saw the importance i guess .  
i get that _comma_  did your friends know how to ride bikes?
they did _comma_  but i was always too scared and not confident enough in myself .  i thought i would fall and really hurt myself . 
well it is never hard to learn if you give it a shot
my girlfriend made the cutest and most touching card for my birthday . 
aww that s sweet .  did you cry?
i almost did .  it was hard holding the tears back . 
why hold them back? it okay to cry lol
my cat has terminal kidney failure .  there s no cure . 
oh _comma_  i am so sorry! i used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes . we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him .  i can relate to how you feel .  
it really sucks .  it s fairly common in cats and i sort of knew the diagnosis was coming but that doesn t make it any easier .  i m sorry to hear about your dog . 
our pets are our family . it s not easy to see them suffer . i feel for you .  and thank you about our dog . 
i received horrific news from a best friend recently . 
oh no _comma_   what happened?
they had tried to commit suicide .  it was very hard to hear but thankfully they are getting the help they need . 
that is terrible  _comma_   you must have been devastated  _comma_    i hope he find the help he she needs . 
you know at work  _comma_   one of my coworker is always singing to himself  _comma_   it bugs me
oh dear _comma_  but are you allowed to sing at work? that must be so annoying . 
it really is  _comma_   he thinks he knows how to sing  _comma_   i would not be so annoying if he knew how to sing 
he needs to just sing in the shower .  tell him to quit singing . 
one time i slipped on a banana peel
haha no way _comma_  i thought that only happens in cartoons!
yep _comma_  everyone was laughing at me
i m sorry but i probably would have _comma_  too .  hopefully you didn t get hurt though!
my neighbor was recently diagnosed with a pretty bad form of cancer . 
that is unfortunate _comma_  is he doing any chemotherapy ?
i m not entirely sure of the regimen _comma_  i didn t want to ask too many questions .  but i ve been bringing pre cooked meals over for her and her husband when i get a chance to help them out a little . 
well i hope everything works out for him!
one time i was waiting all day for the mail man to deliver my package
what were you waiting for!
i was waiting for my computer monitor!
nice!  the anticipation must have been killing you!
i ran out of laundry soap the other day _comma_  when i went to the store i grabbed a brand i hadn t used in many years . 
how well did it work out for you?
oh it worked fine _comma_  but when i pulled my laundry out it surprised me how the smell of that soap reminded me of my life all those years ago when i used it regularly .  isn t it weird how scents can do that?
wow!  that is such a great feeling!  i love when good memories come back to me!
right? i didn t expect that could happen with laundry soap!
one time i saw my husband looking at another women
o no what did you do?
i slapped him and beat up the other women
o no im not sure that was the best response
i was leaving the bar the other day with my boyfriend and tripped on the step just outside the door . 
oh no! did you get hurt?
well  _comma_   physically not so much  _comma_   just a light scrape on my knee .  but man my pride got wounded bad!
i bet that was a little embarrassing .  
i was a cigarette smoker for nearly an entire decade .  in retrospect this is slightly embarrassing .  
don t be embarrassed .  you know that you had a problem and you are better now for it
right .  not much that can be done about it now .  i enjoy having more money now though for sure!
that s understandable .  i wish you the best in staying smoke free!
being a parent so far has not been anywhere near as difficult as i expected it to be .  my daughter is awesome!
that is great to hear that things are going well for you . 
thanks that means a lot to me!
i am sure that things will continue to go smooth since you have a positive attitude about it . 
i was waiting to hear back about a potential job offer _comma_  i really wanted the job . 
how long has it been since the interview?
that s the thing  _comma_   my anxiety and excitement started the moment i first talked to the company  _comma_   it was driving me crazy .  but i ended up getting the job!
oh well congrats and good job!
my friend just won      in scratch off lottery tickets!
oh that is awesome for your friend!
oh totally .  i m happy for her but part of me was also a little envious _comma_  i hate to admit . 
yeah i can understand that .  i would feel the same . 
well good _comma_  i don t feel so bad about it then .  i thought i was being a bad friend!
i took on a challenging speed bike course recently that was above my skill level . 
that was probably not a good idea _comma_  how did it go for you?
it actually worked out amazing! i knew going into it that i d practiced a lot and had built up my skills _comma_  so i was sure i could do it even if i was a little hesitant . 
well _comma_  you never know if you can do something till you try .  i am glad you were able to do so well . 
when i was interviewing for a promotion at my job .  i did all i could to get ready for the interview .  
that can be kind of scary .  how did it go?
it went great .  i having put in all the work ahead of time to get ready _comma_  i knew exactly how to answer the questions they had for me .  
awesome _comma_  congratulations! it just goes to show how great things can happen when you re prepared . 
at my job a coworker took credit for a job i had completed .  once i found out _comma_  i went straight to my boss and got it straightened out . 
good job .   your coworker sounds like a shady little b  ch did you let him her know what s up
i found them and gave them a piece of my mind .  what kind of person does something like that . 
for real .   glad you had enough self respect to handle it _comma_  most people dont 
we went camping this summer and my boyfriend made fun of me for packing so much stuff . 
aww haha how many bags did you bring
it honestly wasn t  that  much stuff  _comma_   i packed it well .  but the joke s on him  _comma_   he felt dumb for making fun of me after we needed a bottle opener and i just so happened to pack one . 
heey there you go . sounds like you re the resourceful one
this couple just moved into my building and have been having loud parties almost every night!
that sounds awful!
yeah  _comma_   it s really irritating .  i don t mind people having fun but come on  _comma_   every single night? it s really ticking me off . 
have you tried talking to them about it?
yes _comma_  i casually mentioned condo rules on noise and asked them to at least try and keep it down on weekdays . 
an actual ice cream man came through my neighborhood! i didn t think they still exist . 
i don t think that i have seen heard one of those since the   s .  possibly the early      s at the earliest! crazy _comma_  i didn t know that they still exist either!
right? seeing the kids come running out really made me miss when i was little and got all excited about the ice cream man!
i loved that too!
i am content with my life .  i have nothing to complain about _comma_  luckily!
that is wonderful to hear _comma_  good for you .  there s way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy .  it s nice to hear someone is doing well and happy . 
agreed .  i have to actively distance myself away from the drama of reality but doing this makes me happier .  not sure if this is ideal but that s ok!
distancing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to insulate yourself from that stuff . 
i was cleaning out the attic last week _comma_  and came across a box of old photo albums and some of my childhood things .  i sat for hours just looking at old photos . 
aw _comma_  that must have brought up a lot of nostalgia for you .  
it really did .  seeing all those old faces i haven t seen for years .  it was a great experience . 
did you share it with anyone else?
i recently applied for a job with a  new company .  it would be such a step up for my family if i got it . 
nice _comma_  a step up is always such a relief .  do you feel confident you ll get the job?
some _comma_  i did well in the interview .  just trying to keep spirits up while they make their decision . 
well i hope you get it .  good luck!
i m waiting to hear about a lucrative job opportunity _comma_  it would pretty much be my dream job . 
that s great .  how long are you going to have to wait?
not sure _comma_  hopefully i hear this upcoming week .  i feel pretty good about my chances so that s making the waiting a little easier . 
i am glad you are so confident about your prospects .  i hope you hear something very soon from them . 
most of the decisions that i made as a teenager were kind of embarrassing in retrospect . 
i think we ve all been there . i ve done my fair share of dumbassery
i feel it .  most of the bad decisions were fun _comma_  at least . 
ha yolooo
i can t wait until all the trees change colors and the weather starts getting cold .  i love autumn!
i know right! i noticed leaves on the ground the other day and got all excited! is autumn your favorite season _comma_  too?
yes! my absolute favorite! it s not too cold and not too hot and there is so much beauty all around! it is soon time to get all the winter clothes out . 
i don t mind winter either but you re so right _comma_  the temperature is just right during fall . 
i worked really hard on this project for work and it totally bombed . 
awe _comma_  sorry to hear that .  i am sure you did better than you think . 
well _comma_  not really according to analytics .  i was really let down by the fact that it was a flop but i m not going to let it drag me down too much . 
that is a good attitude .  better luck next time!
the house is all cleaned and ready for my guests .  wow _comma_  i was cleaning all day!
i was doing the same thing!  hard work but so satisfying when you see the results!  who is coming to stay?
yes   _comma_    there is no better satisfaction   _comma_    in my opinion   _comma_    than a clean house .  :) my sister is visiting with her kids .  they are staying for a week here at my house .  i am sure the house is going to be trashed in the end . 
i completely agree .   mine can get trashed in    minutes flat from the kids .   ha ha .  oh  _comma_   how fun!  i hope you have a wonderful time!  yeah  _comma_   you ll probably be cleaning all over again by the end of it but its worth it . 
my neighbor sits out on his balcony butt naked sometimes . 
that sounds pretty disturbing .   have you called the cops?
no but that might be a good idea .  it s just an awkward and gross situation . 
i bet .   i wonder what he is thinking . 
i have fixed up house to the best of my ability .  i feel very certain that it will sell very quickly . 
i certainly hope so _comma_   why do you want to move?
i am moving to a smaller house with a big yard where life will be a lot easier .  less house to clean and more time outside .  :)
that sounds great _comma_  that is how i like my houses to be too . 
i feel confident that eating a fruitarian diet will give me more energy and happiness . 
hmm _comma_  don t you need fat and protein in your diet also?
i have done a lot of research and so many fruitarians are thriving and feeling the best they ever had in their life .  there is fat in avocados and avocados are considered a fruit . 
oh i hadn t even thought of avocado .  well good luck with the diet _comma_  i hope it works for you!
i wrote an email to a family member i haven t spoken to in a long time and i wasn t sure how they d take everything i said in it . 
oh wow! that is a brave thing to do! your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it .  how did it work out?
yep _comma_  it was full of emotion and a lot of things i needed to get off my chest .  i was quite nervous waiting for a response but it turns out i had nothing to worry about .  she was really glad i spoke up!
awe that is great! i am glad there was a happy ending!
i get so mad when the local kids throw eggs at the front doors of houses in my neighborhood .  it is so infuriating!
oh man i d be mad too . you should wait outside with a paintball gun 
yeah! i wish i had the time for it! i am going to buy one of the web cams and catch them in the act .  i am going to teach them a lesson! but i love the paintball idea! that is great! 
yup gotta lay down the law
i moved into this new house and was woken up with this horrible screeching noise in the middle of the night . 
terrifying! what was it?
it turned out to be the sump pump  _comma_   i guess it was old .  but yes  _comma_   it scared the daylights out of me!
oh good .  i bet!  i wouldn t have been able to go back to sleep after that!  do you have to replace the pump?
i did _comma_  yeah .  it was actually still in working condition but i couldn t stand the sound and i m a light sleeper .  no more scary noises at  am!
i made a really inappropriate joke about a coworker to some other people i work with and it got back to him . 
oops .  i hate when that happens .  did they say anything to you?
no   _comma_    but the person who told him confessed .  so i decided to be the bigger person and apologize to my coworker before things got too out of hand .  he actually wasn t that upset and appreciated that i owned up to it   _comma_    but i still felt bad for it   _comma_    mostly that i did it behind his back . 
that was really nice of you to apologize like that .  some people would have just ignored it .  i know that could have been embarrassing . 
i got my work done early on friday so i got to spend the day trying out a new bike trail on my new bike!
that sounds exciting! do you bike a lot?
i ve only recently started getting really into it .  it sounds kind of corny but getting out there on my bike makes life just really .  satisfying .  calm . 
doesn t sound corny .  we all need a hobby to relieve stress!
i miss being able to take my children to the park . 
how come you can t take them anymore?
they are all grown up .  
awww _comma_  well maybe you ll have grandchildren that you can take one day!
i studied all night for my final exam 
that s intense .  i hope you did well!
i did! i got an a and i am so proud and happy !
congratulations! that s great news .  well deserved
the neighbor s dog barked all night and kept me up _comma_  let s say i am not very happy right now
i totally understand .  the same thing happened to me last week .  i thought i was going to lose it!
i understand the dog is being a dog _comma_  but the owner does nothing about it even when i tell him about it
right _comma_  i had to end up calling the homeowners association on them
my cat somehow figured out how to open the cabinet and stole a bag of treats . 
wow that is very clever .  i would have never thought that could happen . 
right? i wasn t even mad about it _comma_  i was astounded by his ingenuity . 
that is incredible .  i wonder what else you can train him to do . 
well he also taught himself how to use a toilet so who knows!
i feel like my husband is the sweetest man in the world
that is great! hopefully he continues to be
i think he will .  he puts up with me _comma_  and sometimes i can be a pill!
lol i m sure you have to put up with him as well so its even
i was so upset when i had to put my dog down last month
oh no .  that s so sad .  was she sick for long?
not really .  she was old and we woke up one day and she could not use her back legs .  it was very sad . 
i m sorry .  at least she had a good long life . 
during my first year in grad school _comma_  my basement apartment flooded .  everything was destroyed and i had to start over fresh . 
that is awful! did you have insurance to cover everything?
thankfully  _comma_   yes!! it took several months to replace everything that i could    but even things  _comma_   so many things i just simply couldn t replace .  
yeah that is horrible .  i am sorry that happened to you .  
i am in charge of booking meeting rooms for outside companies at my job .  last week _comma_  i made a big mistake and accidentally gave a group a room for free when they should ve paid      . 
oh no! i hope you didn t get into too much trouble by doing so!
thankfully _comma_  not too much! i was simply mortified because this was one of my main responsibilities and i managed to mess that one up so badly!
to be fair _comma_  everybody makes mistakes and it s bound to happen even to the best of us!
my brother and his friends invited me to a party tonight . 
sounds like that could be fun if you like your brother and if you like parties .  do you want to go?
i just came back from it! i m actually still a little intoxicated .  i must say it was a lot of fun _comma_  we celebrated my birthday and i felt very loved and happy . 
happy birthday! i m glad you were able to have fun and be surrounded by those that love you . 
thank you so very much! i appreciate the sentiment . 
i drank a lot and told my girlfriend that i would definitely sleep with her best friend if she was down to do so . 
what was her reaction to that
she was a little sad and surprised  _comma_   but we had been talking about threesomes for a long time now so she understood .  regardless  _comma_   i felt very ashamed the next day . 
i am sure she will forgive you
she already has .  we both think of these type of things so all is good . 
my husband and i have been watching tv together each night  once the baby is asleep _comma_  of course . 
that sounds like some nice relaxing quality time
it really is! it s the only time in the day that we re guaranteed to have some time together _comma_  just us .  
have you ever passed out together watching tv?
not yet   but i m sure it ll happen at some point!
how old is your baby?
  months old   but by looking at him _comma_  you d think he was a two year old .  thanks for asking!
and how long have you been married?
my wife and i found the perfect house for sale and we excited to put a bid in on it . 
that is exciting! will it be your first house?
well it would have been _comma_  but someone got a bid in before us and it ended up being sold .  my wife was so sad . 
that is no good! hopefully yall will find a better one
i let my friend watch my dog last weekend . 
you must really trust your friend! how did that turn out?
it was good _comma_  he (the dog) seemed really happy when i got back .  he said that he let my dog out a bunch and even took him to the park!
good to hear that it went so well .  do you think you ll let your friend watch him again?
absolutely .  he has proved himself to be trustworthy when it comes to important stuff . 
i once almost ruined my husband s master s thesis presentation  something he needed to pass to get his degree . 
oh no _comma_  what did you do?
i started coughing  badly .  he and everyone else stopped to look at me and make sure i was okay .  he was so distracted after that!
don t worry _comma_  from what you said it doesn t sound like you almost ruined it .  it wasn t something on purpose at least . 
i was expecting a surprise birthday party today . 
lol that makes a lot of sense?
yeah i had a few hints .  my expectations were somewhat true; my brother s friend celebrated not only my birthday party _comma_  but two other birthdays today .  it was wonderful!
well that sounds fun!
it really was .  i was so happy!
last week while my wife were out for dinner at a restaurant _comma_  i got up to use the restroom and walked by the kitchen .  i saw a cook pick up a piece of chicken off the floor and put it back on someone s plate . 
haha caught red handed!
we proceeded to leave the restaurant   _comma_    but not after informing the manager   _comma_    very loudly   _comma_    about the incident .  
yeah _comma_  i wonder what their bathrooms are like if that s their service
i hope i do well when i start school soon _comma_  i can t help but think it will be too hard . 
don t worry about it you will do fine .  kindergarten isn t too hard .  just don t eat the glue . 
lmao .  it s actually my junior year of mech engineering . 
oh i see .  my mistake .  i was wondering how you could type and spell so well for a   year old .  well good luck in college!
thanks lol .  i wish i could type this well at   years old . 
my husband s been searching for a professional job but can t seem to land one after interviewing . 
did he try to get another diploma in this profession area?
well _comma_  he has a masters degree and graduate certificate already .  he s had a fourth interview for a position last thursday    so we are hoping this one will finally be the one!
that is a good news .  i hope he get it . 
last month my son had to have surgery to have his tonsils removed . 
surgery on my kids always scares me but i have heard that it is best to have them taken out while they are young
yeah _comma_  i was terrified .  i just wandering around the waiting room the entire time till they came and told me everything went fine .  seemed like it took days . 
i understand _comma_  when it comes to our kids and being worried about them it feels like time stand still
isn t it nice when people bring you food _comma_  when you ve had a long day?
oh for sure .  i hate having to cook and do dishes after a long hard day
exactly! my boyfriend brought me dinner the other night .  i had no groceries and just didn t feel like going out after a long stressful day .  i was so thankful . 
were at work today or doing something else?
my little sister has been going all across the country this summer _comma_  spending lots of time on money on pop concert after pop concert . 
interesting .  how do you feel about it? do you find it fun and interesting _comma_  or wish she were more responsible with her money?
mostly i m a bit frustrated that she s got so much money to blow on these concerts! and to travel all across the country!
yeah   _comma_    i can understand that .  sometimes when you re not in a position to enjoy yourself because you re busy being tied down with responsibilities   _comma_    it s easy to get mad at others .  whatever you can do to spin it positively   _comma_    i would suggest that .  being negative about it will only make everyone s lives worse . 
during this past spring during a bad storm _comma_  we had a tornado touch down in my neighbors yard . 
oh my gosh!  that had to be super scary!
it sounded like a train going by the house from the basement .  thankfully no one was hurt . 
yeah _comma_  thank god you are safe .   i don t know what i would have done if that happened to me . 
i don t like joining it when people talk about someone that s not there _comma_  just like what happened yesterday . 
yep i thinks its disrespectful and petty .  what happened? 
he was talking about my other friend who is a bit annoying sometimes .  while i may agree i just don t like talking behind someones back . 
thats good .  i am amazed by people who think its okay to do that .  
yeah i feel like not everyone is as moral as me .  but that s pretentious which is ironically amoral . 
i work at a library cataloging materials and am often asked to help my coworkers  it makes me feel like an expert _comma_  though i m not . 
sounds like your co workers respect you then
they seem to .  or  _comma_   at least  _comma_   they know whom is the right person to go to for those specific kinds of questions!
or that as well ha
when i was a young kid _comma_  i stole some comic books from the local grocery store . 
did you ever get caught?
my mother found out and made me walk them back into the store and give them to the manager .  that was a humbling experience . 
was she disappointed?
when i went into labor with my son _comma_  it was quite the ordeal .  he came before he was supposed to . 
how many month earlier he came?
it was actually only a week  but he wasn t showing signs of being physically ready was the problem .  thankfully _comma_  i d already had my bags packed for weeks so we went to the hospital ready!
is he healthy?
in the end _comma_  yes  growing too big is actually his problem now!
one time i studied all night for my final exam!
whatwas the exam for?
it was for organic chemistry
tha is really cool what was your grade
one of my coworkers has been arguing with his supervisor a lot lately . 
what are they arguing about?
everything and anything .  it s annoying   _comma_    though  he s not getting fired and is   _comma_    in fact   _comma_    getting more hours despite arguing all the time!
that s so ridiculous!

 yes   _comma_   our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast track system  .  
 shall i come in and collect it ? 
 or we can send it to you  .  but if you would like to use it at the atm   _comma_   you ll need to wait for your pin number  .  
 mmmm  .  if i come in and collect it this afternoon    _comma_    is there any way i could use it today ? petty cash is getting low    _comma_    so i need to draw some money  .  
 as long as you bring your id    _comma_    etc    _comma_    we can serve you over the counter  .  but you won t be able to use the atm until your new pin number arrives  .  
 i see  .  yes    _comma_    that s fine  .  i ll be there at around  :   pm  .  see you later    _comma_    and thanks  .  
what qualifications should a reporter have ? 
 as a reporter     _comma_     he must have acute insight and language skills  .  at the same time     _comma_     he must have good judgment     _comma_     the respect for his job and tactical cooperation with others  .  
 can you work under pressure ? you know   _comma_   people working here are all busy everyday since we re daily newspaper  .  
 i think i ve got used to work under pressure  .  i will adjust myself to the step of your newspaper quickly  .  
hi    _comma_    good morning    _comma_    miss ? what can i help you with ? 
 good morning i d like to mail this box of books to taiwan  .  
 ok   _comma_   please put it on this scale . airmail or by sea ? 
 how long does it take to reach taiwan by sea ? 
 usually about two month  .  
 that s too long . how long does it take to reach taiwan by airmail ? 
 about ten days  .  
 then how much is that by airmail ? 
 let me see . it   s    dollars    _comma_       cents    _comma_    including tax  .  
 that s a little bit expensive  .  
 although it s expensive to send it by airmail   _comma_   it s quicker and safer than by sea  .  
 i guess i have to send it by airmail  .  
 do you want to ensure the contents   _comma_   miss ? 
 yes   _comma_   please  .  
 please fill out this form   _comma_   also please write the value of the items in this space  .

 do you mean that i go that way for one block   _comma_   then turn right ? 
 yes   _comma_   you are right  .

 but i saw a red car always parking here before  .  
 oh   _comma_   we ve just repainted our car  .  it was red  .

hello    _comma_    sir  .  you re here to discuss the network settlement service    _comma_    right ? 
 yes   _comma_   that s right  .  we want as much info as possible before we agree to anything  .  
 yes      _comma_      it s important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement  .  to make full use of the network settlement service and take advantage of the whole banking system      _comma_      we provide internal fund transfers      _comma_      account inquiry      _comma_      agency clearing to name but a few  .  
 so   _comma_   do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ? 
 yes   _comma_   and it s extremely simple  .  all you need to do is make a network settlement agreement with us  .  
dear    _comma_    time is up    _comma_    let ’ s go there now  .  
 just a minute  .  i ’ m putting on my clothes  .  
 have you taken the key to the door ? 
 yes  .  oh    _comma_    dear    _comma_    i can ’ t find my hairbrushes  .  can you help me ? 
 where have you put it ? 
 i put it in the dressing room  .

 yes   _comma_   quite sure  .

 yes   _comma_   i ’ ve looked everywhere downstairs  .

 i am just waiting for my friends  .  it won t be long  .  
 sir   _comma_   the curb here is not for parking  .  
 but i didn t see the sign   _comma_   ma ’ am  .  
 there is a sign at the corner of the street  .  when you turned in here   _comma_   you should have seen it  .  
 i didn t see it  .  
 i am sorry   _comma_   sir  .  i have to give you a ticket  .  you can appeal to the court within    days  .  you will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault  .  
are you a goal oriented person ? 
 yes   _comma_   i am  .  i always make a plan before i do anything  .  
 where do you want to be in   years ? 
 i don t want to have a specific title  .  i just want to enjoy what i am doing  .  
 that sounds very reasonable  .  
 it s the most important thing to me  .  
 if you are hired   _comma_   how long do you plan to stay with us ? 
 that obviously depends on how things go     whether i m suited to the firm and the firm to me  .  
 tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them  .  
 i want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position  .  in order to achieve this goal   _comma_   i just want to work step by step  .  
 what is your long range objective ? 
 i haven t thought it over at all  .  
 what do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ? 
 i think the most important thing is the interest in the job  .  
i d like to open a current account  .  
 certainly  .  may i see your social security and your id   _comma_   please  .  
 here you are  .  i wonder how much interest can i earn from a current account  .  
 oh   _comma_   current accounts don t pay out interest  .  
 why is that ? 
 it s primarily designed for business transactions  .  that is    _comma_    writing checks to pay for bills    _comma_    buying things and sending money  .  we won t expect a large amount of deposit in a current account  .  
 i see  .  how do i draw money for my own use then ? 
good morning   _comma_   helen  .  
 good morning   _comma_   steven  .  
 so   _comma_   what s the status of our advertising campaign ? 
 it ll be a national campaign starting next week  .  
 what style will the ads be ? 
 i suggest that we focus on slice of life   _comma_   showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice cream sandwich  .  
 sounds like a good idea  .  will we have a new slogan ? 
 definitely  .  
i d like to taste some local dishes  .  what would you recommend ? 
 that s fine  .  you must try this dish  .  
 could you tell me how this thing is cooked ? 
 it s fish steamed and served with our special sauce  .  
 is it good ? 
 sure  .  it s a most popular dish  .  
 i think i ll try it   _comma_   and give me some green salad together  .  
 we have two dressings for salad  .  which one would you like ? 
 what kind do you have ? 
 we have french and thousand island  .  
 make it thousand island  .  
taxi !

 friendship hotel  .

hi   _comma_   mark  .  
 hi   _comma_   bill  .  i ’ d like to take the apartment i looked at yesterday  .  
 all right  .  
 so   _comma_   what do we do now ? 
 this is the lease  .  you should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant  .  the lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords  .  
 okay  .  ( reads the lease ) so     _comma_     according to the lease     _comma_     i ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit     _comma_     and i have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance  .  i understand that i ’ ll get the security deposit back when i move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs  .  
 yes  .  if you do not damage the apartment   _comma_   you will get your security deposit back when you move out  .  
 can i pay you by check ? 
 sure  .  a check will be fine  .  
 is there a laundry room in the basement ? 
 yes  .  
 can i sign the lease right now ? 
good morning ! what can i do for you ? 
 i m thinking of travelling to suzhou in july  .  could you recommend some tourist programs for that ? 
 with pleasure  .  we arrange two kinds of tourist programs for suzhou   _comma_   a six day tour by train and a five day flying journey  .  
 how much does a six day tour by train cost ? 
 five hundred yuan  .  
 does that include hotels and meals ? 
 oh    _comma_    yes    _comma_    and admission tickets for places of interest as well  .  
 that sounds reasonable  .  what about the five day flying journey ? how much is that ? 
 eight hundred and fifty yuan  .  
 covering all expenses ? 
 yes  .  but there is no half fare for children  .  they must pay full fare  .  
i can t believe you wear jeans to the office ! are you trying to lose your job ? 
 of course not  .  i m just observing casual day  .  on fridays   _comma_   the company doesn t require us to wear formal business attire  .  
 wow ! nobody told me about that  .  won t the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? 
 we don t think so  .  casual days are becoming more common   _comma_   and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes  .  
 i guess it lets people express their individual tastes  .  but won t some people abuse it ? 
 not really  .  besides   _comma_   there is a separate dress code for casual day  .  people can t just wear whatever they want  .  
 it seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity  .  
 believe it or not   _comma_   it has the opposite effect  .  employees are actually more productive on casual days  .

 then   _comma_   what s your usual commission rate for your agents ? 
 usually   _comma_   we give a commission of   % to our agents  .  
   % is too low         _comma_         i think  .  you see         _comma_         we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion         _comma_         such as advertising on radio or tv         _comma_         printing booklets         _comma_         leaflets         _comma_         catalogues and so on  .  it all costs money         _comma_           % is not enough  .  
 don t worry  .  we ll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase  .  
 you mean to saya 
 it sounds ok  .  then how do you pay the commission ? 
 we may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment  .  
 all right  .  if it s okay   _comma_   we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately  .  
 think it over  .  we hope to keep a good business relationship with you  .  
 thank you for your help  .

 what s going on ? 
 look  .  two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other  .  that s why that car stops  .  
 more and more people easily get irritated while driving  .  
 yes  .  this is what is called road rage  .  
this is today ’ s schedule  .  at   thirty am    _comma_    conference with the department managers  .  at   o ’ clock    _comma_    live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the staff for preventatives  .  
 that ’ s great  .  what are the prizes ? 
      rib as bonus for each person  .  
 to encourage the staff increases  .  
 ok  .  next thing is laying the corner stone for the new plant at    am  .  at    am   _comma_   back here for lunch  .  
 what about the afternoon ?

this is lincoln bank   _comma_   consumer credit department  .  how can i help you ? 
 ah   _comma_   hello  .  i m calling to find out how i apply for a car loan  .  
 we offer a personal automobile consumer loan  .  the application process is pretty straight forward  .  i trust you have enough funds to cover the    % down payment ? 
 yes   _comma_   i do  .  it s ready and waiting in my account  .  
 the next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you    _comma_    who are already contracted to us    _comma_    so  .  
 could i just stop you there ? sorry to interrupt   _comma_   but i have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car i want  .  
 that will certainly cut down the processing time  .  we can move on to the next step  .  do you have the purchase price ? 
 yes       _comma_       it s          _comma_          rib  .  so       _comma_       with the down payment done       _comma_       i will need to borrow         _comma_          rib  .  
 what we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form      _comma_      id card      _comma_      proof of residency      _comma_      proof of income      _comma_      the agreement from the agent and of course the    % down payment  .  
 yes    _comma_    i have everything here  .  ok    _comma_    i ll come in and see you later today  .  maybe i could have my new car as early as next week ! how exciting ! 
hi   _comma_   my name is tom  .  
 tom   _comma_   the new sales representative ? nice to meet you ! i m melinda  .  
 nice to meet you too . melinda  .  
 now let me show you around  .  this is our reception area   _comma_   and our conference room is right over there  .  over here is the sales department  .  
 really ? this is a nice office   _comma_   but it s quite small  .  
 yeah  .  you can make photocopies and send faxes over there  .  
 it looks like you guys work hard  .  
 i tell you what just between you and me    _comma_    we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard . just kidding  .  oh    _comma_    your cubicle is over the  .  and this way  .  those are all private offices the managers offices  .  
 hmm  .  tell me more details about our jobs  .  
 sure thing  .  
what do you think of our price ? 
 your price has gone up sharply   _comma_   hasn t it ? 
 yes  .  we regret we cannot maintain our original price  .  since the prices of the raw materials have been raised   _comma_   we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly  .  
 i agree with you there   _comma_   but your price is unreasonable  .  
 i don t think so  .  you must compare our price with that of other export houses  .  i m sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level  .  
 i don t think we ll be able to pay the price  .  to have this business concluded   _comma_   you need to lower your price at least by   %  .  
 i ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price  .  
 don t you agree with me that in the long run   _comma_   moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? 
 we ve already cut down our price to cost level  .  
 is that all ? 
 yes   _comma_   this is the best we can do  .  
 i m sorry we can t handle the price you offered  .  
so    _comma_    jimmy    _comma_    how does it feel to have your own money ? 
 it ’ s great    _comma_    dad  .  i don ’ t mind delivering papers    _comma_    but the real fun is collecting the money  .  
 even though you are only twelve   _comma_   it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money  .  
 i ’ ve never had a bank account before  .  why don ’ t i just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? 
 you know you would spend it  .  and also   _comma_   money in the bank earns interest  .  
 but what if i need my money suddenly ? 
 the bank will give you a pin   _comma_   and you can withdraw money from any atm  .  
 great ! so it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! 
 not quite  .  you have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars  .  and sometimes the bank has service charges  .  but you don ’ t have to worry about that yet  .  let ’ s go make your first depot 
 ok  .  guess i have to do that before  .  i can make money my first withdrawal  .  
is this where i can catch a bus to the theater ? 
 yes   _comma_   but you can t get there with out a change  .  
 which bus do i have to change ? 
 you have to get off at the hospital and change for bus     .  
 i see  .  thank you  .  
here we are    _comma_    joan  .  this is the palace museum    _comma_    also known as the forbidden city  .  
 oh   _comma_   how splendid ! can you take a picture of me here ? 
 sure  .  
excuse me  .  i m afraid i got lost  .  where am i on this map ? 
 we are here    _comma_    bus station    _comma_    we are in the heart of the city  .  
 oh ! can i go from here to the zhongshan park ? 
 head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right  .  
tony   _comma_   could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ? 
 working hours are from  :    a  .  m  .  to  :   p  .  m  .  be sure not to be late or absent  .  report to the manager by filling in the   monthly report   every month  .  
 is there anything else ? how about my salary ? 
 our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard  .  on the   th day of every month   _comma_   you can get your salary on time  .  benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee s past attendance record  .  
 wow      _comma_      thank you for telling me these  .  do you mind telling me something else      _comma_      like attendance record      _comma_      holiday      _comma_      and how to ask for leave ? 
 all new members are likely to ask the same questions  .  haha  .  i can understand that  .  every month you have three days off     _comma_     besides the weekends and some important holidays  .  after you ve been here for a year     _comma_     you qualify for a one week vacation  .  the leave less than a half day should predict for an hour     _comma_     and more than a half day should predict three days  .  
 okay   _comma_   that s good  .  i get it  .  
kate   _comma_   you never believe what s happened  .  
 what do you mean ? 
 masha and hero are getting divorced  .  
 you are kidding  .  what happened ? 
 well     _comma_     i don t really know     _comma_     but i heard that they are having a separation for   months     _comma_     and filed for divorce  .  
 that s really surprising  .  i always thought they are well matched  .  what about the kids ? who get custody ? 
 masha    _comma_    it seems quiet and makable    _comma_    no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out  .  
 that s the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about  .  well     _comma_     i still can t believe it     _comma_     masha and hero     _comma_     the perfect couple  .  when would they divorce be final ? 
 early in the new year i guess  .  
overseas operator  .  
 i would like to make a collect call to taipei    _comma_    taiwan    _comma_    please  .  
 your name   _comma_   please  .  
 tim chen  .

hello  .  excuse me  .  
 yes  .  can i help you ? 
 do you remember me ? i just had lunch here a half hour ago  .  
 of course i remember you  .  
 i think i lost my wallet here  .  
 oh   _comma_   no  .  really ? i didn t see anything  .  
 really ? you didn t find a wallet ? 
 no   _comma_   i didn t  .  would you like to go look by the table with me ? 
 yes   _comma_   i would  .  it s not here  .  and it s not on the floor . has anyone sat at this table since we left ? 
 no  .  it s been empty the whole time  .  
 hmm  .  i don t know how it could have happened  .  
 i remember     _comma_     sir     _comma_     that your friend took the bill . you didn t pay for the lunch yourself     _comma_     did you ? 
 no  .  my friend did  .  
 then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? 
 no   _comma_   i m not sure  .  but i usually take out my wallet when i sit down . it   s uncomfortable to sit on it  .  so i usually put it next to me on the table  .  
 maybe you lost it before you came here  .  or maybe you left it at home  .  
 i don t think it s at home  .  i think i had it when i left the house . but what should i do ? 
 well        _comma_        the first thing you should do is make sure it s not at home . then        _comma_        if it isn t        _comma_        you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards  .  next        _comma_        you need to replace whatever you lost        _comma_        your driver s license        _comma_        things like that  .  
 should i call the police ? 
 you can if you want  .  but the police usually don t do anything about lost wallets  .  
 hmm  .  i ll go home and check  .  maybe you re right  .  maybe it s at home  .  
 i m sorry we couldn t find it   _comma_   sir  .  
 thanks for your help  .

just as the saying goes   _comma_   every potter praises his own pot  .  you should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview  .  
 it is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time  .  
 you d better prepare what you are going to say in advance   _comma_   in order to have a good performance in the interview  .  
 the contents should be mainly descriptions of your background  .  and the length depends on the particular situation  .  
 only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in   _comma_   can you make a targeted preparation  .  
 to sell yourself successfully   _comma_   you should leave the interviewer a deep impression  .  
 selling yourself should go straight to the point   _comma_   and the statement should be clear and brief  .  
 it should also be truthful and realistic  .  do not blindly blow your own horn  .  
 you should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for  .  
 while you should not omit your weak points   _comma_   they need to be described appropriately 
 time permitted   _comma_   you could add certain examples to your description  .  
 besides    _comma_    in the interview    _comma_    it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly  .

 some people are wildly shooting on the next street  .  we must leave here as soon as possible !

 yes   _comma_   of course  .  the delay is due to heavy rain  .  
 how long will the delay be ? do you have any further information about it ?

what are we going to do ? i can t get the car out of this ditch  .  i m stuck ! 
 i m worried   _comma_   tom  .  i haven t seen any other cars for almost an hour  .  
 i know  .  this is terrible  .  what can we do ? this snow doesn t stop falling ! 
 i told you we should have stayed in town today . the weather report said     percent chance of snow . why did you want to come up here ? 
 i wanted to show you the cabin  .  we only had another half hour to go  .  
 well   _comma_   now we re stuck  .  what can we do ? 
 i don t know  .  
 i ve heard that when this happens   _comma_   it s important to save energy  .  
 what do you mean ? 
 we re stranded here   _comma_   tom  .  we may be here a long time . we need to conserve the gas in the car  .  the car s energy is what will keep us warm  .  
 i have plenty of gas  .  
 yes    _comma_    but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . we can t just let the car run and run . if we do    _comma_    it will die soon  .  then we ll freeze  .  
 so what can we do ? 
 turn the lights off . then   _comma_   run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . that will conserve the heat as long as possible  .  
 alright  .  that s a good idea  .  
 i wish we hadn t come up here  .  now we ll probably be here for days  .  
 days ? 
 yes   _comma_   it happens . that is what happens in big snowstorms  .  people get stranded for days  .  
 oh   _comma_   my god ! it s good we have food  .  
 probably we ll survive . but turn the car off for about forty five minutes  .  then we ll turn it on again  .  
hey    _comma_    buddy    _comma_    can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ? 
 oh   _comma_   sorry  .  i didn ’ t know  .

 no   _comma_   i ’ m afraid not  .  
 well    _comma_    you have to wait in line like everyone else  .  besides    _comma_    you should let old people on first  .  
 sorry  .

 that sounds good     _comma_     thanks     _comma_     i d like that  .  actually i d like sprite instead of coke     _comma_     thanks  .  
 that s not a problem   _comma_   miss  .  will that be it ? 
 yes   _comma_   that s all  .  
 that will be   rmb   _comma_   please

 yes   _comma_   it is  .  
 that s fine  .  let s get on the bus  .  
i am sure we will make it up as soon as possible  .  
 that s nice  .  
 we hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings  .  
 of course not  .  we have cooperated for a long time  .  
i would like to purchase some meat  .  
 what kind of meat would you like to get today ? 
 first off   _comma_   i m going to need a pound of ground beef  .  
 a pound of ground beef is     .     .  
 that s perfect  .  
 what else will you be needing ? 
 i m also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts  .  
 the chicken breasts cost     .    per pound  .  
 what s the total price for the chicken ? 
 it s going to be      .     .  
 okay   _comma_   i think that will be all for me today  .  
i think you know already that i want to discuss the represent   ton for your alarm clocks  .  
 yes    _comma_    mr  .  bergeron  .  you mentioned that in your letter  .  to tell you the truth    _comma_    your proposal surprised us  .  
 is that so ? anyhow i want to go over the details with you in person     _comma_     so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration  .  our firm specializes in this line of business  .  we have six sales representatives     _comma_     who are on the road all the time     _comma_     covering the whole of the european market  .  
 do you sell direct to shops ? 
 yes    _comma_    we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts  .  we have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct    _comma_    without any middlemen  .  
 do you keep a stock of these things ? 
 in some cases        _comma_        such as the wristwatches        _comma_        which always have a steady market        _comma_        we keep a stock in london and act as distributors as well as agents  .  generally        _comma_        however        _comma_        we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply  .  we are paid for our service        _comma_        of course  .  
 that is   _comma_   your commission  .  
 yes   _comma_   our commission is very reasonable  .  we usually get a    % commission of the amount on every deal  .  
 our agents in other areas usually get a     % commission  .  
 the european market is not familiar with your products  .  you have competitors from japan and other continental countries  .  at the beginning of our campaign    _comma_    there is sales resistance to overcome    _comma_    we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news   papers and tv programs  .  a    % commission will not leave us much  .  
 according to your estimate     _comma_     what is the maximum annual turn   over you can fulfill     _comma_     in round figures     _comma_     of course ? 
 we will always do our utmost to enlarge the business     _comma_     as our remuneration increases with the turnover     _comma_     but we will not guar   ante anything     _comma_     at least not to begin with  .  
 we appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products  .  but our suggestion to you     _comma_     mr  .  bergeron     _comma_     as a preliminary step     _comma_     is to do a little research into the market  .  
 do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? 
 mr  .  bergeron   _comma_   you leave us no alternative  .  we can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole european market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover  .  besides our price is worked out according to the costing  .  a    % commission means an increase in our price  .  we must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect  .  
 oh   _comma_   that s just too bad  .  i intended to make great efforts in selling your products  .  
 well      _comma_      we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement  .  to start the ball rolling      _comma_      we will provide you with price lists      _comma_      catalogues and some samples  .  only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products      _comma_      can we then discuss further details  .  
 ah    _comma_    mrs  .  miller    _comma_    but in this case am i covered ? 
 oh   _comma_   yes  .  we will give you a   % commission on every transaction  .  
 all right   _comma_   but i ll be back again for the autumn fair  .  and then i hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency  .  
 very good  .  we will discuss the matter again at the next fair  .  
excuse me    _comma_    i ’ m sorry to trouble you  .  my name is susan ransom    _comma_    and i have placed several orders with you company  .  
 yes   _comma_   mr  .  ransom ? this is karl miller  .  how may i help you ? 
 well   _comma_   i wonder if you could track an order i placed with you last month  .  it hasn ’ t arrived yet  .  
 certainly   _comma_   ms  .  ransom  .  do you have an order number ? 
have you worked out the offers  .  mr  .  thou ? 
 yes   _comma_   we have  .  here s our cif quotation sheet  .  please have a careful look  .  
 are the prices on the list firm offers ? 
 yes  .  all the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation  .  
 i wonder whether there are any changes in your prices  .  
 all these products are our best selling lines  .  the prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand  .  and we are always open to negotiate   _comma_   especially on larger orders  .  what do you have in mind ? 
 how long does your offer remain valid ? i need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan  .  
 i understand  .  our offer remains open for   days  .  
hello sir   _comma_   may i help you ? 
 yeah   _comma_   i accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet  .  
 i see  .  well   _comma_   you have come to the right place  .  we have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers  .  
 sounds good  .  i don ’ t want it to be too expensive   _comma_   maybe something mid range  .  
 we have this new etc smart phone . it comes with the android os so you can download applications  .  it also has a built in camera   _comma_   mp  player and touch screen  .  it works on the  g network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are  .  
 what about wi fi ? 
 of course ! you can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home  .  
 one last thing  .  is it waterproof ? 
we have been over this a hundred times ! we are not getting a pet ! 
 why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy or a kitty ! 
 who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? 
 i will ! i ’ ll feed it   _comma_   bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a labrador or a german shepard ! 
 what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus   _comma_   our apartment is too small for that breed of dog  .  
 ok  .  how about we get a cat or a ferret ? 
 we ’ re planning on having children soon   _comma_   i don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house  .  
 fine ! let ’ s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome ! 
 i ’ ll tell you what   _comma_   i can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there  .  
 yay ! 
good evening   _comma_   mr  .  lee and thank you for choosing our airline  .  we have just discovered that this flight is overbooked  .  would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? 
 overbooked ? give up my seat ? i don ’ t understand  .  
 from time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft  .  that ’ s overbooked  .  
 i know what overbooked is   _comma_   i just don ’ t understand how that could happen ? 
 actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook     _comma_     as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled  .  most of the time there is no problem but today     _comma_     more passengers arrived than we have seats     _comma_     
 so who has to stay behind ? 
 well    _comma_    first we ask for volunteers  .  if someone like yourself volunteers    _comma_    they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year  .  if no one volunteers we just have to select someone  .  
 ok  .  i ’ ll volunteer  .  i could use a free ticket ! 
i want to rent this apartment  .  
 i ’ m glad to hear that  .  
 how much are you asking ? 
 you will have to pay        every month  .  
 i can ’ t afford that  .  
 what can you afford ? 
 i was thinking       a month  .  
 i ’ ll need you to pay more than that  .  
 how much more ? 
 how does       every month sound to you ? 
 i can live with that  .  
 we have a deal then  .  
good morning   _comma_   miss monica  .  nice to meet you again ! 
 good morning    _comma_    mr  .  thomas    _comma_    it is nice to see you too  .

 no probation is involved  .  if you feel good   _comma_   you can start next week  .

 it s on the service counter over there  .  please go to help yourself  .  
what s the name of this street ? 
 university street  .  
 do you know of any banks near here ? 
 you ll see one at the corner on your right  .  
hey there   _comma_   you look a little lost  .  are you new here ?

 in that case you want to work with less weight  .  you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets  .  five kilo weights should be enough  .  now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle  .

 it ’ s not that much  .  just watch  .  i ’ m ok  .

 do you have a hotel card or something ? 
 let s see . yes   _comma_   i have the address and telephone number here  .

 the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner  .  the station is at the end of that street  .  
 how long will it take me to get there ? 
 it s about a ten minute walk  .  
 that s very clear  .  i think i can find my way now  .  thank you  .  
 not at all  .  
how does the political system work in your country ? 
 we have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament  .  most people call them mp ’ s  .  
 each mp belongs to a political party   _comma_   right ? 
 almost all of them do  .  a few are independent  .  that means that they do not belong to a party  .  if one party more than half of the mp ’ s  .  they form a government  .  that means that they choose a prime finist 
 what ’ s a cabinet ? 
 this is a small group of people perhaps    mp ’ s who are usually ministers  .  they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy  .  
 can any mp make a law ? 
 any mp can present a law to parliament  .  the proposed law is debated and voted on  .  if it is accepted   _comma_   it becomes law  .  
 i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties  .  
 yes    _comma_    it does    _comma_    because they have most of the mp ’ s  .  most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to  .  
 how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ? 
 they produce manifesto  .  these documents which states their policies  .  some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election  .  voters who often change the party they vote for are calle

 what did you say ? 
 i told him that i hadn ’ t got a raise for three years  .  i also told him that one of my best co workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years  .  
 did he want to know the reasons ? 
 yes  .  i told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession  .  but i thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only  .  
 that ’ s sex discrimination  .  when will you get the reply ? 
 in a couple of days   _comma_   i was told  .  
 wish you good luck ! 
 thank you  .  
what qualities do you think a senior executive should possess ? 
 generally speaking      _comma_      he needs creativity      _comma_      the ability to communicate      _comma_      sense of personal responsibilities      _comma_      the ability to solve problems and so on  .

 so   _comma_   what s the problem ? 
 i need souvenirs ! 
 you want some souvenirs ! 
 yes   _comma_   yes  .  souvenirs  .

hi   _comma_   sam  .  i want to buy a pet  .  do you have any ideas ? 
 you really should go to rachel s pet store  .  
 why ? anything special there ? 
 it s more than special  .  you can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more  .  
 oh   _comma_   really ? are there any snakes ? 
 snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it s a world of exotic pets  .  
 that s terrific  .  i can t wait to check it out  .  
 hang on  .  are you sure you want to keep a non traditional pet ? 
 why not ? it s so cool  .  
 but it will pose a risk to your health  .  
 pardon ? 
 i mean   _comma_   most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria  .  they are likely to cause immune system problems  .  
 well   _comma_   i didn t realize that  .  
 i don t believe it s a good choice to keep those pets   _comma_   especially for families with young children  .  
 oh   _comma_   i should have thought of my brother s baby girl  .  maybe i ll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet  .  
 yes    _comma_    good luck    _comma_    maria  .  
i ’ m a new student  .  my name ’ s robert  .  
 nice to meet you  .  my name ’ s sophie  .

hi there ! i am looking for a new car  .  i have this old ford pinto that i would like to trade in  .  
 i see  .  you are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ’ s the end of the year  .  
 perfect ! i like this one  .  
 that is the ford focus  .  a very light but powerful vehicle  .  it comes with dual side airbags    _comma_    power steering and power windows    _comma_    tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission  .  
 sounds like a good car ! how many miles to the gallon ? 
 it is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about    miles in the city and    on the highway  .  
 that is really convenient  .  especially now that fuel prices are so high ! what ’ s under the hood ? 
 a very powerful   .    liter turbocharged engine    _comma_    trust me    _comma_    this car is fast ! 
 now for the most difficult question  .  what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ? 
 very affordable mam  .  you can take it out of this lot today with   % down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back  .  
 great ! let ’ s do it ! 
i wonder if you could help me   _comma_   i m looking for a room  .  
 well   _comma_   i have got a vacancy  .  
 what sort of price are you asking ? 
 eight dolls fifty a week excluding laundry  .  
 would it be convenient to see the room ? 
 can you call back later ? we re right in the middle of lunch  .  
could you give me an expense report ? i would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season  .  
 here you are  .  do you need glue ? 
 that is very kind of you  .  i ’ m just running out of glue  .

iba   _comma_   jane speaking  .  how can i help you ? 
 hello  .  i d like to speak to someone regarding my card  .  
 sorry    _comma_    i m not quite sure if i understand  .  in what way    _comma_    sir ? has your card been stolen ? 
 no     _comma_     no  .  nothing at all like that  .  it s just that i applied for a credit card with you a while ago     _comma_     my application was accepted     _comma_     but i m still waiting for my card  .  
 oh     _comma_     i see     _comma_     sir  .  well     _comma_     it does take   working days to issue and post the card  .  
 yes    _comma_    my application was accepted last friday  .  now it s wednesday    _comma_    that s more than   days  .  
 sorry     _comma_     sir     _comma_     but it s   working days  .  this does not include weekends     _comma_     so your card should be with you later this week  .  
 of course ! how silly of me ! yes    _comma_      working days would mean this friday    _comma_    at the earliest  .  i see  .  i m sorry to trouble you  .  
 it s no trouble at all   _comma_   sir  .  is there anything else i can help you with today ? 
 nothing    _comma_    thanks  .  i again apologise for the misunderstanding    _comma_    bye for now  .  
what can i do for you   _comma_   sir ? 
 we d like to order breakfast for tomorrow morning  .  
 yes   _comma_   sir  .  what would you like ? 
 orange juice     _comma_     scrambled eggs     _comma_     bacon     _comma_     toast and coffee  .

 about seven thirty . by the way   _comma_   could you also bring me tomorrow s papers ? 
 of course   _comma_   sir  .  
what shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment ? 
 you should do one of the two things   either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company  .  
 shall we leave it to the brokers ? 
 yes  .  they usually do it  .  
 do they charge for that ? 
 of course  .  in europe   _comma_   they charge a commission of   % of the amount of the claim for their service  .  
 is it the same in america ? 
 they do the work without charge to the importer  .  
 it s part of their service   _comma_   isn t it ? 
 exactly  .  
 is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ? 
 no   _comma_   you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment  .  
 i see  .  by the way   _comma_   how do we prove the ownership of our goods ? 
 you must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice  .  
 i see  .  thank you  .  
 you are welcome  .  
i ll be on business for a couple of days   _comma_   could you take care of your sister ?

 thank you   _comma_   the service was good 
 please come again  .  
nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films  .  so i am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive  .  
 what you said is true  .  but the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience  .  for example    _comma_    to make more movie ccds    _comma_    so people will spend money buying them  .  
 but it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past  .  
 yes  .  take myself for example  .  i seldom go to cinemas    _comma_    but it doesn t mean i no longer see films ; instead    _comma_    i see films at home watching ccds  .  
okay   _comma_   well i ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position  .  
 yes    _comma_    well miss childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone    _comma_    but there were some details i ’ d like to clarify  .  
 well feel free to ask me anything   _comma_   and i ’ ll try to fill in the details  .  
 could i first ask about the remuneration package ? 
 yes     _comma_     of course  .  that ’ s quite an important point     _comma_     isn ’ t it ? as a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of        _comma_        hk dollars per annum  .  this doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance also  .  
 i understand  .  and are there other bonuses included ? 
 well   _comma_   apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers  .  but we could go through all the details of that at a later date  .  
 well    _comma_    mr  .  parsons    _comma_    i am flexible when it comes to salary  .  the opportunity to work in hong kong for you is the most important thing for me  .  
 excellent  .  well   _comma_   what other questions do you have rebecca ? 
we need to take the accounts system offline to carry out the upgrade  .  but don t worry   _comma_   it won t cause too much inconvenience  .  we re going to do it over the weekend  .  
 how long will the system be down for ? 
 we ll be taking everything offline in about two hours   time  .  it ll be down for a minimum of twelve hours  .  if everything goes according to plan   _comma_   it should be up again by   pm on saturday  .  
 that s fine  .  we ve allowed forty eight hours to be on the safe side  .  
welcome to iba  .  can i help you ? 
 yes    _comma_    please  .  i m here for an international settlement  .  our company has to effect payment    _comma_    and it needs to be done today  .  here s the advice slip for the payment  .  
 thanks  .  i m sorry to say that you need to get this stamped  .  there is no stamp on this slip and it is essential before i can process it for you  .

that s the warehouse where the large items of office equipment are stored  .  
 if i ordered a desk today   _comma_   how would it be before i got delivery in scotland ?

excuse me  .  i have just missed the connection plane due to the heavy fog in london  .  can i change my ticket now ?

david    _comma_    we have been doing business for three years    _comma_    haven t we ? 
 yes   _comma_   i m glad we ve had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years  .  and your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years  .  
 so    _comma_    i wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market  .  if you give us the agency    _comma_    that will be more substantial for our cooperation  .  
 to be frank   _comma_   you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country  .  i d like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent  .  
 as we are a well established company    _comma_    we are very familiar with the customers   needs  .  besides    _comma_    we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent  .  
 sounds reasonable  .  i will tell my boss about you agent application  .  another question   _comma_   what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ? 
 to be on the safe side       _comma_       and for garment of all materials       _comma_       sizes       _comma_       and styles       _comma_       i think the amount will be         _comma_          pieces a year  .  
 well  .  as our sole agency   _comma_   you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re export our goods to any other area outside your own  .

 but sir   _comma_   many employees use instant messaging to communicate with their clients  .  
 they will just have to change their communication methods  .  i don t want any   one using instant messaging in this office . it wastes too much time ! now   _comma_   please continue with the memo . where were we ?

 are you having any luck ? 
 not really  .  there aren t any used bookcases listed  .  but there are a few rummage sales on saturday  .  i think i ll go to them  .  
 do you mind if i go with you ? 
 not at all  .  these private sales are great places to bargain  .  and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk  .  
 i learned to negotiate from my mother  .  i thought i was pretty good at bargaining   _comma_   but i had a problem the other day at kimble s department store  .  
 what happened ? 
 i wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend  .  it was priced at forty dollars   _comma_   so i started by offering the salesclerk thirty  .  
do you do a lot of your shopping online ? 
 not really  .  i like looking on the internet at what ’ s available     _comma_     but i usually prefer to actually see and touch what i ’ m buying before i pay for it  .  sometimes     _comma_     i ’ ll look at something in a shop     _comma_     but lat 
 no  .  i ’ m a little worried about security  .  you never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords  .  aren ’ t you worry about that ? 
 not really  .  i know that it happens     _comma_     but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites     _comma_     you should be ok  .  even though i use online shopping facilities     _comma_     i don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho 
 i ’ m surprised to hear you say that  .  i thought you loved anything technological  .  
 i do  .  i ’ m a big fan of using new technology   _comma_   but i don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day  .  i think people need to get out and interact with other people  .  
 so   _comma_   how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet  .

 it ’ s as easy as pie  .  i always follow recipes  .  
mr  .  dick  .  does the recommendation of the university play an important role ? 
 yes  .  in fact      _comma_      the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self recommendation  .  in the long period of cooperation      _comma_      the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations      _comma_      they trust each other well  .  if your university recommends you      _comma_      you can be approved more easily  .  
 but i find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same  .  so i doubt its authority  .  
 more and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy  .  if your university also does like this    _comma_    you can look for other methods    _comma_    because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you  .  
 could you tell me whether or not i send out my resume with it ? 
 it depends  .  if it has something special or useful   _comma_   i suggest you send it out  .  
taylor   _comma_   can you tell me how to apply for a job on the internet ? 
 just fill out an application  .  
 do i have to send an e mail ? 
 you are expected to know the e mail address of the unit  .  
 but i still don t know which unit is in need of staff  .  
 send out an application through job wanted on the website  .  
 can any unit see my information ? 
 it s a two way choice  .  and your application will be read  .  
 which websites offer this service ? 
 sina    _comma_      st century talent net    _comma_    and a few others  .

 yes  .  i was a member of the basketball society  .  i like playing basketball  .

 it ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend  .  nobody sticks around in the summer  .  
 really ? then   _comma_   i guess i won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ? 
 actually   _comma_   you might because there ’ s a big convention in town this weekend  .  
 i ’ m not too worried about it  .  i always seem to find something  .  
hello   _comma_   how can i help you today ? 
 i d like to withdraw some money from my account  .  
 please fill out this slip stating how much you wish to withdraw  .  
 well    _comma_    actually    _comma_    it s quite a substantial amount  .  here s my bank book  .  will that cause a problem ?

quality is very important to us  .  we work to very low tolerance levels  .  we need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials  .  over the years we ve built up very good relationships with our suppliers  .  
 do you have many different suppliers ? 
 yes  .  there are about fifty names on our approved supplier list   _comma_   but for raw materials we tend to deal with three local companies  .  
mary   _comma_   can you tell me how you keep in shape ? 
 you ll never be in shape until you eat less and take more exercise  .  
 now   _comma_   tell me what you often eat  .  
 i often eat fish and eggs  .

 oh yes   _comma_   and fruits  .  i love fruits very much  .

 well   _comma_   i walk every day  .  
 it s a good diet and a regular exercise  .  
 yes   _comma_   quite right  .  
i am sorry   _comma_   but i cannot stay for the rest of class today  .  
 why do you need to leave early ? 
 i don ’ t feel so good  .  
 what doesn ’ t feel right ? 
 i feel as if i am going to be sick to my stomach  .  
 perhaps you should get checked out at the student health center before you go home  .  
 i have some medicine at home that i could take  .  
 are you going to be ok to drive home   _comma_   or would you like someone to go with you ? 
 thank you    _comma_    but my friend is in the library    _comma_    and he can give me a ride home  .  
 we hope that you are feeling better soon  .  e mail me if you have any questions  .  
your boyfriend is so considerate to you  .  when do you plan to marry ? 
 it ’ s still up in the air  .  there is something wrong between us  .  
we re considering of ordering     computers   _comma_   but i m wondering about the price you ll possibly offer  .  
 our price will be not less than         .  
 your price is higher than i expected  .  could you give us a little discount ? 
 this is already our best price  .  
 but the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order  .  
 well   _comma_   what would you suggest ? 
 could you make it        ? 
 i m afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price  .  this is the best price we can quote  .  
 can we meet each other half way ? 
 what do you mean ? 
 let s close the deal at          _comma_   ok ? 
 you drive a hard bargain ! ok   _comma_   that s a deal  .  
i m now on the songshan airport getting ready for departure  .  i realized that i might have left my watch  .  
 yes   _comma_   ma am  .  may i have your name and room number ? 
 my name is terry  .  i stayed last night in your hotel in room      .  
 what kind of watch is it ? 
 it s a brand new seiko wrist watch  .  
 yes   _comma_   we have it  .  
 oh   _comma_   i m glad to hear that  .  would you kindly send it to the hilton hotel ? 
what are your thoughts on the apartment ? 
 i think that it ’ s absolutely gorgeous  .  
 there aren ’ t any problems with the apartment ? 
 i think that the apartment looks very nice   _comma_   but i do see some problems  .  
 what problems ? 
 i did notice a few stains in the carpet  .  
 we will have the carpet cleaned before you move in  .  
 you will ? 
 yes    _comma_    but other than that    _comma_    are there any more problems ? 
 that was the only thing that i saw that was wrong with the apartment  .  
 i ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing  .  
 it is  .  i love it  .  
that china gown of tang dynasty style is so beautiful  .  would you show it to me   _comma_   please ? 
 absolutely  .  here it is  .  
 could i try it on ? 
 please do   _comma_   the fitting room is over there  .  
 it feels a little tight around the waist  .  do you have a bigger one ? 
 i m sorry  .  we don t have this color in your size  .  we have some green ones in your size  .  would you please have a look at this green one ? 
 ok  .  how much does it cost ? 
 it s     yuan  .  
mrs  .  wang   _comma_   would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? 
 as i said before   _comma_   your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid  .  we hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap  .  
 just to comply   _comma_   we re ready to reduce the price by   percent  .  i hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling  .  
 so do we  .  certainly it s a step forward on your side  .  but the gap is still too wide  .  
 the ball is in your court   _comma_   mrs . wang  .  what price would you suggest ? 
 to make your offer workable   _comma_   i think you should take another step down as big as the one you ve just taken  .  
 that won t do  .  you see   _comma_   our profit margin is very narrow  .  it simply can t stand such a big cut  .  
 i hate to disappoint you      _comma_      mr  .  brown      _comma_      but if that s the case      _comma_      we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere  .  do think it over      _comma_      please  .  we sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion  .  
 well    _comma_    i m not authorized to agree to such a big reduction  .  would you mind waiting a day or two    _comma_    until i get a reply from the home office ? 
 not at all  .  shall we meet again    _comma_    say    _comma_    on friday morning ? 
 good  .  friday morning at    .  
good morning  .  
 good morning . this is mary . can i speak to anne please ? 
 i ’ m sorry she isn ’ t in at the momment . she will come back at half past ninecan i take a message for her ? 
 thank you . but i will call her later 
 ok . goodbye  .  
 goodbye  .  
hi   _comma_   jane  .  how are you doing this morning ? 
 i ’ m all right   _comma_   thanks  .  just a little tired  .  
 late night ? 
 yeah   _comma_   i got home around two  .  
we ve been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now   _comma_   and there still isn t a bus in sight  .  
 i m afraid we ll be late for the party  .  
 have you got the time   _comma_   tom ? 
 yes   _comma_   my watch says a quarter to seven  .  but there is something wrong with my watch ! 
 but you bought it only last month  .  
 yes     _comma_     but ever since i bought it     _comma_     it gains about five minutes a day     _comma_     so i   ve got to have it repaired  .  
 how long will it take us to get there ? 
 i think about ten minutes by bus  .  
 it s not far away    _comma_    then  .  let s walk    _comma_    it s beginning to rain  .  
 wait ! i think i see a bus coming now  .  let s hope it s the no  .     bus  .  
hi   _comma_   mr  .  smith  .  i m doctor hawkins  .  why are you here today ? 
 i found it would be a good idea to get a check up  .  
 yes    _comma_    well    _comma_    you haven t had one for   years  .  you should have one every year  .  
 i know  .  i figure as long as there is nothing wrong   _comma_   why go see the doctor ? 
 well   _comma_   the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early  .  so try to come at least once a year for your own good  .  
 ok  .  
 let me see here  .  your eyes and ears look fine  .  take a deep breath    _comma_    please  .  do you smoke    _comma_    mr  .  smith ? 
 yes  .  
 smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease   _comma_   you know  .  you really should quit  .  
 i ve tried hundreds of times   _comma_   but i just can t seem to kick the habit  .  
 well   _comma_   we have classes and some medications that might help  .  i ll give you more information before you leave  .  
 ok   _comma_   thanks doctor  .  
good afternoon  .  mr  .  tylor s office ? 
 i m afraid you ve got the wrong extension  .  
 i m sorry   _comma_   but could you please transfer this call to mr  .  tylor s office ? 
 sure   _comma_   please hold on  .  
 thank you  .  
 now mr  .  tylor s on the line  .  go ahead   _comma_   please  .  
 you are so kind   _comma_   you helped me a lot  .  
 you are welcome  .  bye ! 
good afternoon    _comma_    lexington software  .  angelina dawson    _comma_    how can i help ? 
 hello   _comma_   this is quinn from iba  .  
 ah     _comma_     hello quinn  .  oh dear     _comma_     you are calling to tell me there is a problem     _comma_     aren t you ? 
 i m afraid so   _comma_   yes  .  
 hmm  .  well    _comma_    it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake    _comma_    or can we just alter it ? 
 unfortunately it s rather a big mistake  .  
 what do you recommend we do ? 
 i would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible  .  
 i trust your judgement  .  thank you   _comma_   quinn  .  i ll be back tomorrow with a new set  .  bye for now  .  
oh ! ! ! i have a horrible toothache  .  
 you should go to the dentist  .  
 i hate dentists  .  
 well    _comma_    suffer then  .  if you have a toothache    _comma_    you have to go to the dentist  .  
 it always hurts  .  i hate going  .  
 stop being such a baby  .  if it really hurts that much   _comma_   just let them knock you out  .  
 o  .  k  .     _comma_    o  .  k  .     _comma_    i ’ ll go  .  
 good  .  you ll feel better after you do  .  
hi    _comma_    i would like to purchase a one way ticket to brussels    _comma_    please  .  
 certainly sir   _comma_   this is our train schedule  .  we have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm  .  
 how long does it take to get there ? 
 about twelve hours  .  we currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train  .  if you ’ d like   _comma_   you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive  .  
 yeah   _comma_   i think that is the best option  .  do you serve food on the train ? twelve hours is such a long time ! 
 yes   _comma_   of course  .  there is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times  .  we do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers  .  
 great ! i ’ ll take it  .  
 here you are sir  .  your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot  .  remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! 
 i understand  .  thank you very much ! 
 have a great trip  .  
i would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend  .  
 a trip to the beach would be fun  .  how is the weather going to be ? 
 the forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend  .  
 so do you think it ll be perfect weather for the beach ? 
 it sounds like it will be  .  
 i really hope it doesn t get cold  .  
 that would ruin things   _comma_   i want to go so badly  .  
 the weather in california is unpredictable   _comma_   so you never know  .  
 that is true  .  the weather is constantly changing  .  
 it would be nice if the weather would never change  .  
 that would be great   _comma_   then we could plan things sooner  .  
 true  .  predictable weather would make life easier  .  
some companies use to ban dating among employees   _comma_   but now they have realized it is something in avertable  .  people spend so much time at work  .  it is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other  .  
 if we think positively   _comma_   office love can be beneficial to company  .  
 beneficial ? i don ’ t think so  .  if two employees get married      _comma_      they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon      _comma_      or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies  .  if they break up      _comma_      the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable  .  by any means      _comma_      the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating  .  
 but if two employees are in love    _comma_    they will be happy  .  happy people are more productive  .  if they develop an intimate relation with each other    _comma_    they are willing to share knowledge and experience  .  it can help to improve work efficiency  .  
 i doubt that  .  
do you eat a lot of healthy food ? 
 compared with healthy food     _comma_     unhealthy food just tastes so much better  .  and anyway     _comma_     i believe if you live a low stress life and are active     _comma_     you can get away with eating whatever you like  .  it s all in the mind  .  
 you have the point  .  i think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume  .  some good things you should try are cranberry juice   _comma_   wild rice and yoghurt  .  
 what s special about these things ? 
 cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it s very acidic  .  wild rice is high in fibre so it s good for your guts and it s high in protein and minerals i think it s also tastier than normal rice  .  yoghurt s good because it s also rich in protein    _comma_    vitamins and is also acidic  .  people have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day    _comma_    your guts will be much more settled  .  
 thanks  .  i m going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now  .  
i ve been so tired recently  .  i ve been trying   _comma_   but i don t think i m up to this job  .  
 you need to take a break   _comma_   maybe a vacation  .  
 oh     _comma_     yes     _comma_     indeed  .  i ve run out of steam  .  to be honest     _comma_     i want to be in a different environment  .  
 is that so ? 
 yes   _comma_   i don t want to be stuck in a rut  .  i want to move on  .  
 have you decided ? 
 yes  .  i want to get a better job  .  
 could you tell me why you want to quit ? 
 i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues  .  
 oh   _comma_   that s terrible  .  do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? 
 i m afraid not  .  i ve promised my girlfriend  .  we ll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay  .  
 ok    _comma_    i d like to say that i ve really enjoyed working with you  .  however    _comma_    i think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay  .  
 thank you so much for your advice  .  
 and every best wish for your new job  .  
 thank you  .  
the train is leaving  .  hurry up ! which car are we in ? 
 let me see  .  oh   _comma_   no  .      .  
 here we are   _comma_   car     .  let s get in  .  
 seats no  .     and     .  it ’ s nice that we ’ ve got a window seat  .  
 let s put our suitcases on the rack  .  
 oh   _comma_   the baggage rack is full  .  put them under the seat for the time being  .  
 all right  .  
so   _comma_   how should we get to the theatre ? 
 let s take the bus  .  
 i hate the bus system in london ! the bus drivers are rude    _comma_    the buses are never on time    _comma_    and there are few people around who can help you  .  
 it s not that bad  .  you probably just had a bad experience once  .  
 it wasn t just once  .  every single time i take the bus   _comma_   something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus  .  
 we could take the subway   _comma_   but we d have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice  .  
 train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare   _comma_   too  .  
 if we don t hurry up   _comma_   we ll miss the show  .  should we take the bus ? 
 we re already late   _comma_   so i think we had better take a taxi  .  
 i don t think we ll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours  .  let s just take the bus  .  
 fine  .  have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives  .  
 it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes  .  don t worry  .  nothing bad will happen  .  i ll even buy your ticket for you  .  
 thanks   _comma_   that was nice of you  .  
 see   _comma_   now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! 
let s go over this plan again  .  
 from vancouver   _comma_   we bike along the border all the way to winnipeg  .  
 and that is mostly flat   _comma_   right ? 
 relatively    _comma_    once we re out of alberta    _comma_    anyway  .  then it s hills again in aitoba  .  
 and from winnipeg we go around the lakes through toronto   _comma_   right ? 
 that s right  .  and up in to quebec  .  and that s where we stop  .  
 it doesn t sound like that much when we go over the plan but that s a long   _comma_   long ride  .  
 are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ? 
good morning   _comma_   sir  .  what can i do for you ? 
 i m bill  .  i m in room      .  can you change the room for me ? it s too noisy  .  my wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made  .  she said it was too much for her  .  
 i m awfully sorry   _comma_   sir  .  i do apologize  .  room     is at the end of the corridor  .  it s possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet  .  
 anyhow   _comma_   i d like to change our room  .  
 no problem    _comma_    sir  .  we ll manage it    _comma_    but we don t have any spare room today  .  could you wait till tomorrow ? the american people to people education delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning  .  there ll be some rooms for you to choose from  .  
 all right  .  i hope we ll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep  .  
 be sure  .  i ll make a note of that  .  everything will be taken care of  .  and if there is anything more you need   _comma_   please let us know  .  
it s time for bed  .  
 i m not ready to go to sleep  .  i m not tired  .  
 it s quite late   _comma_   and you have an early day tomorrow  .  
 i m not going to be able to fall asleep  .  
 why don t you try counting sheep ? 
 i ve tried that before  .  it really doesn t work  .  
 that s beside the point   _comma_   you still need to go to bed  .  
 why can t i just stay up until i fall asleep ? 
 if i let you do that   _comma_   then you re just going to be up all night  .  
 i promise i ll go to sleep soon  .  
 no    _comma_    you re going to sleep now    _comma_    so good night  .  
 see you in the morning  .  
i see myself as being honest    _comma_    diligent    _comma_    persevering and creative  .  and i have a strong sense of responsibility  .  
 how about your psychological resilience ? 
 i think i can work well under pressure   _comma_   if necessary  .  
 how would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ? 
 i will just be sincere and friendly to others   _comma_   and i believe they will treat me the same way  .  
 you seem to be a kind hearted lady  .  
 thank you  .  i simply believe the goodness of human nature  .  
 please tell me your weaknesses if you can  .  
 i should admit that sometimes i care too much about the details  .  i am always in pursuit of perfection  .  
karen ? i need to go over a few things with you  .  
 certainly  .  mr  .  graham  .  when would you like to meet ? 
 i was thinking about this afternoon   _comma_   after the sales meeting  .  
 fine  .  at  :   ? 
i believe we   ve met before  .  my name s david  .  
 yes    _comma_    at your company    _comma_    i think  .  i m frank  .  
 oh   _comma_   i remember now . very nice to meet you again  .  
 nice meeting you   _comma_   too  .  
i made my little brother cry  .  
 shame on you ! 
i need some mascara  .  do you have good thickening mascara ? 
 of course  .  here is our thickening mascara  .  we also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes  .  
 alright  .  and i want to consider your eye shadow too  .  do you have a color chart can look at ? 
 we have a very wide selection of colors  .  and our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin  .  so it is very gentle on your eyelids  .  would you like to sample some ? 
 oh   _comma_   sure i will need to clean off my own eye shadow first  .  
 i can help you with that  .  
 thank you  .  
is this the baggage claim area for flight kb    ? 
 yes   _comma_   we are on the same plane  .  
 but i am a transfer passenger  .  i have a connecting flight to miami  .  
 so you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check in area  .  
 yes . it   s quite troublesome  .  
 why not go and find a porter ? 
billy   _comma_   you don ’ t look too well  .  maybe you should take the day off school  .  
 but mom ! today we ’ re playing football ! i love football ! 
 you ’ ve got a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever  .  what ’ s that on your arm ? 
 i don ’ t know  .  it was there when i woke up this morning  .  
 it ’ s rash  .  i ’ d better take you to see the doctor  .  how did you get that bruise on your leg ? 
 i bashed it against the chair in my room  .  
 does it hurt ? 
 a little   _comma_   but not much  .  
 here  .  put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down  .  i ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast  .  
 if i ’ m better this afternoon   _comma_   can i go to school ? 
 if you are better   _comma_   but i doubt you will be  .  
this is your schedule  .  
 you re going out of your way for us   _comma_   i believe  .  
 you are our honored guests  .  
are there any vacancies still available ? 
 yes  .  we need a plumber here  .  
 i am looking for a job that is more advanced than that   _comma_   such as sales manager or regional manager  .  
 i am sorry  .  they are not available now  .  
my name is mary   _comma_   and i will be your waitress tonight  .  
 thank you   _comma_   mary  .  we have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant  .  
 before your main course   _comma_   would you like to order an appetizer ? 
 sure   _comma_   that sounds great  .  where are your appetizers listed ? 
 there is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table  .  
 the chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good  .  is that pretty good ? 
 you know   _comma_   that is one of my favorites ! 
 ok   _comma_   i ll take one order of that  .  
 you could choose another appetizer for half price to share  .  
 perfect ! please add on an order of onion rings  .  
i am waiting for a fax but just now i found there s something wrong with the fax machine  .  
 what s wrong with the fax machine ? is it urgent ? 
 yes    _comma_    very urgent  .  and there is no other fax machine around  .  and the office of our boss is closed    _comma_    so i can not use his machine either  .  and his secretary is out  .  do you have any suggestion ? 
 either call this extension number      or ask them to send the fax to you as e mail   _comma_   you print it out  .  
i would like to speak to you   _comma_   if you don ’ t mind  .  
 what would you like to speak to me about ? 
 i would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election  .  
 is that right ? 
 i am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign  .  
 that ’ s wonderful  .  i am impressed at someone so young taking a stand  .  
 i know history is about to be made   _comma_   and i would like to be a part of it  .  
 that ’ s fantastic  .  
 are you planning on voting ? 
 i ’ m going to vote  .  
 go to your polling place early on election day  .  
 i will  .  good luck with your volunteering  .  
we hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future  .  
 yes  .  i promise it will not happen again  .  
 we look forward to your settlement at an early date  .  
 we will inform you as soon as possible  .  
hello   _comma_   steven  .  how do you get along with your job ? 
 actually   _comma_   i learn many things from it  .  i find that i am a quick learner in new things  .  
 practice makes perfect  .  by the way   _comma_   what do you learn from your job ? 
 at first i didn t know anything about the machine  .  now i know how to operate it  .  besides   _comma_   the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement  .  
 yeah   _comma_   you are a good learner  .  i must commend you for your good performance  .  
 thank you  .  that s a long way to go for my job  .  
 i appreciate your effort very much  .  the coffee break is over ; it s about time we set to work  .  
 ok   _comma_   let s go  .  
where on earth are we ? 
 judging by all the traffic   _comma_   i d say we re near the outskirts of the city  .  
 what did i do wrong ? did i take a wrong turn ? 
 i m not sure   _comma_   but i think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge  .  
 well   _comma_   now we should turn back a few kilometres  .  
 it seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map  .  
hello  .  front desk  .  
 yes  .  this is bob robinson  .  i ’ m calling from room number      .  
 hi   _comma_   bob  .  what can i do for you ? 
 is it possible to change to another room ? 
 could you please tell me why ? 
 my room is facing the swimming pool  .  it ’ s noisy for me  .  i have a problem sleeping  .  and i feel uncomfortable when i take an elevator  .  
 so you need a quiet side room on the lower floor  .  
 you ’ re right  .  
 okay  .  let me check for a room on the first floor  .  
 thank you  .  
 i ’ ve only two rooms on the first floor  .  how about room     ? 
 that ’ s fine  .  can i move now ? 
 sure  .  i ’ ll send the bellman to help you  .  
 oh   _comma_   thank you kindly  .  
 you ’ re welcome  .  
how long will it take for our order to be delivered ? 
 let s see  .  you are importing fifty containers of textiles from china  .  they should be able to place your order before the end of next week  .  it will take   days for shipping to the port city of ningpo  .  the freight will take   weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in los angeles approximately a month from today  .  domestic shipping will be your responsibility   _comma_   you can make arrangements with the pier in los angeles  .  
 fine    _comma_    we will handle domestic shipping    _comma_    but what about customs ? will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? i hope we don t run into any problems with the border control  .  
 no    _comma_    the chinese company has that all worked out  .  with the paperwork you receive with the shipment    _comma_    you should be good to go  .  
now you re my boss   _comma_   mr  .  henry  .  
 do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
 no   _comma_   nothing in particular  .  
 you may ask questions about us   _comma_   if you have any  .  
 all right  .  when can i start ? 
what are you doing here today ? 
 i would like to fight my ticket  .  
 is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ? 
 yes   _comma_   the officer is here today  .  
 what s your case ? 
 i was pulled over for running a red light   _comma_   but i never did  .  
 do you believe that the officer lied ? 
 there was a camera on the signal  .  so   _comma_   he was obviously lying  .  
 your license plate was caught on camera ? 
 a picture of my license plate was never taken  .  
 since there is no picture of your license plate on record   _comma_   i m going to let you go  .  
 thank you  .  i m glad that you believe me  .  
hey joe   _comma_   what are you doing in this department store ? 
 hi    _comma_    rita    _comma_    i m just looking for a pair of shoes  .  i won t be here for long  .  
 why not ? when i go shoe shopping   _comma_   i have so many options for sneakers that i spend awhile looking at all of the choices  .  
 that s my problem  .  i don t have a lot of options  .  
 what do you mean ? this is a big store   _comma_   isn t it ? 
 yes    _comma_    but i have unusually big feet  .  that wouldn t be too much of a problem except that they re also very wide    _comma_    and only a few brands sell shoes that i can fit into  .  
 so how do you usually go about buying shoes   _comma_   then ? 
 well    _comma_    first of all    _comma_    i can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection  .  
 well    _comma_    you re in the right store  .  if they don t have it    _comma_    no one will  .  
 after that i choose something from one of the few brands that i know will fit me  .  i prefer white    _comma_    so i ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size  .  since i ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications    _comma_    it makes it a very easy choice  .  
what shall we do after the volleyball match ? 
 how about going to the olympic souvenir store to have a look ? i remember there is one in the gym  .  
 that s a good idea  .  i was thinking of buying some gifts for my family  .  
 me   _comma_   too  .  what did you have in mind ? 
 i haven t decided yet   _comma_   but i think the olympic mascots are a must  .  
 i agree  .  they re very lovely   _comma_   especially   huan huan    .  
 is that the red one ? that is my favorite   _comma_   too  .  do you know how much they are ? 
 the five dolls are sold together as a set   _comma_   and they re priced according to the size  .  the bigger they are the more expensive  .  
 oh    _comma_    i see  .  if i buy more than a set    _comma_    can i get any discount ? 
 i don t think so  .  all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now  .  
 any other ideas ? 
 there are lots of things     _comma_     such as postcards     _comma_     key chains     _comma_     posters and various arts and crafts  .  
 it all sounds great  .  we can go there after the match  .  i can t wait to see what they have  .  
mom ! i hate eating vegetables ! 
 you don ’ t have to eat them  .  i don ’ t mind  .  
 thanks mom ! can i have dessert now ? i love chocolate cake ! 
 no dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables  .  
 but i don ’ t like them ! it ’ s not fair ! 
 you can have some fruit for dessert  .  if you eat an apple and a banana   _comma_   i might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake  .  
 ok  .  actually    _comma_    i don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots    _comma_    buy i hate broccoli and cauliflower  .  
 i ’ ll remember that for next time  .  you ’ ll get extra peas and carrots   _comma_   buy no broccoli or cauliflower  .  ok ? 
 thanks mom ! 
it was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place  .  it gave me a good idea of your product range  .  
 it ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers  .  what ’ s your general impression   _comma_   may i ask ? 
 very impressive    _comma_    indeed    _comma_    especially the speed of your nw model  .  
 that ’ s our latest development  .  a product with high performance  .  we put it on the market just two months ago  .  
 the machine gives you an edge over your competitors   _comma_   i guess  .  
 certainly  .  no one can match us as far as speed is concerned  .  
 could you give me some brochures for that machine ? and the price if possible  .  
 right  .  here is our sales catalog and literature  .  
 thank you  .  i think we may be able to work together in the future  .  
is the factory fully automated ? 
 not completely  .  our production process is partially automated  .  we use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually  .  
 what about supply of parts to the production line ? 
 well   _comma_   the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar code system  .  and there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line  .  
 what about the smaller components ? 
 they re transported to the workstations on automated vehicles   robot trucks   which run on guide rails around the factory  .  
i m glad you re on your ten year reunion planning committee  .  
 yeah   _comma_   you get the tv to yourself while i spend my nights surfing the net for missing classmates  .  
 that s not why  .  this way i can see how you guys do this sort of thing  .  
 i guess  .  don t you have reunions in taiwan ? 
 definitely  .  every year  .  but just for our forty person class  .  
 ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year  .  
what does your job involve ? 
 i m the project manager so i have to make sure our projects run smoothly  .  i work with three project engineers  .  they take care of after sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business  .  
how many languages can you speak ? 
 besides chinese   _comma_   i can speak english and french  .  
 you mean you can read and write both of them ? 
 no   _comma_   i can only carry on a simple conversation in french  .  
 can you read and write english well ? 
 i can speak the language better than read and write  .  
 do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of english speaking countries ? 
 i think so  .  i used to be an interpreter  .  
 do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ? 
 the amount of english i know enables me to do general desk work  .  i believe what i know is sufficient to work in an american firm  .  
what can i get for you ? here is the menu  .  
 let me have a look  .  well   _comma_   how many kinds of steaks do you have ? 
 we have sirloin steaks    _comma_    pepper steak    _comma_    and filet steak  .  
 is there something go with the filet steak ? 
 yes   _comma_   we have various sauces  .  what about the gravy ? 
are you ready to go shopping ? 
 just a minute  .  i need to make a list of thinks that we need  .  
 good idea  .  have you written down potatoes    _comma_    carrots    _comma_    and onions ? 
 i don ’ t have onions on my list  .  i ’ ll add them  .  we should get some tea  .  is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ? 
 let ’ s get both  .  we need some coffee too  .  is that on your list ? 
 yes   _comma_   it is  .  here ’ s my list  .  is there anything that i ’ ve forgotten ? 
 i think you ’ ve got everything  .  i want to got some chocolate and some cheese  .  
 what kind of cheese do you want  .  
 i ’ m not sure  .  i ’ ll decide at the cheese counter   _comma_   when i can see what they have  .  have we got enough money ? 
 we don ’ t have enough cash   _comma_   so i ’ ll take my credit card and we can pay with that  .  where are the car keys ? 
 i ’ ve got them there  .  shall i drive ? 
hello   _comma_   can you tell me how to use the telephone ? 
 if you want to order meals    _comma_    call      . if you need other help    _comma_    call      and someone will be there  .  
 thank you so much  .  by the way   _comma_   is there a mail service ? 
 yes   _comma_   you can take your letters to the counter over there  .  
hi   _comma_   i am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow  .  a technician has just come and checked it  .  he will bring me a new one tomorrow  .  it seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing  .  can i use the one in your office ? 
 of course you can  .  i am sure this one works very well  .  i just sent dozens of pages  .  how many pages are you sending ? are you familiar with my fax machine ? 
 yes   _comma_   i think you have the same model as i have  .  does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? 
 yes   _comma_   it will print immediately  .  
how many years have you done business with china ? 
 let me see    _comma_    about five years    _comma_    we established our business relationship with hua mei of china import & export corporation in       .  
 do you have any difficulties in doing business in china ? you know the chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ? 
 i don t think i have any problem with our chinese partners  .  they have always followed the contract strictly  .  we can do business directly with the corporation  .  as i mentioned before   _comma_   the chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law  .  its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies  .  
 well   _comma_   it s known that the sino american relation is in a dilemma  .  does it influence your business in china ? 
 actually not at present  .  but we are afraid it will  .  you know policies influence business to some extent  .  i hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists  .  china is really a large market  .  we don t want to lose it  .  
 thank you  .  
 you re welcome  .  
give me a pack of first class stamps   _comma_   please  .  
 here you are  .  that will be five dollars  .  anything else ? 
 yes  .  i want some post cards and some airmail stamps  .  i want to send some letters to south america  .  
 just a moment   _comma_   i ll look up the rate for air mail letters to south america  .  
 can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to colombia ? also   _comma_   i what to know how long it will take  .  
 do you have the package with you ? i would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost  .  
 do you insure package ? 
 yes  .  all you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for  .  
 is there a way that i can be sure that the people in south america receive my package ? 
 the post office rarely loses package  .  you can    _comma_    however    _comma_    request a rectum receipt  .  
 one last question what are your hours ? 
 we open at eight thirty in the morning and close at five thirty in the afternoon  .  
 thank you   _comma_   you helped me a lot  .  
hello   _comma_   thank you for taking the time to interview me  .  
 hi there    _comma_    i ’ m bill gotcha    _comma_    the owner of gotcha enterprises  .  did you find your way here ok ? 
 your assistant gave wonderful directions  .  
 why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ? 
 our company is moving overseas and i wish to stay in the united states  .  
 what are you best at ? 
 i am good at organizing systems that have been having problems  .  
 what is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ? 
 i don ’ t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy  .  
 that is good to hear ! 
good morning  .  src international  .  how may i help you ? 
 good morning  .  i d like to speak to peter  .  chen please  .  
 certainly  .  who should i say is calling ? 
 this is tim  .  hunter from hunter industries  .  
 and what is it regarding please ? 
 we have an appointment for this afternoon  .  mr  .  chen will know why i m calling  .  
 of course   _comma_   please hold the line mr  .  hunter  .  
right    _comma_    let me run through your options  .  you can go ahead and cash your undue large amount deposit certificate if you really want to    _comma_    but i d recommend a personal durable commodities loan  .  
 ok   _comma_   what does that entail ? 
 it s not too much trouble to do it this way and remember    _comma_    your certificate is due in   months  .  if you can hold on to it    _comma_    it ll be much better for your finances  .  
 yes    _comma_    it does seem a little silly to cash it now  .  i ll probably need about      _comma_       rib  .  will that be a problem ? 
 not at all    _comma_    mr zu  .  as the certificate is due in   months    _comma_    you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate  .  
 i m glad you thought of this  .  i d have just gone ahead and cashed it ! and i suppose i can use the money from the certificate to pay back this personal durable commodities loan and i won t lose any interest   _comma_   right ? 
 exactly right  .  if you d like to go ahead    _comma_    i can process that for you now    _comma_    mr zu  .  
 absolutely    _comma_    jenny  .  thanks very much    _comma_    i think you ve saved me quite a lot of money today  .

 is it good ?

 i think i will try some lobster   _comma_   and give me some green salad together  .  
can ’ t you come in and have tea now   _comma_   peter ? 
 not yet   _comma_   i must water the garden first  .  
 do you have to water it now ? 
 i ’ m afraid i must  .  look at it ! it ’ s terribly dry  .

 last summer it was very dry   _comma_   too  .  don ’ t you remember ? i had to water it every day  .  
 well   _comma_   i ’ ll have tea by myself  .  that was quick ! have you finished already ?

 where do i catch the train ? 
 the trains for cambridge leave from king s cross station  .  they run approximately every half hour  .  most trains to cambridge go from platform    .

 the best way is to take an underground tube train directly to king s cross  .  the underground station is just round the corner from here  .  
 can you show me on the map ? 
 it is very easy  .  just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads  .  the entrance to the underground station is about    meters further on  .

the consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us  .  we have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality i am afraid  .  
 is there anything wrong ? 
 we bought     _comma_       sets of chemical instruments from you    _comma_    but there are    not up to the standard  .  
 it s hard for us to believe it  .  our instruments have been the best quality for years  .  have you any reliable evidence ? 
 here is the survey report from a well known public surveyor in london  .  you may inspect the defective instruments personally 
 well  .  according to the contract   _comma_   we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments  .  we ’ ll send our technicians to repair them  .  
 forty faulty instruments means that   % are not up to the standard  .  you should compensate us for   % of the total account on the contract   _comma_   as well as for the inspection fee  .  
 i am sorry about the quality problem   _comma_   but i propose we compensate you for   % of the total value apart from the inspection fee  .  
 all right  .  in that case we are still willing to do business with you  .  
hi bill   _comma_   i saw your grandma yesterday  .  
 oh where was that ? 
 i was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track  .  
 grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy  .  she is always making us kids eat the proper foods  .  
 well   _comma_   it pays off for her  .  how old is she anyway ? 
 she will be    next month  .  
 that is truly amazing ! 
did you punch in ? 
 yes  .  by the way   _comma_   you are having a great make up today  .  i like the color of your lipstick  .  so adorable ! 
 really ? it took me really a while to find the color  .  i am happy you like it  .  
 well    _comma_    girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things  .  actually    _comma_    do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? 
 sure   _comma_   when those never ending meetings  .  
i don t think you ve met my sister   _comma_   mary  .  
 no   _comma_   i haven t had the pleasure  .  
 come and meet her now  .  
 all right  .  
excuse me   _comma_   would you tell me how to return to hilton hotel  .  i m afraid i lost my way  .  
 did you have hotel card or something ? 
 let me see  .  yes   _comma_   i have the address and hotel telephone number here  .  
 oh    _comma_    you stay at the down town hilton  .  when you go down two blocks this way and turn left    _comma_    you will find it on your right  .  
 i don t understand very well  .  could you give me a map ? 
the bathroom looks lovely  .  did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? 
 i did it myself  .  i went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement  .  then i went to diy shop and bought everything i needed  .  i ’ m sure i saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too  .  i learnt a lot by doing it myself  .  
 so      _comma_      let ’ s see  .  you have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls  .  you ’ ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries  .  the bath      _comma_      shower      _comma_      and washbasin are the same as before      _comma_      aren ’ t they ? 
 yes   _comma_   they are  .  i gave them a good clean  .  they are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced  .  
 how long did it take you to do the tiling  .  
 as i hadn ’ t done it before    _comma_    i had to keep referring to income  ation i got from the internet  .  doing the floor tiles took a whole day from early morning to right through to the evening  .  then i spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles  .  putting the cupboard up took about an hour    _comma_    so it took me two days altogether  .  
 i think you ’ ve done a very good job  .  as least as good as a professional would do  .  perhaps i can convince you to redo my bathroom ? 
 you ’ ll be lucky ! however   _comma_   i ’ ll print out the income  ation i got from the internet and you can do it yourself  .  
i d like to see that pen   _comma_   please  .  
 you mean this one ? 
 no   _comma_   the other one in the brown case  .  
 oh   _comma_   this one  .  here  .  
 may i try it ? 
 sure  .  
 it s very smooth  .  i ll take it  .  
 cash or charge ? 
 charge   _comma_   please  .  
i ’ ve come to hear about your offer for bristles  .  
 we have the offer ready for you  .  let me see  .  here it is  .      cases houston bristles      _comma_         mm      _comma_      at    pounds sterling per kilogram      _comma_      c  .  i  .  f european main ports      _comma_      for shipment in june       .  the offer is valid for five days  .  
 why   _comma_   your price has soared  .  it ’ s almost    % higher than last year ’ s  .  it would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price  .  
 i ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that  .  you know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months  .  the price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere  .  
 i ’ m afraid i can ’ t agree with you there  .  i must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ ve received from other sources  .  
 but you must take the quality into consideration  .  everyone in the trade knows that us ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries  .  
 i agree that yours are of better quality  .  but there ’ s competition from synthetic products   _comma_   too  .  you can ’ t very well ignore that  .  prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years  .  
 there ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses  .  that ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones  .  to be frank with you    _comma_    if it were not for the long   standing relationship between us    _comma_    we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price  .  
 well    _comma_    we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price  .  but i ’ ll have to try    _comma_    i suppose  .

 yes     _comma_     i went to cambridge  .  after graduation     _comma_     i started right away into the advertising industry  .  later     _comma_     i made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research  .  
 so   _comma_   what experience do you have ? 
 i have ten years marketing experience  .  this includes both entry level and management positions  .  in my last position   _comma_   i worked my way up to being director of the marking department  .  
 i can see that from your resume . your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company    _comma_    is that right ? later    _comma_    why did you decide to leave your former post ? 
 i felt after five years in one place     _comma_     i was ready for something new  .  i would like to have a job that is challenging     _comma_     something that i can see and do new things every day  .  i loved many things about my former job     _comma_     and i left with amiable feelings on both sides  .  i was just ready for something new  .  
 i see  .  do you want to work full time or part time ? 
 i would rather work full time  .

my lease ends next month   _comma_   so i have to find a new place  .

 how much do are you looking to spend ? 
 i can only afford about    _comma_      yuan a month  .  
 looks like you ll have to get a place in the suburbs  .  
 it doesn t matter   _comma_   but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route  .  
 anything you need to have in the place ? 
 i want a bedroom with full bath   _comma_   and it ll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side  .  
 you can also check out university bulletin boards  .  
 why ? will those be students who are leaving ? 
 not really   _comma_   but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent  .  
 thank you  .  i ll be sure to take a look  .  
 good luck  .  
excuse me   _comma_   but can i draw on my account for payment of things i buy in china ? 
 certainly   _comma_   sir  .  how much do you draw ? 
 rib     _comma_          _comma_    please  .  would you please tell me my balance ? 
 yes    _comma_    sir  .  your balance is rib      _comma_        .

 that is good  .  and here i give you a piece of advice  .  you should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item  .  besides    _comma_    it s better to secure the cartons with metal straps  .  what s more    _comma_    the order number wasn t anywhere on some of the boxes  .  
 i realize that now  .  i will do that after a while  .  
 thank you  .  can i open the packages to check the color and style ?

hello   _comma_   mr  .  thomas  .  could you spare a minute ? 
 what do you need ? 
 i need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ ve hired  .  i think i am going to have some problems working with him  .  
 he seems to be quite qualified  .  if it is a personal problem i preferred if you would work out between yourselves  .  
i can t stand the stupid guy any longer  .  it   s unbelievable ! 
 oh   _comma_   my dear lady  .  take it easy  .  you should forgive a green hand like him  .  
 he does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy  .  
 i suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems  .  
 i have told him how to do it several times   _comma_   but he s never listened to me  .  
 maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss  .  
 oh   _comma_   i always have difficulty in getting along with the staff  .  
 just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do   _comma_   make sure you don t lose your temper  .  
 i think that s a bad idea  .  i d hate anyone here to think of me as a friend  .  how would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? 
 i disagree  .  all you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions  .  
hey   _comma_   you look great ! how s everything ? 
 yeah   _comma_   you know what ? i ve been going to the club regularly  .  the training really pays off  .  now i am in a good shape and i know more about how to keep fit  .  
 really ? tell me about it  .  i haven t gone to the club for a long time  .  i am too busy with work  .  
 it s important to do proper exercises  .  
 you re right  .  too much or too little won t do any good  .  
 the trainer tells me    _comma_    besides regular sports activities    _comma_    i should also have a healthy and balanced diet  .  
 sounds reasonable  .  
 we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic  .  
 and fruits ! 
 surely it is  .  getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness  .  
 i ve heard that  .  does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ? 
 yeah   _comma_   he advises me to stay in a good mood  .  that can help one to keep sound physical health  .  
 i think if you follow your trainer s advice   _comma_   you ll be on the right track  .  
 you bet it ! 
staying out all night   _comma_   you frightened me to death  .  
 i stayed with my friends  .  
 you should at least give me a call  .  
 i m sorry   _comma_   mum  .  
did anyone call ? 
 just mr  .  white  .  
 what did he want ? 
 he wouldn t say over the phone  .  
what kind of job do you intend to do ? 
 i want to do some management job since i have three year s work history  .  
 what are your plans if you were hired ? 
 i would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company  .  
you stepped on my foot ! 
 sorry  .  i didn t mean to  .  
what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ? 
 while i think it s great that they re trying to get people to quit smoking   _comma_   but i don t really care for the advertisement  .  
 why not ? 
 the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing ! 
 it s a pun  .  they use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking  .  
 i know   _comma_   but i think it s not really appropriate for young children  .  
 i think they re trying to scare the young people so that they don t ever start smoking  .  
 all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty  .  
 perhaps you re right    _comma_       _comma_    though  .  maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow  .  
 i have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults   _comma_   but i don t think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them  .  
 that s a good point  .  i think i was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that i didn t think about how children might understand the ad  .  
 you have to give them credit   _comma_   though  .  it s about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking  .  
good morning  .  could i speak with mr  .  willard please ? 
 this is he  .  who ’ s calling   _comma_   please ? 
 this is chris emerson speaking  .  
 hello   _comma_   chris  .  how can i help you ? 
can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum   _comma_   miss thong ? 
 certainly  .  a letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted  .  a memorandum is a communication within an organization  .  
 should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ? 
 no   _comma_   not necessary  .  usually we have a set form which is printed  .  we just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company  .  
 of course   _comma_   let me find one for you  .  
hi   _comma_   do you have any tickets for the show tonight ?

lily   _comma_   i am terribly sorry about this  .  but we have to put off or cancel tomorrow s meeting  .  
 cancelled ? that s just can t happen ! 
 sorry to say   _comma_   but nothing can be done  .  the equipment broke down and can t be fixed till friday  .  
 oh   _comma_   i hope it be fixed on friday  .  
overseas operator   _comma_   may i help you ? 
 yes  .  i would like to place a collect call  .  
 can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ? 
 terry and his number is            .

 yes   _comma_   we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon  .

 let me see  .  i quoted your delivery in three months   _comma_   didn t i ? 
 yes   _comma_   but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible  .  
 i thought you would be worried about it  .  so i rang auckland last night  .  as you are our biggest customer   _comma_   they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave auckland next month  .  
 good   _comma_   if you agree we ll draft the agreement right away and sign it then  .

 i have no idea  .  what about you ? 
 i kind of want pizza  .  
 i ate pizza the other day  .  
 so   _comma_   what do you feel like eating then ? 
 how about some burgers ? 
 i already had a burger yesterday  .  
 what are we going to do ? 
 we can just each get what we want to get  .  
 that sounds like a plan  .  
 do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ? 
 i think they sell both at the cafeteria  .  
did you bring your certificate for nursing ? 
 yes   _comma_   here is my certificate of nurse  .  
 how about your nursing education ? 
 i learnt nursing through theory and practice for   years at hunan nursing school  .  
 can you manage english conversation ? 
 yes   _comma_   pretty well  .  i have started learning english since primary school  .  
have you ever thought about having children   _comma_   kaitlyn ? 
 my husband and i have thought about it     _comma_     but we ve decided not to have any  .  they re just too expensive  .  besides     _comma_     with all the news about global warming on the news lately     _comma_     who knows what kind of worl 
 well    _comma_    i ve always wanted to have lots of children  .  growing up with only one brother    _comma_    i always felt a bit lonely  .  what do you think about families with only one child ? 
 for me   _comma_   growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention  .  i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn t ever have to share  .  
 don t you think you would miss having other people around ? 
 no way ! i spent    years of my life with relatives around me       .  you know   _comma_   i don t think i ve ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents   home  .  what do you think fo the one child policy 
 if china didn t have such a policy   _comma_   can you imagine how many people there would be in china now ? 
 that s true  .  but as a woman     _comma_     i m glad that even though i don t want any children     _comma_     i at least have a choice in how many children i have  .  on the other hand     _comma_     i can t imagine what china would be like 
 do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? 
 i don t know what other people think     _comma_     but i     _comma_     for one     _comma_     envy only children ! 
ok   _comma_   let ’ s go through this one more time  .  i don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! 
 i know    _comma_    i know  .  ok    _comma_    so i have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine  .  
 right  .  you have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing  .  for example for delicates    _comma_    you should set a shorter washing cycle  .  also    _comma_    be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing  .  
 so complicated ! ok   _comma_   what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ? 
 since this is a white t shirt   _comma_   you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick  .  
 cool  .  then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? 
 no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton   _comma_   you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes  .  
 you know what ? i ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned  .  
is tom in ? 
 no   _comma_   he is at work now  .  
 may i have his office phone number please ? 
 sure  .  it s      _comma_        .  
what about driving to shanghai ? 
 driving ? no way   _comma_   it s too far  .  
 i just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places  .  how long will it take ? 
 too long   _comma_   and you do not have much time  .  
 what a pity  .  
good afternoon  .  i ll show you to your room  .  
 thank you  .  
 could you tell me which bags are yours ? 
 they re over there next to the door  .  those three with green tags on them  .

 let me see  .  i am sorry   _comma_   sir  .  we will change another one for you  .  please wait a moment  .  
excuse me   _comma_   but could you tell me the way to the railway station ? 
 the railway station ? just go down this street and turn left at the second corner  .  the station is at the end of that street  .  
 how long will it take me to get there ? 
 it s about a ten minute walk  .  
 that s very clear  .  i think i can find my way now  .  thank you  .  
 not at all  .  
excuse me ! does this bus go to the railway station ? 
 no   _comma_   you re got on the wrong bus  .  you can take a no  .     bus at the university station and then transfer to a no  .     bus at the railway station  .  
 ok ! thank you very much ! 
i have here our price sheet on a f  .  o  .  b  .  basis  .  the prices are given without engagement  .  
 good    _comma_    if you ’ ll excuse me    _comma_    i ’ ll go over the sheet right now  .  
 take your time  .  
 i can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high  .  
 i ’ m surprised to hear you say so  .  you know that the cost of pro   duction has been skyrocketing in recent years  .  
 we only ask that your prices be comparable to others  .  that ’ s reasonable   _comma_   isn ’ t it ? 
 well      _comma_      to get the business done      _comma_      we can consider making some concessions in our price  .  but first      _comma_      you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us      _comma_      so that we may adjust our prices accordingly  .  
 the size of our order depends greatly on the prices  .  let ’ s settle that matter first  .  
 well     _comma_     as i ’ ve said     _comma_     if your order is large enough     _comma_     we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by   percent  .  
 when i say your prices are much too high   _comma_   i don ’ t mean they are higher merely by   or   percent  .  
 how much do you mean then ? can you give me a rough idea ? 
 to have this business concluded   _comma_   i should say a reduction of least    percent would help  .  
 impossible  .  how can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? 
 i think you are as well   informed as i am about the market for chemical fertilizers  .  it ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup   ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet  .  may i suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? 
 very well   _comma_   i will  .  
excuse me   _comma_   you look lost . can i help you ? 
 oh   _comma_   thank you  .  i m looking for the train station  .  
 right  .  let me see  .  you go straight down here and turn right  .  
 right ? ok   _comma_   got it  .  
 then take the next left then the next right  .  are you with me ? 
 next left then right ? ok  .  
i m sorry   _comma_   but i didn t catch what you said  .  
 i said   _comma_     do you want me to help you ?   
 i m trying to find a post office  .  
 go three blocks and turn right  .  it s right there  .  
 should i take the bus ? 
 no  .  it ll only take about five minutes to walk  .  
 thank you very much  .  
 anytime  .

 but i want to be a tour guide very much because i like traveling and meeting various kinds of people  .  so i took an evening course at the tourism school of beijing after graduation and i have gotten a qualification certificate  .  
 so you must be an extravert ? 
 yes   _comma_   i always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them  .  
 what do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ? 
 a tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities      _comma_      and offering service of transportation      _comma_      accommodation      _comma_      sightseeing      _comma_      shopping and entertainment  .  
 don t you consider it a hard work ? 
 hard but interesting   _comma_   i think  .  
 have you any experience as a tourist guide ? 
 yes   _comma_   i usually guided foreign tourists around beijing when i was in university  .  
 have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than english ? 
 yes   _comma_   i have learned a little french and japanese as well  .  
didn ’ t you punch in this morning   _comma_   monica ? 
 sorry   _comma_   i don ’ t know the rule about punching  .  
 that ’ s ok  .  i should have told you earlier  .  this is a company rule  .  
 do we also need to punch out after work ? 
 according to the company rule   _comma_   we should punch in before   o ’ clock and punch out after   o ’ clock every work day  .  
 how about the lunch break   _comma_   lucy ? 
 from    thirty to   o ’ clock  .  
 may i ask whether we need to work overtime ? 
 sometimes   _comma_   but not quite often  .  
this needs dry cleaning . can you remove this stain without harming the fabric ? 
 let me see  .  we ’ ll try   _comma_   but i ’ m not sure that we can remove it  .  
 ok   _comma_   then  .  we ’ ll i ’ d also like to have this pressed  .

 no   _comma_   not really  .  
 you re lucky there was no lasting damage  .  i ll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days  .  we ll take those stitches out then  .  so long  .  
 thank you   _comma_   doctor  .  bye  .  
what time is it ? 
 ten to nine  .  
 your watch is ten minutes slow  .  so it s should be nine sharp  .  i m gonna be late again  .  what will be my excuse this time ? it should be set the alarm for seven thirty  .  
 don t cry over spilled milk   _comma_   fred ? could you stay with me a few minutes ? 
 what ? why ? what s wrong with you ? 
 i just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking . it   s so lonely and boring  .  my sickness makes it worse  .  when will i recover ? 
 you will be fine in the couple of month    _comma_    just be patient  .  i ve got to woke now    _comma_    i ll be late  .

 that ’ s just what i want to know  .  
 he told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me  .

good afternoon    _comma_    sir  .  you re here to see about a temporary loan    _comma_    right ? the loans we offer are for purchasing income generating assets  .  is that what you require ? 
 yes   _comma_   that s exactly what i need  .  how about terms for these ? 
 well   _comma_   we offer      day or      day loans  .  the balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period  .  
 is there any flexibility on that ? 
 unfortunately   _comma_   not  .  
 ok  .  in my position   _comma_   i think the best way to go would be for the      day loan  .  that would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan  .  
 not a problem     _comma_     sir  .  if you d just fill out these forms     _comma_     and of course with necessary clearance     _comma_     we can get you the money right away  .

 sure   _comma_   do you have the receipt ? 
 yeah here you go  .  actually i also want to return this keyboard  .  
 ok  .  may i ask what is the reason for returning these products ? 
 the tv flickers a lot when i am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear  .  
 i see   _comma_   and what about the keyboard ? 
 i spilled some coffee on it and now it won t work  .  
 i am sorry mam    _comma_    but we can only exchange or refund defective products    _comma_    we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages  .  
 fine ! i don t know why they make these things so delicate anyways  .  
there are so many people that the tickets are all sold out ! 
 luckily we got the last two  .  
 look   _comma_   danny  .  the four great inventions ! 
 gunpowder     _comma_     compass     _comma_     the paper making     _comma_     and the printing  .  
 i really admire those who made such great inventions ! 
 may   _comma_   i don t see why they are great  .  they are just simple things  .  
 they look simple today  .  but they were milestones in their times  .  
 milestones ? may   _comma_   you must be kidding  .  
 just think bill gates   _comma_   those inventions are as important as the windows system  .  
 well   _comma_   i suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them  .  
 no   _comma_   quite the contrary  .  
 why ? didn t you say that they were milestones ? 
 yes   _comma_   but they went to the public without any patent protection  .  
 well   _comma_   their inventors were not as clever as bill gates  .  
what can i do for you ? 
 i need some medicine  .  
 for whom ? 
 my wife  .  she suffers from a bad cold  .  
 what symptoms does she have ? 
 fever and a bad cough  .  
 i see  .  don t worry   _comma_   just a common cold  .  
 what kind of medicine does she need ? 
 patulin will be enough  .  
 how many pills for each time ?

 thank you very much  .  
 it s my pleasure  .  
do you believe in god ? 
 not at all  .  i ’ m an agnostic  .  do you ? 
 i ’ m not sure  .  why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? 
 i think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one  .  
 i basically believe in science over theology  .  i mean    _comma_    i believe in evolution for example  .  however    _comma_    there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet  .  
 i ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually  .  i think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong  .  
 for example ? 
 religions preach tolerance   _comma_   but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics  .  
 yes  .  such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs  .  
didn t you say your friend was american ? where is she going on her honeymoon ? 
 they re going skiing in colorado  .  
 what a coincidence ! these pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon ! 
 you re probably right  .  oh    _comma_    what the heck ! i ll take it all  .  in maroon    _comma_    like you said  .  
what a terrible house ! 
 i m sick of it   _comma_   too  .  
 the door bell doesn t work    _comma_    there s no hot water    _comma_    and the building is falling apart  .  
 it s no use complaining  .  if we had got enough money    _comma_    we couldn t put up with it    _comma_    and would have moved out  .  
 sure  .  
hello ! 
 is that sue ?

 certainly i will    _comma_    mr  .  robbins  .  by the way    _comma_    may i use a window envelope ? 
 yes      _comma_      that s fine  .  now when you finish these      _comma_      i want you to put these cards in alphabetical order      _comma_      using the last names      _comma_      and then make a list  .  
 you want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ? 
 right  .  and the last thing   _comma_   we are going to clean the files out tomorrow  .  now let s begin  .  
you re finally here ! what took so long ? 
 i got stuck in traffic again  .  there was a terrible traffic jam near the carrefour intersection  .  
 it s always rather congested down there during rush hour  .  maybe you should try to find a different route to get home  .  
 i don t think it can be avoided   _comma_   to be honest  .  
 perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work  .  
 i think it s something that i ll have to consider  .  the public transport system is pretty good  .  
 it would be better for the environment   _comma_   too  .  
 i know  .  i feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city  .  
 taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well  .  
 the only problem is that i m going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car  .  
 well    _comma_    when it s nicer outside    _comma_    you can start biking to work  .  that will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides  .  
 that s true  .  i could certainly use the exercise ! 
 so   _comma_   are you going to quit driving to work then ? 
 yes   _comma_   it s not good for me or for the environment  .  
that s really convenient  .  we were wondering if you could take a little off the rent   _comma_   though  .  
 i can take two thousand off  .  that ll make the rent twenty eight thousand  .  
 that s great  .  every little bit counts  .  and we don t need the parking space  .  i guess we could rent it out  .  
 sure   _comma_   for at least three thousand per month  .  
 that ll bring the price down to twenty five  .  that s the price we were shooting for  .  
 i m glad  .  now   _comma_   there s a deposit fee of two month s rent  .  
hello  .  i sent out my laundry yesterday . aren   t they ready ? 
 they ll be ready by this afternoon  .  
 oh   _comma_   no ! i m leaving for japan at    this morning  .  
 is that right ? we re very sorry  .  
 i thought it was   the same day   service . anyway   _comma_   please do hurry  .  
 i m afraid we can t return it by    o clock  .  
 well     _comma_     then     _comma_     would you send it to japan     _comma_     please ? 
 yes   _comma_   we ll do so  .  
hello   _comma_   welcome to lincoln bank  .  what can we do for you today ? 
 i want to effect payment under an l   c today  .  
 no problem  .  ok  .  just checking for you  .  ah    _comma_    i m afraid there aren t enough funds in your account to cover this transaction  .  what you can do is buy some us dollars    _comma_    using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount  .  
 that seems alright  .  what s the exchange rate like today ? good or bad ? 
 it s not too bad today   _comma_   actually  .      .     .  
how can i help you   _comma_   sir ? 
 i am here to have a discussion on your company s investment issue  .  
 sorry   _comma_   could you tell me your name ? 
 i am james pond from fam company and i am here to discuss it with nova  .  
 do you have an appointment ? 
 yes   _comma_   i did it yesterday  .  our meeting should be   pm  .  
 i guess she forgot your meeting  .  she is attending an important meeting in the company  .  will you have a seat ? may i leave a memo for her ? 
 thank you  .  
 she will be back soon  .  
excuse me  .  would you please make a suit with this material ? 
 sure  .  may i take your measurements ? 
 please don t make it too tight  .  this is for autumn wear   _comma_   so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath  .  
 i see    _comma_    sir  .  can you come back for a fitting on the   th    _comma_    that s in a week s time ? 
 the   th ? i m sorry     _comma_     but you see i m going to attend an international conference on the   th  .  could you have the suit ready by the  th     _comma_     or at the latest     _comma_     the  th ? 
 well    _comma_    a business suit usually takes ten days   time  .  but in your case    _comma_    we ll try to have it ready sooner  .  how about coming for your fitting on the  th ? then your suit will be ready for you on the   th ? 
 that s fine   _comma_   thank you  .  
good morning everyone  .  thank you for attending the meeting today  .  i m sure you all have a copy of the agenda  .  so let s get started with the first issue  .  
 we re here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior  .  
 i would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right )      _comma_      we have mr  .  brown      _comma_      who is vice president of sales  .  next to him is ms  .  arts      _comma_      director of marketing for the atlas company  .  in the back row is dr  .  barolo      _comma_      who is visiting from italy  .  thank you all for coming  .  
 i am glad to see everyone is here and on time  .  let s get started ! susan   _comma_   toss out some of your ideas  .  
it seems that many boys are fighting there  .  
 break it up ! i will not permit fighting in this campus  .  
the air quality in this city is horrendous ! the pollution levels were so high that we weren t supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! 
 exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment  .  
 on top of that    _comma_    there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs    _comma_    which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city  .  
 as much as i love this city   _comma_   i think i m going to have to find a greener city to live in  .  living in a polluted city like this just can t be good for my health  .  
 i know what you mean  .  however      _comma_      there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming  .  if it s not the pollution      _comma_      then it s the natural disasters      _comma_      deforestation      _comma_      or the greenhouse 
 what is the greenhouse effect exactly ? 
 it s the gradual rise in the earth s temperature  .  
 i see   _comma_   so it s similar to global warming ? 
 they re related to one another   _comma_   yes  .  
 i heard that some people in england are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it s making their towns a more pleasant place to live  .  
 people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature   _comma_   but it s not all good news  .  they ve been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well  .  
 people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations  .  
 i think if everyone pitches in   _comma_   the world will be a better place  .  
would you like some cookies ? i just made them  .  
 thank you  .  yes   _comma_   i would  .  
 these are chocolate   _comma_   and those are almond flavored  .  
 i guess i ll try a chocolate one first . mmmm  .  this is delicious . are they hard to make ? 
 no     _comma_     they re really quite easy  .  wait a minute     _comma_     i ve got the recipe right here . see  .  these are the ingredients     _comma_     and then you just follow the directions  .  
 that does look easy  .  i think i ll make some tonight  .  
can i help you ? 
 i d like to buy a ticket to casablanca on flight us    tomorrow  .  
 hold on   _comma_   plese . it will take off at   :   tomorrow . the price is        .

 i am sorry sir  .  we won t give any discount in busy seasons . the price is the same  .  
how do you use an atm card   _comma_   billy ? 
 it ’ s easy grandpa  .  insert you card into the machine here  .  then wait a moment  .  ok  .  now you enter your pin  .  it should have four numbers  .  
 oh yes  .  i ’ ve got it written down here  .  just a minute  .  
 you really shouldn ’ t write it down  .  you should memorise it  .  you can change it to a more convenient number if you like  .  
 ok    _comma_    i ’ ve entered my pin  .  there are several options on the screen  .  i guess i just choose which service i want    _comma_    don ’ t i ? 
 yes  .  choose the service you need to use  .  if you choose to withdraw money   _comma_   the machine will ask you how much you want  .  
 i can just enter the amount using the key   _comma_   right ? 
 that ’ s right  .  give the machine a moment to process you request  .  then take your money  .  
 these machines aren ’ t very difficult to use  .  in fact   _comma_   i quite like them  .  they are much faster than dealing with a band clerk  .  
hello   _comma_   is jennifer in ? 
 i am sorry   _comma_   you have the wrong number  .  
 oh   _comma_   i am really sorry  .  
can you give me a hand with the dishes ?

 well    _comma_    i go jogging every morning    _comma_    eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week  .  
 wow   _comma_   it sounds like a lot of work  .  i guess i m too lazy to do all that  .  
bob from accounting is on the line  .  do you want to speak with him ? 
 yes   _comma_   i need to talk to him  .  
 i ll put the call through then  .  
 thank you  .  
i want to send some money to australia  .  could you handle it for me ? 
 yes    _comma_    madam    _comma_    how much would you like to remit ? 
    _comma_      ad    .  
 which would you like to remit   _comma_   by mail or by cable ? 
 what is the difference between them ? 
 the cable will take less time for your account    _comma_    in the meantime    _comma_    the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one  .  
 well   _comma_   i think the cable is better  .  
 ok    _comma_    please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary    _comma_    your name and telephone  .  
 all right  .  here you are  .  
 everything is ok  .  the commission is    yuan  .  
 here you are  .  thanks a lot  .  
kate   _comma_   can we change the channel ? 
 why ? 
 this channel has so many advertisements   _comma_   and it doesn t have any good tv programs  .  
 ok  .  you can change it  .  
 what about this one ? do you like this program ? 
 no    _comma_    i think it is very boring  .  can you change it to channel twelve    _comma_    please ?

 thanks a billion  .  
every honored guests   _comma_   welcome to hang thou  .  now we are visiting tiger running spring  .  
 how can we relate tiger to this spot   _comma_   miss zhang ? 
 its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole   _comma_   and then a spring gushed out from it  .  
 how ignorant i am ! 
 the longing tea and the tiger running spring water are always considered as the “ two wonders in west lake  .  ” 
 i know that tea  .  it smells fragrant  .  
 that s right  .  all my guests   _comma_   attention please  .  we will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos  .  and next spot will be the moon reflected in three pools  .

 that doesn t sound pretty  .  
 do you have any plans for tomorrow ? 
 well   _comma_   i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends  .  
 you might want to change your plans  .  with the cold and wet weather that we re supposed to have tomorrow   _comma_   the roads are going to be rather slippery  .  
 i suppose i should  .  i don t like driving in dangerous weather conditions  .  do you have any plans for tomorrow ? 
 i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon  .

 that sounds like fun  .  
 hey   _comma_   look outside ! it s started to drizzle ! 
 english weather is even more predictable than i had previously thought  .  
can you tell me what s included in your warranty ? 
 certainly  .  the product has a two year guarantee  .  if it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge  .  our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty  .  this covers you for a further two years  .  
 i see  .  what does that include ? 
 it covers all parts and labour   _comma_   except for normal wear and tear of course  .  
 what sort of response time do you guarantee ? 
 our engineers are on call    hours a day  .  we guarantee someone will be with you within four hours   _comma_   but in practice it s often much sooner  .  
 are there any exclusions ? 
 not really  .  it s a very comprehensive warranty  .  i ’ ll put a copy in the post to you and you can read through the small print  .  
do you have any particular conditions that you would like our company to take into consideration ?

 i always have the temptation to eat something there  .  
 then   _comma_   why didn t you do that ? 
 i don t know how much we can trust them  .  do you have any ideas ? 
 some of them    _comma_    i think    _comma_    are not good  .  
 it doesn t taste good ? 
 no   _comma_   i mean some of them are not clean enough  .  
 that s my greatest concern  .  but how can you tell which one is clean ? 
 i judge by appearances  .  
 i got it  .  i think it s worth trying  .  
 it certainly is  .  
 i d like to try some kebab    _comma_    roasted squid    _comma_    and many different appealing things  .

 alright  .  what if i can ’ t get a hold of them by phone ? 
 then   _comma_   you should e mail them with the information  .  
 where can i find their e mail addresses ? 
 they should have then listed on their resumes  .  
 and if there aren ’ t any e mail addresses ? 
 then send them a sms on their cell phone  .  
 ok  .  that sounds easy enough  .  have you called any of them yet ? 
 yes  .  i called the first three people on the list   _comma_   but they didn ’ t pick up  .  
 did you leave a voice message ? 
 i left a voice message on one   just for the first person on the list  .  
 i see  .  what did you tell her ? 
 i told her that she should call me back at my office number  .  
 ok    _comma_    so    _comma_    maybe i should call her again  .  
 yes   _comma_   that sounds like a good idea  .  she might not get the other message in time  .  
 one more question  .  it looks like some of these numbers are long distance  .  do you have a calling card that i can use to get through to them ?

the environment varies greatly because of difference in language   _comma_   customs and traditions  .  
 yes  .  this gap can be filled by export market research before exporting  .  
 but the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers  .  
 that s right  .  they do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury  .  
 therefore    _comma_    when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market    _comma_    they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount  .  
 exactly ! 
hello   _comma_   i really appreciate the opportunity to interview for this position  .

 well   _comma_   the yearly interest rate is   .    % for   years  .  i m sure you are qualified to apply for this loan  .  
 what about the loan repayment ? 
 you may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank    _comma_    for example    _comma_    payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments  .  
 does that mean i should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ? 
 exactly  .  you are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank  .  
 that s very thoughtful of you  .  thank you so much  .  
 you re welcome  .  
you really need to look at some of the problems we are having with the apartment  .  
 that apartment never had any problems before  .  are you sure the problem isn ’ t you ? 
 we spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix  .  
 where do you think you have problems ? 
 there is no hot water    _comma_    the bedroom has a broken window    _comma_    and there are rats in the kitchen  .  
 you know   _comma_   no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before  .

 oh   _comma_   i like the music on your radio  .  it s nice  .

 but i don t speak english at all  .  
 that s ok  .  the program is especially for the beginners like us  .  
 really ? when is it on ? 
 it begins at  :   every morning   _comma_   and it goes for    minutes  .  
 thank you so much  .  i ll try and catch that  .  
 the radio has brought us lots of convenience  .

i ’ m thinking about getting a pet   _comma_   but i ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable  .  could you give me some advice ? 
 certainly ! the first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet  .  dogs are very demanding  .  you need to take them for walks and they love to play  .  cats    _comma_    on the other hand    _comma_    are more independent  .  
 i ’ m fairly busy       _comma_       so i really need an animal that i don ’ t need to care of very much  .  actually       _comma_       i ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual  .  i don t ’ really want a typical pet       _comma_       like a cat       _comma_       dog       _comma_       or hamster  .  do you have any suggestions ? 
 unusual pet are often more expensive to keep  .  is that a problem ? 
 not really  .  by the way    _comma_    i don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous    _comma_    like a tarantula or rattlesnake  .  
 we have those      _comma_      but i only sell them to people i know well      _comma_      for obvious reasons  .  how about a lizard ? i have some that are very brightly coloured      _comma_      are not aggressive      _comma_      and are easy to feed and look after  .  
 that sounds ideal  .  could you show me some ? 
 sure  .  come over here  .  as you can see    _comma_    i have a wide selection of species  .  they can live together    _comma_    if you want lizards of different kinds  .  do you have a favourite colour ? 
 i like the red one  .  what do they eat ? 
 you can feed them on various things  .  they will eat small pieces of meat    _comma_    but i ’ d recommend insects  .  you can get them from your garden    _comma_    but remember that lizards eat a lot insects  .  i sell them here  .  
 thanks a lot  .  what i ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week  .

 i ’ ve researched the company and think i ’ m perfect for the job but i ’ m not sure how to get it across to them  .  
 well first you have to have more confidence . employers look for people who are interested   _comma_   enthusiastic and sure of themselves  .  
 i know i have what it takes but im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient  .  should i inflate my experience ? 
 no    _comma_    you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses  .  however by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities    _comma_    you can take the attention 
after i am accepted for unemployment benefits   _comma_   what will happen next ?

dad   _comma_   i ’ d like to borrow some money  .  
 sure    _comma_    johnny    _comma_    how much do you need ? five bucks ? 
 come on       _comma_       dad       _comma_       i need thirty thousand  .  i wanna get into the market  .  you know       _comma_       i ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn       _comma_       the inevitable recession       _comma_       people stuffing their money in their mattresses  .  i look at this as an opportunity  .  this is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg  .  
 i don ’ t know about that . with all the uncertainty in the markets right now     _comma_     it would be a very unwise decision to invest  .  i don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son     _comma_     but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently  .  there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months     _comma_     and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy  .  there ’ s just too much instability  .  i wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate  .  
 but look at it this way       _comma_       every challenge is an opportunity . and anyway       _comma_       i ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market  .  there are emerging markets that promise great returns  .  look at china       _comma_       for example . they have   .   billion people       _comma_       half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class  .  here alone       _comma_       the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity  .  
 come on      _comma_      son      _comma_      you ’ re looking at this too naively      _comma_      the chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability      _comma_      and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point  .  
 fine    _comma_    then ! if that ’ s the way you feel    _comma_    so be it  .  but you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here  .  i ’ m going to go hit up mum for the cash  .  
could you tell me a little about the organization ? for example   _comma_   how big is your workforce here ? 
 well in total we have around     employees based in hong kong with another     in our head office in beijing  .  the news desk staff in hong kong comprises around    staff  .  
 i see  .  and how about the working hours ? 
 well    _comma_    as you know rebecca    _comma_    in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five  .  you could be on call at any time  .  we do have to work very unsociable hours at times  .  
 well i am used to that    _comma_    mr  .  parsons    _comma_    so that ’ s not really a shock for me  .  
 good   _comma_   as long as you understand that  .  
 and when do you need to fill the vacancy   _comma_   mr  .  parsons ? 
 yesterday ! but no   _comma_   we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month  .  
 that sounds ideal  .  
smells good ! what ’ s for breakfast ? 
 well    _comma_    since we are getting up so late    _comma_    i decided to make a big breakfast ! 
 nice ! brunch ! 
 kind of    _comma_    so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs    _comma_    some french toast and buttermilk pancakes ! 
 wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ? 
 yeah   _comma_   just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light  .  
 looks good ! i ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice  .  
 get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don ’ t forget the syrup ! 
come on   _comma_   fellows  .  let s enjoy my wife s cooking ! 
 em   _comma_   it s delicious !

 thank you very much  .  
 you ’ re welcome  .

 very interesting  .  thank you for bringing it to us  .  
 are you interested in making this investment ? 
 we haven t decided yet   _comma_   we will let you know if we do  .  
david   _comma_   how is your interview ? 
 i was nervous at that time  .  what about you ? 
 just fine  .  i tried to answer every question raised by hr carefully  .  i found some answering skills are useful  .  these questions are different from exams  .  
 we can have a rest now after this tough interview  .  
 don t be rush  .  it is suggested to write a letter for the personnel department of future clothes company  .  
 sounds like a good idea  .  and i think this can leave deep impression to hr  .  how can we write a suitable letter ? 
 just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company  .  and you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you  .  
 i am getting to know your meaning  .  
good morning    _comma_    i made an appointment with dr  .  smith    _comma_    but i have to change it  .  
 when you made your appointment   _comma_   what day did you choose ? 
 my appointment was on wednesday  .  
 at what time was that appointment ? 
 it was for   
 i can see the appointment that you had  .  what day do you need to change to ? 
 i want to change to next tuesday  .  
 what time would you prefer ? 
 i would prefer three o ’ clock in the afternoon  .  
 i will put you down for that time  .  thank you for calling to reschedule  .  
can i help you ? 
 en    _comma_    i am looking for a porter    _comma_    do you know where i can find one ? 
 there are so many here . the men with red hats are the porters  .  
 what s the charge ? 
 well   _comma_   it depends how many pieces of luggages you have  .  
 thank you  .  
have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? 
 yes   _comma_   not bad  .  like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co workers  .  
 well     _comma_     but for this one     _comma_     don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings     _comma_     i think it is not reasonable  .  what if there are some important calls ? 
 well   _comma_   this one is not compulsory  .  it is just suggestion  .  
 i didn ’ t pay attention to that  .  
do you think we should travel by bus or by train ? 
 it s a difficult choice . the train is a little faster   _comma_   but much more expensive  .  
 we could face delays if we travel by bus   _comma_   thanks to traffic jams  .  
 buses are more cramps and you can t walk around  .  
 that s true . but i feel that i see more when i travel by bus  .  
 really ? i think you see more traveling by train  .  
 so which form of transport do you prefer to use ? 
 i prefer going by train   _comma_   even though it costs more  .  
 ok   _comma_   then we ll go by train  .  i m sure we ll have a good journey . shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ? 
 the trains aren t usually full . we can get them on the day we travel . we should buy return tickets   _comma_   because they are much cheaper than getting   singles  .  
 we should take a packed lunch on the journey . the food they sell on the trains is always expensive  .  
did you hear about lulu ? 
 no   _comma_   what ? 
 she and vic broke up and now she ’ s asked for a transfer  .  
 get out of here ! i didn ’ t even know they were dating ! 
 no one really did  .  they were very discreet and professional at the office  .  
here s a model of our latest design  .  what do you think of it ? 
 well   _comma_   i m not too happy about it  .  
 what s wrong with it ? 
 well   _comma_   i m afraid it s not at all what i wanted  .  you haven t really followed my instructions . it   ll have to be done again  .  
 oh   _comma_   dear ! 
hello   _comma_   this is the international youth hotel  .  how can i help you ? 
 oh   _comma_   yes  .  i want to check whether you still have any vacancies  .  i need three single rooms for next monday  .  
 ok  .  there re vacancies  .  since the peak season is coming   _comma_   it s advisable to book soon  .  would you like to make a reservation now ? 
 yes   _comma_   please  .  do you take credit cards ? 
 yes   _comma_   we accept all major credit cards  .  
 and how about internet access ? 
 there s free internet access in the lobby  .  
 is it available in the rooms ? 
 unfortunately not  .  
 that s ok  .  is breakfast included ? 
 yes   _comma_   breakfast is included and parking is available  .  
 fantastic  .  thank you very much  .  
 you re welcome  .  and we have    hour reception  .  please don t hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions  .  
i have been very busy this year    _comma_    working late    _comma_    often taking work home and taking no vacation  .  i feel exhausted  .  
 you should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit  .  you worked so hard  .  
 you are right  .  for the past few weeks   _comma_   i had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well  .  what ’ s worse my back started aching this monday  .  it is time for me to take a vacation  .  
what sort of shopping is nearby   _comma_   mr  .  taylor ? 
 call me john  .  this is a great area of the city for shopping  .  there ’ s a grocery store just around the corner  .  
 what about things other than food ? 
 well    _comma_    the riverside mall has     stores in it    _comma_    including four major department stores  .  
 are there small shops near here as well ? 
 yes     _comma_     on  th street     _comma_     near the movie theater there are many specialty shops     _comma_     including clothing boutiques  .  
 well   _comma_   that sounds just wonderful  .  
 yes   _comma_   it ’ s a really nice neighborhood  .  
now darling    _comma_    i know that we ve bought this house together    _comma_    but it s just going to be far too expensive to decorate it  .  i think we should sell it  .  
 oh       _comma_       no       _comma_       nathan       _comma_       i  .  i really think we ve bought this flat at the right time       _comma_       you know . market prices are going to go up       _comma_       and i think you ll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more  .  
 but we re going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating  .  i think we could get a much cheaper place that s already furnished  .  
 but don t you like this place ? i remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely  .  
 well    _comma_    only you liked it really    _comma_    darling  .  
 oh   _comma_   why didn t you say so then ? but i still think we ve made a good buy  .  
hi    _comma_    bob    _comma_    everything okay ? 
 more or less  .  there s just one thing bothering me  .  
 oh ? what s that ? 
 well   _comma_   you know i have some students studying for their master s degree  .  one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy  .  
 what gift ? 
 it s an egyptian carpet  .  the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude  .  seeing what gift was    _comma_    i was really uncomfortable  .  i mean it s too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor  .  i don t think i ve done anything to deserve that gift    _comma_    so i refused it  .  
 you refused the gift ? that s terrible  .  
 i know    _comma_    but i really can t accept such an expensive gift  .  i explained to him why    _comma_    but he seemed really upset about it  .  i think he might have taken it the wrong way  .  
 perhaps  .  he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade  .  
 that s what i am worried about  .  i do understand the respect attached with the gift and i am honored  .  but i really don t think it s proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor  .  i think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page  .  
i ve been looking for a swimming pool   _comma_   but i haven t found one yet  .  
 we have no pool    _comma_    sir    _comma_    but we do have swim stations in our gym  .  
 swim stations ? could you be a little more explicit ? 
 you know how you run on a treadmill but don t go anywhere ? well   _comma_   it s the same thing  .  
 gee    _comma_    that s a great idea  .  now    _comma_    how much do i have to pay ? 
 the stations are absolutely free to guests   _comma_   sir  .  
 great ! now   _comma_   when can i go down there and use the stations ? 
 the swim stations are open daily from   a  .  m  .  to    p  .  m  .  
 boy   _comma_   oh boy ! i can t wait to change into my swim trunks  .  
 be warned   _comma_   sir  .  at certain hours the swim stations are very crowded  .  
hi  .  today   _comma_   i am the interviewer for your visa application  .  
 ok  .  here is my application form and all the documents  .

 ok  .  do you plan to go to america all by yourself or with your family ? 
 myself  .  
 have you finished all you preparation ? 
 yes  .  everything is ready  .  
what a pity you are leaving so soon  .  i wish you could stay a few more days  .  sir   _comma_   can you deliver a speech for us ? 
 dear friends  .  here      _comma_      i wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send off party for me  .  actually i didn t expect at all for this  .  i owe a lot to all of you here  .  it s been   days since i came to visit here  .  time really flies  .  i feel grateful for your welcome and help in the five days  .  i will miss you while i am leaving  .  let s keep in touch in any way  .  what s more      _comma_      to the success of our face to face meeting      _comma_      to the upcoming cooperation of our two companies      _comma_      bottom up !

 how many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ? 
 we have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home  .  
 do you need to be located in a particular school district ? 
 it doesn ’ t matter   _comma_   as we do not have any children  .  
 is a view important to you   _comma_   or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ? 
 in a perfect world   _comma_   we would like a home with a view of the lake  .

 well       _comma_       it s small       _comma_       but it s a young       _comma_       dynamic       _comma_       rapidly growing company with a progressive       _comma_       humanistic philosophy  .

i really want to make something for dinner  .  
 what are you going to cook ? 
 i haven t the slightest clue what i m going to make  .  
 a teriyaki bowl sounds nice  .  
 i don t know how to make that  .  
 all you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef  .  
 that sounds fairly simple   _comma_   but how do i cook it ? 
 the first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice  .  
 what s next ? 
 then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it  .  
 what s the next thing i need to do ? 
 then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy  .  
how do i submit an expense report ? 
 you need all your receipts for reimbursement  .

good morning  .  madam  .  what can i do for you today ? 
 hello  .  i hope you can help me ; i m a little worried about my new card  .  
 what seems to be the problem ? 
 i received my new card this morning   _comma_   but i m unable to use it  .  
 oh ? you mean   _comma_   the atm machine has eaten it ? 
 no    _comma_    it s right here    _comma_    see ? the atm will not accept it ! 
 you said you received your card this morning   _comma_   am i right ? 
 yes  .  i was told it would be activated and ready to use right away  .  so   _comma_   what s gone wrong ? 
 did you receive your pin number yet        _comma_        madam ? you see        _comma_        unless you have your new pin number        _comma_        to match your new card        _comma_        you cannot use it  .  we usually send that separately        _comma_        around one day after the card        _comma_        for security reasons  .  
 well   _comma_   that explains it  .  i ve been using my old pin number ! thanks for explaining everything to me  .  
can you manage chopsticks ? 
 why not ? see  .  
 good mastery  .  how do you like our chinese food ? 
 oh     _comma_     great ! it s delicious  .  you see     _comma_     i am already putting on weight  .  there is one thing i don t like however     _comma_     msg  .  
 what s wrong with msg ? it helps to bring out the taste of the food  .  
 according to some studies it may cause cancer  .  
 oh    _comma_    don t let that worry you  .  if that were true    _comma_    china wouldn t have such a large population  .  
 i just happen to have a question for you guys  .  why do the chinese cook the vegetables ? you see what i mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated  .  
 i don t know exactly  .  it s a tradition  .  maybe it s for sanitary reasons  .  
hi    _comma_    francis    _comma_    how was your business trip ? 
 it was a nightmare  .  
 what ’ s up ? 
 actually    _comma_    the business trip itself was very successful  .  we arrived on time    _comma_    we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year  .  
 sounds quite fruitful   _comma_   why do you call it still a nightmare then ? 
 well    _comma_    the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then i lost my carry on bag when i was tackling with the officers in charge  .  i left the airport three hours later than i expected and then i was caught in a traffic jam  .  when i finally got home    _comma_    i was totally exhausted  .  but i found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout  .  
 this is really a sad story  .  did they trace back your luggage ? 
 i am still waiting for their call  .  
 take it easy   _comma_   all sufferings have their reward  .  
do you have any seat preferences   _comma_   sir ? 
 yes   _comma_   could you put me in the no smoking section ? 
 yes  .  would you like a window seat ? 
 if one s available   _comma_   please  .  but not over the wing  .  
morning  .  rent a car agency  .  may i help you ? 
 good morning  .  this is paul alexander calling from the isis advertising firm  .  we need a car to the airport for mr  .  phillips  .  
 certainly   _comma_   mr  .  alexander  .  when would mr  .  phillips like to leave ? 
 let me check  .  his flight ’ s at  :   p  .  m  .    _comma_   so he should leave no later than    noon  .  
i m calling today about a bill that i never received  .  
 can you tell me which credit card it was for ? 
 it was for my master card  .  
 you should ve gotten that bill two weeks ago  .  
 i haven t got it in the mail yet  .  
 the computer is showing that all bills have been mailed  .  
 what am i supposed to do about my bill then ? 
 maybe you should call your post office  .  
 but if it s their mistake   _comma_   can i get an extension on my bill payment ? 
 yes   _comma_   but you will need to send us proof of their mistake  .  
 okay   _comma_   thank you very much for your help  .  
 not a problem  .  enjoy the rest of your day  .  
jenny   _comma_   don t you think it s really charming ? 
 yes  .  it s a feast of eyes to walking in the museum  .  
 let s take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum  .  
 what a shame that we can t take pictures  .  
ok   _comma_   allen  .  it s your turn  .  are you ready ? 
 i really would rather just listen  .  isn t there anyone else who wants to sing ?

 oh   _comma_   you are so efficient  .  i thought you might give it to me tomorrow  .  thanks  .  
 you ’ re welcome  .  you know    _comma_    these days i have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination  .  the more i think about it    _comma_    the more i hate myself for being so disorganized  .  i decided to change the situation as soon as possible  .  otherwise i will be more regretful later  .  
 this is encouraging news    _comma_    good for you ! what is your solution    _comma_    then ? 
 the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities  .  it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place  .  
 sounds not bad ! better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more  .  it is about focusing on the right things to do  .  
how are you doing   _comma_   jim ? 
 fine   _comma_   just fine . how about you ? 
 not too bad  .  
i think your presentation impressed the client   _comma_   daniel  .  you did a good job  .  
 thank you   _comma_   mr  .  cooper  .  i hope we get the contract  .  
what s for lunch ? 
 pork chops  .  
what happened to you ? 
 i think i caught a cold  .  
 do you have any symptoms ? 
 runny nose and coughing  .  
 do you have a fever ? 
 i have just taken the temperature   _comma_   i don t think so  .  
 it s not serious  .  
 are you sure ? 
 yes  .  
 what should i do ? 
 you should drink more hot water   _comma_   and do some exercise  .  
what kind of place shall we rent ? 
 it should be close to the university  .  neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is   _comma_   the later we can get up  .  
 absolutely  .  that s the most important thing to take into consideration  .  i m not too worried about the size of the flat  .  
 neither am i  .  so a small place is ok   _comma_   but we ll get a bigger one if it s not expensive  .  do you mind if it s in a noisy area  .  
 i don t mind  .  i m not a light sleeper   _comma_   but quieter is better for when we have to study at home  .  
 good point  .  ok   _comma_   let s go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us  .  
 yes   _comma_   if we re lucky we ll find something in the next few days  .  i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early  .  
 how much do you think the rent will be ? 
 i asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month  .  
i don t think we can meet the delivery date you suggest  .  it s too soon  .  
 well   _comma_   is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of june ? 
 the earliest we can do is by the end of june  .  
did you have any working experience during college ? 
 yes     _comma_     i did some part time jobs such as english tutor     _comma_     salesman     _comma_     and model  .  
 what did you learn from your part time jobs ? 
 i learned to be patient   _comma_   professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales  .  
smells good ! what ’ s for breakfast ? 
 well    _comma_    since we are getting up so late    _comma_    i decided to make a big breakfast ! 
 nice ! brunch ! 
 kind of    _comma_    so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs    _comma_    some french toast and buttermilk pancakes ! 
 wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ? 
 yeah   _comma_   just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light  .  
 looks good ! i ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice  .  
 get the jam and butter while you are in there ! oh ! and don ’ t forget the syrup ! 
can you tell me if there is a flight to new york ? 
 yes  .  flight db    departs at  :   pm and arrives in new york at  :   am with a layover in chicago  .  it also makes a refueling stop at colombia  .  
 so many stops ! don t you have any direct flights ?

 i m sorry i was too tired to fall asleep  .  
 when you woke up   _comma_   the water was coming out of the tub  .  
 right . can i compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ? 
would you like some more coffee ? 
 no thanks  .  i m full  .  we need to find our waitress and get our bill  .  
 the waitress is bringing the bill right now  .  
 this waitress has really been on top of things   _comma_   hasn t she ? 
 yes   _comma_   this waitress did a great job  .  
 ok   _comma_   let s see what the damage is  .  the total for our meal is      .     .  
 what do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ? 
 fifteen percent is a normal tip   _comma_   but she really did a great job  .  what do you think about    % this time ? 
 yes   _comma_      % would be perfect  .  
 her tip will end up being     .    plus the bill of      .     .  the total will be      .     .  
 yes   _comma_   that was one fantastic meal ! 
 i agree  .  maybe we can come back again next week  .  
it ’ s time for me to go now  .  
 would you like me to go with you ? 
 i ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things  .

 i am innocent  .  
would you like to come by and play bridge ? 
 well   _comma_   let s see  .  why don t we go dancing for a change ? we haven t done that for a long time  .  
 well    _comma_    to tell the truth    _comma_    i don t really feel like it tonight  .  i had a pretty hard day and i m sort of tired  .  
 hmm  .  well    _comma_    in that case    _comma_    we could go to the movies  .  
 oh   _comma_   we always go to the movies  .  can t we do something different ? 
 well   _comma_   do you have any suggestions ? 
 let s see  .  how do you feel about playing bridge ? 
 it s ok with me   _comma_   but we don t have any beer and things  .  
 well    _comma_    shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over    _comma_    and i ll go to the store and buy some stuff  .

what s our target audience for this campaign ? 
 this go around we re focusing on new moms   _comma_   families with median income and one or more children under the age of two  .  
 do you think that s much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? 
 well        _comma_        there are some similarities that come up  .  because both groups are made up of mothers  .  so as before        _comma_        we can play up on maternal instincts        _comma_        hygiene        _comma_        safety        _comma_        along those lines  .  but that being said        _comma_        there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here  .  
 right   _comma_   that makes sense  .  what s the average age ? 
 demographics say an average age of    .      _comma_    educational background of university or post grad    _comma_    annual household income of       k a year  .

 thanks for your help  .  
i miss grandma  .  i dreamed about her yesterday  .  
 dear   _comma_   let ’ s drop the subject  .  
good morning   _comma_   sir  .  can i help you ? 
 good morning  .  i d like to cash this check  .  
 yes   _comma_   sir  .  can you show you identity ? 
 what about the driving license ? 
 don t you have any other identification ? 
 i am sorry  .  i only have my driving license with me  .  
 ok  .  would you please sign your name on the back of the check ? 
 thank you  .  here you are  .  
 how do you want your money ? 
 would you give me some in twenties and tens ? 
 all right  .  please wait for a moment  .  
could you fill in this form   _comma_   please ? 
 all right  .  
 have you got any identification ? 
 yes   _comma_   here s my id card  .  
oh   _comma_   my god ! i ve been cheated ! 
 what ? what did you buy ? 
 it s a brick ! i can t believe how stupid i was  .  damn it ! 
 what is it ? why did you buy a brick ? 
 there was a guy on the sidewalk . he had three new boxes   _comma_   panasonic video camera boxes . he said he had to get rid of them quick  .  
 and ? 
 so he said he d sell me one for twenty dollars  .  a four hundred dollar camera for twenty bucks  .  
 and it s a brick ? 
 yes  .  
 i can t believe how stupid you are  .  why didn t you open the box ? 
 i wanted to  .  but he said     _comma_     no     _comma_     the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . if it s opened     _comma_     other people won t believe it s new  .  
 so he had the boxes wrapped in plastic  .  
 yes    _comma_    it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . look    _comma_    it even had a bar code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new  .  
 but why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
 he said he had to get rid of them  .  they were stolen  .  
 aha ! now i understand . you were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . so    _comma_    what i think is    _comma_    you deserve to get cheated ! 
 c mon   _comma_   don t blame me ! i thought it was a new camera  .  we could use it . we were even thinking about buying a camera  .  i don t understand how he could have such a perfect looking box  .  
 that s no problem . he just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap  .  that s easy . and probably it s the same shop he got the boxes from . maybe his friend works in an electronics store  .  they sell video cameras there . probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . so they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . twenty dollars a brick  .  that s a good profit if they can sell enough bricks  .  
 you re right   _comma_   sarah  .  i was a fool  .  i can t believe it  .  how could i fall for such a trick ? 
hello   _comma_   arthur  .  what seems to be the problem ? 
 hey doc  .  well    _comma_    i think i might need glasses  .  i ’ m getting headaches    _comma_    and i really struggle to see things that are far away  .  but i have always had       vision  .  
 sounds like you may be far sighted  .  ok    _comma_    then    _comma_    cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you  .  
 mmm  .   .  x       _comma_       e       _comma_       r       _comma_               _comma_       a question mark       _comma_       and i can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but i think it ’ s the peace sign  .  
 wow   _comma_   arthur ! you ’ re as blind as a bat ! 
 yeah    _comma_    i know    _comma_    my vision is really blurry at times  .  
 ok then   _comma_   head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while i fill out your prescription  .  
 thanks doc ! 
 arthur   _comma_   that ’ s the bathroom  .  
would you like some more coffee ? 
 no thanks  .  i m full  .  we need to find our waitress and get our bill  .  
 good luck finding the waitress ! 
 the service this evening has kind of sucked  .  is that our server over there ? 
 i ll go get the check   _comma_   since our server doesn t seem to be headed this way  .  
 good  .  i ll just stay here until you get back  .  
 so the total is      .    for our dinner  .  
 how much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ? 
 i wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service  .  
 i kind of feel the same way   _comma_   but they may have just been really short staffed tonight  .  
 i think that we should leave    %  .  
     .    will be the right amount for the tip  .  
i want to fly to congo on monday   _comma_   the   th  .  
 let me see what s available  .

how much was your watch ? 
 take a guess  .  
a guy in my office got the flu the other day  .  today i seem to have come down with it   _comma_   too  .  
 very likely  .  you have a slight fever  .  do you have a headache   _comma_   too ? 
 yes  .  i wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon   _comma_   because i ll be on a business trip in two days  .  
 well   _comma_   you have to let your flu run its course  .  you must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest  .  usually it will take   to   days to make a full recovery  .  
 but i m going on a business trip in two days ! 
 maybe you ll have to cancel it or postpone it  .  if you go out while you are sick   _comma_   it won t help you recover  .  you may even pass your disease on to others  .  
would you care for a drink ? 
 no   _comma_   thanks  .  i m fine  .

i d like to extend my visa for another two years  .

 student visa  .  
 what is the reason for extension ? 
 i ll go into a practical training as soon as i receive my master ’ s degree from the university of pennsylvania early next month  .

 i absolutely love the apartment  .  
 everything is okay ? 
 i do have one problem with the apartment  .  
 what ’ s the problem ?

 we will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment  .  
 i did not know that  .  
 i assure you that we will    _comma_    and if there are any more problems    _comma_    feel free to tell me  .

come in   _comma_   arnold  .  have a seat  .  
 good morning  .  
 would you like something to drink ? 
 no   _comma_   thank you  .  i just had two cups of coffee at my desk  .  
 so   _comma_   you re a serious coffee drinker  .  
 yes   _comma_   it keeps me going  .  sometimes i think i m addicted  .  
 well    _comma_    coffee isn t such a bad thing . everyone has to have something . for me    _comma_    it s cigars  .  are you a cigar smoker ? 
 no   _comma_   i ve tried them  .  but i m not really a smoker  .  
 well   _comma_   what would you like to talk to me about ? 
 i wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal  .  
 i m glad when people have new ideas around here  .  tell me about it  .  
 it is about the staff meetings . you know how we have a staff meeting every tuesday  .  
 yes  .  
 well   _comma_   i have been thinking about it . and i believe we could do things more efficiently here  .  
 what do you suggest ? 
 the way it is now   _comma_   the staff from all four branches get together once a week . we meet for one hour  .  but i think a lot of time is wasted in transportation  .  
 you mean because people have to go across town to get here  .  
 yes  .  some people spend half of the morning on the road  .  
 that s true  .  but our staff meetings are very important   _comma_   arnold  .  i don t know how we can function without them  .  
 i think they are important too . that   s why i want people to have a better attitude about them  .  
 i know a lot of people think the meetings aren t too useful  .  i m aware of that  .  
 here s what i propose  .  i think we should meet once every two weeks   _comma_   but meet for ninety minutes or more  .  
 well  .  
 i also think the meetings should be more focused . and i would be willing to take responsibility for that  .  
 you mean you want to run the meetings ? 
 no     _comma_     not really run them  .  but i could help organize them  .  i could discuss meeting topics with you     _comma_     and then prepare a schedule for each meeting  .  i could then send an e mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting . this way the meetings would become more focused     _comma_     and people would prepare better  .  
 hmm  .  but we would meet every two weeks  .  
 i really think it would work . the meetings could be longer   _comma_   and better organized  .  
 i am not against the idea     _comma_     arnold . it may really be more efficient     _comma_     as you say  .  i ll tell you what we can do . why don t we try your proposal for a month     _comma_     and see how it works  .  
 excellent  .  i would be happy to get started on it  .  
 i will call the managers . then tomorrow i ll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this   new style  .

 you ve been gone for two hours  .  how could you get lost for so long ?

 you americans usually have nutritious food  .  
 oh   _comma_   but chinese food is so delicious  .  i wish i knew how to cook chinese food  .  do you follow recipes ? 
 we use different spices but few people use recipes  .  they learn to cook by experience  .  
 i always use a recipe but my grandmother never did  .  she was a great cook  .  she would make clam chowder and cornbread every sunday night  .

good afternoon miss    _comma_    would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? you know    _comma_    you can never get enough  .  
 i think my husband has some  .  
 are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? if something terrible happened with your husband    _comma_    and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance    _comma_    my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you  .  
 that ’ s true  .  if something happened to my husband     _comma_     i might lose everything  .  both of us have to work to keep our home     _comma_     car     _comma_     and our children ’ s education  .  i can ’ t afford that by myself  .  
 could we sit and look at the policy i mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ? 
 certainly  .

you look depressed  .  what s on your mind ? 
 well   _comma_   i had a blood test last week  .  the doctor said that i have high blood pressure and my blood is thick and sticky  .  i m very worried  .  
 take it easy  .  when we last talked   _comma_   you promised there would be more exercises in your life  .  but now you are putting on some weight  .  
 i have to admit it s easier said than done  .  
 well   _comma_   i think it s time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle  .  regular exercise will improve your health  .  
 but you know i m just not into exercises  .  and i wouldn t have time for exercises   _comma_   either  .  
 you can do some jogging  .  it s easy and it doesn t take much time  .  
 actually   _comma_   my doctor said the same thing  .  
excuse me    _comma_    sir    _comma_    but you have to put your bags here before entering the market  .

 i m not sure where they sell bus passes at  .  
 why didn t you just ask me ? 
 where should i go ? 
 you can get one from student services  .  
 i had no clue that i could get it there  .  
 i already knew that  .  
 thanks for letting me know  .  
 you re welcome  .  
 i m going to go and get it right now  .  
tomorrow is my first day at work   _comma_   what do you think i should be wearing ? 
 well       _comma_       if you want to look professional       _comma_       serious and more conservative       _comma_       a blue dress       _comma_       white shirt and not too high shoes would be the best choice  .  but sometimes       _comma_       very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues  .  it depends on the company ’ s dress code  .  
 indeed    _comma_    i found most of the employees dress casually when i went to the interview  .  only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony  .  it seems that their dress code is not that formal  .  probably    _comma_    i should put on car key and simple shirt  .  
 whatever you choose   _comma_   make sure they are neat and clean  .  
excuse me  .  will you please keep an eye on my suitcase ? i just want to make a phone call  .  
 certainly   _comma_   but will it take long ?

 i think that will over process your hair   _comma_   you should wait at least two weeks  .  
 all right  .  i ll just have the cut and perm today  .  
 great  .  my assistant will wash your hair   _comma_   and then i ll be back to help you  .  
 ok  .  
oh   _comma_   damn  .  there ’ s another traffic jam on the highway  .  
 how can there be a traffic jam on a      lane highway every day ?

 oh   _comma_   no problem  .  
 great  .  i forgot to ask you   _comma_   though  .  how long did you want the place ? 
 six months  .  
 oh    _comma_    well    _comma_    that might be a problem  .  i usually only sign one year leases  .  
 well    _comma_    one year would be fine    _comma_    too  .  i ’ m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon  .  
 well   _comma_   if it ’ s not a problem  .  then here you go  .  
 just let me look at it quickly  .

 no   _comma_   you know i can t bear eating less  .  
 then do the slim pills take effect on you ? 
 i ve quit it already  .  i go to aerobics class everyday instead  .  
 how s it going on ? 
 you see  .  i ve lost my weight in spite of my good appetite  .  
 i d better exercise my body too  .  my limbs are rusty now  .  
 i don t think so  .  you look full of energy every day  .  time has stood still with you  .  
 thank you  .  
ahhs ! i m beat ! 
 what happened to you ? you look like you got hit by a tornado ! 
 i just got back from fighting the crowds  .  
 you mean at the mall ? was there a sale ? 
 yeah  .  for five minutes   _comma_   everything was half off  .  it was total chaos  .  
 cool ! 
 grabbing   _comma_   pushing and shoving  .  
thank god you are open ! i have an emergency ! 
 hello   _comma_   mr  .  henderson what can i do for you ? 
 i need this dress and this suit dry cleaned asap ! 
 ok   _comma_   i can have it ready by the end of the week  .  
 no    _comma_    you don ’ t understand    _comma_    i need this tomorrow morning ! i accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ’ s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! she ’ s gonna kill me ! 
 ok    _comma_    i can have it ready tomorrow afternoon    _comma_    but this suit is also very stained  .  i can ’ t guarantee we can remove it completely  .  
 fine ! can you also iron and starch this shirt ? 
 certainly  .  
 great ! this is our secret ! if you see my wife   _comma_   say nothing to her about this ! 
how often does the bus run ? 
 every five minutes  .  
 oh   _comma_   here comes a bus ! 
 it comes on the dot  .  
my warmest congratulations on your promotion ! 
 thanks  .  it ’ s nothing special actually  .  
 don ’ t say that  .  it owes to your efforts and team spirit  .  
 oh   _comma_   it was nothing  .  anyone could have done it  .  i still have a lot to learn yet  .  
 you are very modest  .  best luck in your new position  .  
 thank you  .  i won ’ t let this promotion change me  .  
yes   _comma_   emergency  .  there is a huge fire here  .  
 calm down   _comma_   sir  .  what s your name and where are you now ? 
 my name is jerry and we are on the intersection of west road and east road  .  
 sir   _comma_   leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house  .  our men will be over in   minutes  .  
do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? 
 of course ! it is the no  .    stressor in my life  .  you know job stress has become a very common problem these days  .  so we must learn to cope with it  .  
 totally agree  .  what is your solution ? 
 well      _comma_      there are two causes of job stress  .  one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition  .  so if we want to manage job stress      _comma_      both we and the companies should do something  .  for me      _comma_      i am trying to balance work and leisure time  .  you know      _comma_      all work and no play make jack a dull boy  .  
 you seem to have a very relaxed outlook  .  
 it is necessary  .  positive attitude helps to prevent stress  .  
 but i don ’ t think we can change our working condition  .  anyway   _comma_   we are not the bosses  .  
 i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them   _comma_   like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities  .  our boss is a smart person  .  he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team  .  
excuse me   _comma_   is this the parcel counter ?

 he has had a fever for one day  .  just now at home   _comma_   he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up  .  we were at a loss what to do  .  we called an ambulance and brought the baby here  .  
 how long did the convulsion last ? 
 about   minutes  .  
 does he have any other complaints ? 
 three days ago     _comma_     he began to cough     _comma_     sneeze and have a running nose  .  yesterday     _comma_     he began to have a fever  .  
 have you taken his temperature ? 
 it was    ° c this morning and it was    ° c just now  .  
 let me examine him to see if there is any rash  .  no rash  .  
 is it serious ? is it meningitis ? 
 no    _comma_    it is not meningitis  .  just a high fever and convulsions    _comma_    which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection  .  
 does he have to be admitted to hospital ? 
 no  .  no need for admission  .  i ll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first  .  then i will give you a prescription  .  the pink tablets are used for his fever  .  when his temperature is over    ° c   _comma_   give him one tablet  .  the other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions  .  the white liquid is for the cold  .  give the baby plenty of water to drink  .  
 thank you very much   _comma_   doctor  .

 hey   _comma_   look over there  .  it seems that there is something interesting going on  .  let s go and have a look  .  
 sure  .  it s probably the skiing show  .  adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors  .

 hey   _comma_   don t be so pathetic  .  it s a maximal sports show  .  what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show  .  
 you are right  .  but what if the avalanche happened ? 
 they are all very experienced and great skiers  .  so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim  .  
 anyway    _comma_    the show is breathtaking  .  by the way    _comma_    where did they get so much snow in here ? 
 don t you know that ? are you kidding me ? 
 hey   _comma_   not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist  .

 it s possible  .  but the boss here said they were doing whatever they can  .  
 it s a good thing  .  ok   _comma_   let s go skiing  .  
 here we go  .

now people are talking about world recession which started more than a year ago  .  can you give us your personal assessment of the situation of the global economy ? 
 as you know    _comma_    we are in a very special time  .  this is a very hard time for many countries   economics    _comma_    both developed and developing  .  i think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies  .  
 what is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country s economy ? 
 once the us economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack   _comma_   the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world  .  
 what challenges is your country s economy facing at the moment ?

 outside or inside ? 
 outside   _comma_   on the sidewalk  .  
 hmm  .  it s very cold today . but i brought my jacket  .  maybe it will be alright to wait  .  
 the myoma is very popular  .  there will be a lot of people  .  
 myoma ? what s that ? 
 oh   _comma_   sorry . it stands for the museum of modern art  .  it s an acronym  .  m o m a myoma  .  
 i see  .  do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ? 
 i suggest you go to the jewish museum . it   s not far from the guggenheim    _comma_    near central park  .  it is really very interesting . also    _comma_    there is a great museum of medieval european art further up north . it   s called the cloisters  .  
 how can we get up there ? 
 you can take a bus  .  
 but larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous  .  
finally we have a long holiday  .

 we have nothing on sale today  .  but we re having a big sale next weekend  .  
 is the sale going to include dresses ? 
 everything you can see will be on sale  .  
 i like the sound of that  .  i ll just come back next weekend  .

 is that all i can do for you today ? 
 i won ’ t be needing anything else  .  
do you like the room ? 
 yes  .  what is the rent ? 
       per month  .  
 then what s the rent due date ? 
 at the beginning of the month  .  besides   _comma_   you should pay me        as deposit  .  
i d like to talk to mr  .  white please ? 
 he stepped out of the office for a little while  .  
 when is a good time to catch him ? 
 in about twenty minutes  .  
give me a book please   _comma_   jane  .

i can ’ t make out anything   _comma_   the words are too light  .  i thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month  .

 check with somebody from the it department  .  they are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment  .  
what should i do to prepare for a job interview ? 
 an understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential  .  do you have that ? 
 sort of    _comma_    but i could know more    _comma_    i guess  .  
 with that understanding   _comma_   you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude  .  right ? 
 i think that they are a very formal company  .  
 what you wear is important  .  so keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing  .  need help ? 
 i need a lot of help in this area  .  
 in addition to clothes we need to think about other basics   _comma_   ok ? 
 yes   _comma_   what else should we think of ?

i am sorry to trouble you   _comma_   but there s a lot of noise in the next room  .

 please fill out the form first  .  
 ok   _comma_   can you bring me a new one ? 
 of course  .  
excuse me  .  i need to refill this prescription  .  
 it says on the bottle here that you can have two refills  .  
 yes   _comma_   i need to refill it today  .  
 alright  .  i m sorry    _comma_    miss  .  according to our file    _comma_    this prescription has already been refilled twice  .  
 i was worried about that  .  i couldn t remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not  .  
 well   _comma_   it looks like you have . you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription  .  
 listen  .  this is an emergency  .  i tried to call my doctor   _comma_   but he is out of town  .  so i can t see him in time  .  i need this medicine  .  it is for skin condition  .  i ve run out . can you just refill it once more ? 
 i m sorry   _comma_   miss  .  we can t do it  .  we must follow the prescription . and this prescription has run out  .  
 but i need it  .  please  .  refill it for me just this once  .  i can go to the doctor around ten days from now  .  then i ll have another prescription  .  
 miss   _comma_   i understand your problem . but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription . it   s the law  .  i can t do anything about it . we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription  .  never  .  
 but i have a prescription  .  i just need more of it  .  
 a prescription must be valid  .  it cannot be an expired prescription  .  i m sorry   _comma_   miss  .  it s the law . you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you  .  
 oh    _comma_    it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan    _comma_    and i can only see one doctor . it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor  .  
 miss    _comma_    i just can t help you on this  .  i m a pharmacist    _comma_    not a doctor  .  and there are other customers i need to help now  .  i know it is frustrating when this happens . but there is nothing i can do about it  .  i m sorry  .  
 this is ridiculous ! in taiwan   _comma_   it is much easier to get medicine when i need it  .  
 maybe that s true  .  i don t know . but i m sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too  .  
what are you doing ? 
 i ’ m trying to put the vase on the shelf  .  
 let regive you a hand  .  
 no    _comma_    thank you  .  i can manage it    _comma_    i think  .  
there are so many record players here  .  that is hard to choose  .  
 look at this one  .  it has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers  .  
 i d rather get one with separated speakers . they give a clear sound  .  
 yes   _comma_   but we shouldn t get any thing too big  .  remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture  .  
 that s right  .  now this one looks alright ? it s a detached or do you prefer this one ? it s sony  .  
 let s ask the salesmen for a demonstration  .  
ahhchooo ! 
 you ve been sneezing a lot lately  .  are you sick or something ? 
 no  .  every spring time around april   _comma_   i m stricken with allergies  .  
 i never have seasonal allergies  .  
 consider yourself lucky  .  
 what are all the symptoms ? 
 well       _comma_       as you just saw       _comma_       i sneeze a lot  .  also       _comma_       my nose becomes very runny       _comma_       my throat sometimes itches       _comma_       and my eyes start to water  .  
 that doesn t sound good  .  
 no   _comma_   it s not  .  so you don t have any type of allergies ? 
 well   _comma_   i have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol  .  it runs in the family  .  
 everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol  .  
 i get it pretty bad  .  my whole face turns red    _comma_    including my ears  .  my eyes become bloodshot    _comma_    and i start to itch all over my body  .  
 that s pretty bad  .  
 but that doesn t stop me from drinking  .  ahahah  .  
let s have a look at the map first  .  
 all right  .  wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here  .  
 let s buy some tickets  .  
 the train is coming  .  there are a lot of people waiting here  .  let s stand in a better position to get on the train 
 well    _comma_    it s not as crowded as we expected    _comma_    is it ? 
 no    _comma_    but it will be soon  .  look    _comma_    there re two empty seats over there  .  let s get them  .  
what do you do ? 
 i m an apprentice with a local engineering firm  .  my training lasts for two years  .  two days a week i study engineering at a local college  .  if i pass all my exams   _comma_   i hope the company will take me on as an engineer  .  
i want to keep a pet   _comma_   but i don t know which one to buy ? 
 dogs are nice    _comma_    but they are really energetic    _comma_    and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day  .  
 having a dog would probably be too much work for me   _comma_   then  .  
 what about cats ? they are more independent  .  
 actually   _comma_   i was thinking of something a little more exotic  .  i don t want a common pet like a dog or a cat  .  
 how about a lizard ? are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ? 
 yeah   _comma_   are they easy to look after ? 
 yeah   _comma_   they are pretty low maintenance ; they eat almost anything  .  
can i be of any service to you ? 
 i ve been told that chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship  .  we d like to take some home  .  what would you recommend ? 
 there are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop . for example       _comma_       there is tricolored pottery originating in the tang dynasty       _comma_       embroidery       _comma_       batik       _comma_       jade carving       _comma_       just to name a few . do you have anything in mind ? 
 no   _comma_   not really . but i think it should be something distinctively chinese  .  and easy to carry  .  
 i would suggest you buy paper cuts   _comma_   embroidery and batik . they are very easy to carry  .  
 so   _comma_   we d like to see some embroidery  .  
hey   _comma_   mary  .  we re back  .  have you eaten yet ? 
 i had some bread for breakfast  .  
 let s go out for brunch  .  
 brunch ? 
 it is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch  .  on sundays   _comma_   many americans sleep late and go out for brunch  .  those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also  .  
 actually    _comma_    many taiwanese wake up late on sunday mornings    _comma_    too  .  it may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch  .  
hi   _comma_   my name is sovia . what ’ s your name ? 
 my name is jeff  .  
 what do you do ? 
 i ’ m a podiatrist  .  what about you ? 
 i ’ m a nurse . what do you do in your free time ? 
 i like to play piano   _comma_   go bowling and chat with my friends . and you ? 
 i like to hang out with my friends   _comma_   play games and go swimming  .  
 would you like to go out some time ? 
 sure   _comma_   that ’ d be great . where would you like to go ? 
 anywhere with you  .  
 aren ’ t you sweet  .  
oh    _comma_    i m starving  .  i d like to try some real chinese cuisine  .  what would you recommend    _comma_    waiter ? 
 well      _comma_      it depends  .  you see      _comma_      there are eight famous chinese for instance      _comma_      the sichuan cuisine      _comma_      and the hunan cuisine  .  
 they are both spicy hot   _comma_   i ve heard  .  
 that s right  .  if you like hot dishes   _comma_   you could try some  .  
 they might be too hot for me  .  
 then there s the cantonese cuisine and the kiangsu cuisine  .  most southerners like them  .  
 what about any special beijing dishes ? 
 there s the beijing roast duck  .  
 oh   _comma_   yes  .  i ve heard a lot about it  .  i d like very much to try it  .  where can i find it ? 
 you can find it in most restaurants   _comma_   but the best place is certainly quanjude restaurant  .  
 is it near here ? 
 not too near but not too far either  .  a taxi will take you there in    minutes    _comma_    if the traffic is not too bad    _comma_    i mean  .  
 well   _comma_   thank you for your information  .  but what is the name of that restaurant again ? 
 let me write it down on this slip of paper for you  .  you can show it to the taxi driver  .  
 that s very kind of you  .  thanks a lot  .  
hi   _comma_   isaiah  .  how are you ? 
 i ’ m well  .  and you ? 
 fine  .  how ’ s your job going ? 
 i don ’ t know if i told you or not   _comma_   but i decided to start my own business  .  
 really ? that ’ s fantastic  .  what kind of business is it ? 
 i ’ ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from goldman sachs  .  
 how ’ s it going ? 
 it started off a bit slow    _comma_    but now    _comma_    business is really booming ! 
 that ’ s such great news  .  i ’ m really happy for you ! where is your office located ? 
 our headoffice is here in beijing   _comma_   but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon  .  
 where will those be located ? 
 if all goes well   _comma_   we ’ ll open one up in hong kong in april and another one in singapore in october  .  
 when will you find out ? 
 we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow  .  
 well   _comma_   good luck  .  i hope it all goes well for you tomorrow ! 
 thanks ! 
ant shirley   _comma_   it s being years since we last met  .  how were you doing in the passing years ? 
 pretty well  .  what about you ? 
 fine  .  where are the other guys ? 
 it s a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie  .  
 bad timing  .  i want to see them so much  .  how are they ? 
 not bad  .  i heard you are going to graduate this coming summer   _comma_   right ? 
 yes   _comma_   that s why i m here  .  i m thinking about buying a second hand apartment  .  
 did you go to a real estate agent ? 
 no   _comma_   that will be too expensive  .  
 that s true  .  by the way   _comma_   what kind of apartment are you looking for ? 
 my first job s salary will be a bit low  .  so the cheaper the better  .  just one i can afford  .  
 sure  .  i ll try my best to find a satisfying one for you  .  
 i ll appreciate it so much  .  
good afternoon  .  
 my goodness ! it ’ s the afternoon ? doesn ’ t the time fly ! do come in and sit down  .  
 thank you  .  
 what ’ s the time ? my watch has stopped  .  
 it ’ s half past twelve  .  
 when do you have lunch ? 
 from one to two  .  
 what do you normally eat ? 
 we usually go to the cafeteria  .  
 oh   _comma_   it ’ s time to have lunch now  .  
 let ’ s go together  .

 that s pretty interesting  .  did you get one from haven ? the reason i ask is that i am looking for her number  .  
 sorry   _comma_   i don t have it  .  but i do have her email  .  you want me to sent it to you ? 
 yeah   _comma_   that would be great  .  thanks  .  
 no worries  .  i just for her card  .  and you can get her from email  .  i would really like to talk to her again  .  i kind of miss her a little this days  .  
 thanks million  .  
 my pleasure  .  
there are so many eating utensils on the table  .  which ones do i use first ? 
 use them from the outside in  .  
 i see  .  a set for appetizers and another for the main course  .

 oh yeah  .  the big napkin goes on my lap  .  
 let s look at our menus  .  
 cindy   _comma_   help me order because i m still not very familiar with american cooking  .

 i really have to go  .  
 why ? i still wanted to talk to you  .  
 i have things to do  .  
 like what ? 
 don t be nosey  .  
 i m not  .  i just want to know  .  
 well   _comma_   it s really none of your business  .  
 that s harsh  .  
 i m sorry   _comma_   but i have to go  .  
 fine  .  
mom   _comma_   will you have time to help me with my homework today ? 
 sorry   _comma_   i won t  .  i ll be working against the clock to finish my presentation  .  
well     _comma_     peter     _comma_     you have to do better than that next time     _comma_     won ’ t you ? 
 have i really got to do those exams again   _comma_   dad ? 
 of course   _comma_   you have  .  you must try harder this time  .  
 and must i go back to school ? 
 no   _comma_   you needn ’ t do that  .  you ’ d better get a part time job somewhere and go to evening classes  .  
 but dad   _comma_   i should be working full time at my age  .  i ’ m nearly     .  
 you ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams  .  you have to take a job and study  .  
 what else i ’ ve got to do ? join the army ? 
 who knows ! that might come to later  .  
how do you do ?

 yes   _comma_   i wanted to look for some information on the company page just now  .  it took me almost one minute to open it  .  then there is no response for any click  .  
 i have the same question  .  i can ’ t send out mails  .  we ’ d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately  .  
 ok  .  
i need help  .  i think my arm is broken  .  
 alright  .  have you been to this hospital before ? 
 no   _comma_   i haven t  .  i need help quick  .  it hurts really badly  .

 i m sorry   _comma_   sir  .  you will need to wait at least a short time . we are very busy tonight  .  there was a big car accident on highway      .  
 i thought this was the emergency room  .  
 it is  .  but unless you are critically injured    _comma_    you still need to wait . you aren t bleeding    _comma_    are you ? 
 no  .  only a little  .  i fell off my porch  .

 that s very inconvenient for you then . you   ll probably have a cast on your left arm  .  
 yes  .  but why do i have to fill out a form anyway ? this is the emergency room  .  
 yes   _comma_   it is  .  but even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done . have you ever been in an emergency room before ? 
 no  .  just let me see a doctor  .  i m worried about my arm  .  
 be brave   _comma_   sir  .  it won t be long  .  i will fill out the form for you  .  what is your name ?

 yes   _comma_   it is  .  thanks  .  i ’ m just surfing on the internet  .  
 here ? in this cafe ? how can you do that ? 
 this cafe offers a wireless internet connection  .  that means i can get on the net for free while i ’ m here  .  of course   _comma_   i have to buy a cup of coffee ! 
 that ’ s great  .  can you do it anywhere ? 
 no  .  you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection  .  there are only about    or    places that offer it in this city  .  
 so   _comma_   what programs do you have on your laptop ? 
 i ’ ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs  .  
 i know you are keen on photography  .  it ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera  .  then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone    _comma_    anywhere    _comma_    at a 
 it ’ s wonderful   _comma_   isn ’ t it ? would you like to see some photos that i took recently ?

 i hope i could get promoted some day  .  tell me about your experience   _comma_   ok ? 
 well     _comma_     just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough     _comma_     you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective  .  don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging  .  they might be opportunities and failing is not fatal  .  you learn more from that actually  .  sometimes     _comma_     you need to fail to be successful  .  
 how do you think if i volunteer for some work ? 
 i think it is a smart idea  .  our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives  .

 i couldn t find the files you request   _comma_   even though i checked all the cross references  .  i don t think it s there  .  
 i am sure that document was filed  .  
 well   _comma_   let me check again under a different heading  .  
 good idea ! it seems that i asked you to put it in nova s files  .

 you need to go to sleep now   _comma_   so go to sleep  .  
 good night  .  
i want to go try on these clothes  .  
 what did you find ? 
 i found some jeans   _comma_   and a new blouse  .  
 go and try it on  .  
 what do you think ? 
 i love that shirt on you  .  
 what about the jeans ? 
 they don t really fit you right  .  
 i don t think so either  .  
 that blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though  .  
 well   _comma_   i ll just buy the shirt  .  
 that would be a good idea  .  
now   _comma_   miss childs passed on your resume to me and i ’ ve had the chance to look it over and i must say i ’ m quite impressed  .  
 thank you very much  .  i ’ ve tried to keep it short and clear  .  if there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me  .  
 well yes    _comma_    i do have a number of questions    _comma_    but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview i ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background  .  
 yes      _comma_      of course  .  well as you can see from the resume i ’ m    and grew up in brooklyn      _comma_      new york      _comma_      although our family moved to london when i was quite young      _comma_      at around sixteen  .  
 ah i see   _comma_   so you were actually educated in europe ? 
 yes precisely  .  although i was born in the us   _comma_   i would definitely call london home  .  but as you see i ’ ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country  .  my father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in saudi arabia too  .  
 very interesting  .  so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood  .  
 absolutely ! we were never still for too long  .  but now i ’ m really looking to settle down  .  
 i see  .  okay   _comma_   well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ? 
can you tell me    _comma_    ms  .  smith    _comma_    about the training programs you initiated this year ? 
 we ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained  .  
 what ’ s the result ? 
 we directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of    % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received  .  
 that seems very impressive  .  good work ! 
 thank you   _comma_   but i cannot take all the credit  .  our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level  .  
well    _comma_    good morning    _comma_    tom  .  i haven t seen you for a long time  .  
 i d been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago  .  
 what seems to be the trouble now ? 
 i feel run down   _comma_   tired  .  i ve been having headaches almost every day  .  and i m not getting as much sleep as usually do  .  
 have you been eating properly ? eating the right kind of food is important for your health   _comma_   you know  .  
 well    _comma_    i haven t been eating well    _comma_    i guess  .  i usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch  .  
 and what about dinner ? 
 sometimes i m too tired to eat anything at all  .  
 that s not good  .  you don t have a well balanced diet  .  have you been taking vitamin pills ? 
 i don t like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first  .  
thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us  .

doctor   _comma_   i have the worst toothache ! 
 how long have you had this pain ? 
 for about a week or so   _comma_   but it ’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days  .  
 did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth ? 
 you know    _comma_    i was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day    _comma_    and i accidentally bit down really hard on one  .  
 what kind of toothbrush do you use ? 
 i just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush  .  
 does it bother you when you eat something really cold ? 
 yes   _comma_   it definitely bothers me more when i do that  .  
good evening  .  
 good evening . my wife and i would like a room   _comma_   please . is there any room available ? we don t have a reservation  .  
 let me see . yes   _comma_   we have one room left . you   re lucky . it   s the last one  .  
 good . we   re tired after driving all day   _comma_   and we re looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room  .  
 this room has two double beds . it   s number    at the rear of the motel . it   s quite a comfortable room  .  
 how much is it for one night ? we only need it for tonight . we   re going to continue our trip in the morning  .  
 it s forty five dollars a night for two . is anyone else traveling with you ? 
 no   _comma_   it s just the two of us  .  
 would you like to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card ?

 please fill out this registration card . here is your key . you can park your car in front of our room . check   out time is noon  .  
 thank you very much  .  
 thank you   _comma_   sir . enjoy your stay with us  .  
let s go to the animal shelter  .  
 what do you want to do ? 
 i want to get a puppy for my son  .  
 that will make him so happy  .  
 i ll get him one of those little dogs  .  
 one that won t grow up too big  .  
 and eat too much  .  
 do you know which one he would like ? 
 oh    _comma_    yes    _comma_    i took him there yesterday  .  he showed me one that he really liked  .  
 i bet you had to drag him away  .  
 he wanted to take it home yesterday  .  
 i wonder what he ll name it  .  
hello  .  i want to send the computer to my sister in shanghai by logistics transport  .  
 ok  .  is it in the box ? may i see it ? 
 yes  .  this is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor  .  
 is there anything else ? 
 there are a mouse and a camera  .  
 is that all ? 
 yes  .  how much is it to send these things to shanghai by regular delivery ? 
 it depends on the weight of these things  .  generally speaking   _comma_   we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram  .  
 i see  .  can you weigh them for me   _comma_   please ? 
 please go over there to weigh them  .  
 ok  .  see you later  .  
what happened ? why didn t he win ? 
 didn t you hear ? he was disqualified  .  
 how did that happen ? he s so talented ! i thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! 
 if he didn t have any drug problems   _comma_   he would have won  .  
 what ? what kind of drugs was he using ? 
 he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster  .  
 i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs  .  
 they are  .  the reason why they didn t disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards  .  
 that s so disappointing  .  i don t know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs  .  
 i don t think it s right   _comma_   but i can understand why they might  .  imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! 
 regardless of how much pressure you re under   _comma_   there s never a good reason to take drugs  .  
 i agree  .  hopefully with the new regulations   _comma_   fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs  .  
 let s hope so  .  
i need to use the atm  .  
 what ’ s stopping you ? 
 i ’ m not sure how  .  
 i don ’ t understand  .  
 i ’ ve never used one before  .  
 i can help you figure it out  .  
 what do i have to do ? 
 slide your card into the machine  .  
 then what ? 
 you need to type your pin in  .  
 what do i have to do next ? 
 click on whichever option you want   _comma_   and you ’ re done  .  
what are you doing ? checking the   to do   list for the wedding ? 
 yep  .  there s still so much to do ! 
 so let s start by checking off what we ve already done  .  
 did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the taiwanese guests ? 
 not yet   _comma_   i was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the net  .  
 cool ! i can t believe he agreed to go all the way to dallas with us ! 
 hey ! we re paying for his ticket ! 
it is my first time coming to china  .  i want to buy something unique of china to my friends as gifts  .  
 we have a great variety of chinese antiques and porcelain  .  do you like them ? 
 yes    _comma_    i love them    _comma_    but they are fragile  .  it is not convenient to take them  .  
 you are right  .  how about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ? 
 sounds good  .  may i have a look ? 
 of course  .  these paintings have many designs      _comma_      such as animals      _comma_      flowers      _comma_      landscape      _comma_      aquatics and so on  .  
 they are beautiful   _comma_   but i can t understand the connotation in them  .  let me see the handkerchiefs  .  
 all right  .  chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality  .  
 oh   _comma_   i like the bamboo design  .  what is this ? 
 this is a series of animals   _comma_   called chinese zodiac  .  
 good  .  so i will take three series and five bamboo ones  .  
 ok   _comma_   i will wrap them for you  .  
can you make out what he s saying ? 
 no   _comma_   it s too loud in here  .  
excuse me  .  
 yes ? 
 can you tell me the way to the peak tram   _comma_   please ? 
 certainly  .  go along queen s road  .  
 along queen s road  .  
 yes   _comma_   and turn right at the hilton hotel  .  
 right at the hilton  .  
 then go up garden road   _comma_   past the cathedral  .  
 the cathedral ? 
 yes  .  then cross the road at the next traffic lights  .  the peak tram is straight ahead  .  you can t miss it  .  
 that s very kind of you  .  thank you  .  er  .  have you got a pencil ? 
 yes  .  why ? 
 can you repeat all that ? i think i d better write it down  .  
hi    _comma_    nally    _comma_    are you hungry ? 
 i m starving  .  let s go grab a bite  .  
 where to ? 
 how about karlis ? 
 are you kidding ? that place is too ritzy for lunch  .  
 true  .  ok let s go to grumose ? 
 same thing   _comma_   meals there all coarsen arm and leg  .  
 i guess it is a little pricy  .  
 let s stop it at multicolor for a quick lunch  .  
 that will be ok  .  come on   _comma_   i can t wait to chow down  .  
 that was a great lunch    _comma_    the food was good    _comma_    but the service was lousy  .  
 is that why you stiffed the waiter ? 
 you got it  .  all right   _comma_   let s go back to school  .  
good morning   _comma_   sir  .  
 good morning  .  i d like a business suit made with this material  .  
 do you have a particular style in mind ? 
 the kind that never goes out of fashion   _comma_   i guess  .  
 i think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes  .  
 i m sure you re right  .  i just dread the idea of making a new suit every year  .  
 the changes are usually not that dramatic  .  we just got some pictures of the latest fashion  .  would you like to take a look ? 
 good  .  i think i ll choose this single breasted one  .  when can i get it ? 
 next friday  .  
 thank you  .  
oh   _comma_   gosh ! i feel everything around me is against me  .  
 don t take it too hard  .  there are some tips you should know in job hunting of       .  
 well   _comma_   i am all ears  .  maybe they are helpful  .  
 firstly      _comma_      you must always show your best to the interviewer  .  and secondly      _comma_      try to avoid spamming through e mails      _comma_      because this will make the reader go crazy  .  the last but not the least      _comma_      there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age  .  
 i understand what you mean   _comma_   and i will not upset myself  .  face it  .  
 good luck to us  .  
look   _comma_   mary ! there are so many people over there ! 
 oh    _comma_    i remember    _comma_    there is a job fair in the personnel market  .  
 i have never been to the personnel market  .  
 really ? i have been there several times  .  
 are there many employers ? 
 yes  .  the personnel market is a place specially for job hunters and employers  .  
 so there will be many large companies in the personnel market   _comma_   right ? 
 yes   _comma_   there are many famous corporations  .  
 when will there be a job fair ? 
 every saturday and sunday 
 do i need to pay to go into the personnel market ? 
 no   _comma_   it s free  .  
 how about going there to have a look now ? 
 ok   _comma_   let s go  .  
could you show me the t shirt on the model ? 
 here you are  .  we have three different colors    _comma_    white    _comma_    blue and pink  .  
 what s the price ? 
       .  
 can you make it any cheaper ? 
 it is cheap  .  
 i ll take it if you give me a discount  .  
       .  that s the best i can do  .  
 ok  .  i ll take the blue one  .  
hello   _comma_   again  .  did you discuss everything with your colleagues ? 
 yes   _comma_   yes  .  it seems that everything is settled  .  
 have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ? 
 we have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees s accounts   _comma_   whether they are currently with this bank or not  .  
 that s not a problem  .  
 of course    _comma_    if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank    _comma_    or open new accounts with you  .  
 thank you very much  .  we always welcome new customers  .  
i think this spring is a good time for us to start looking  .  
 we should plan to move out of here before july  .  i m tired of living in apartments  .  
 i know   _comma_   dear  .  i am too  .  but we ve just been too busy to look for a house  .  
 we need to find a good realtor  .  
 not necessarily  .  if we use a realtor to find a house   _comma_   it will be more expensive  .  
 what do you mean ? 
 realtors always get a commission . if the realtor helps us find something   _comma_   we have to pay him  .  
 but doesn t a realtor help with the contract ? i thought they take care of all the legal troubles  .  
 yes   _comma_   that s often true  .  but you have to pay them  .  
 i still think we should have a realtor . we   re new in this country  .  we don t know all the laws of buying a house . and also   _comma_   the realtor will inspect the house . he can tell us if the house has 
 of course we need a home inspector . but we can hire an inspector on our own . and as for the legal problems   _comma_   i have friends  .  they can help us  .  
 so how can we find a house if we don t have a realtor ? 
 it takes a little more time  .  we have to check the ads in the paper . probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . then we have to drive to the homes and look at them  .  
 and doesn t the person selling the house have a realtor ? 
 sometimes they do   _comma_   sometimes they don t  .  it s best to find someone who is selling by themselves  .  
 why ? 
 because if the seller has a realtor   _comma_   their price will be higher . he will have to pay a commission to the realtor  .  
 hmm  .  it all sounds very complicated  .  
 it is  .  but buying a house is very important  .  so it takes time . that   s why we haven t done it yet  .  it s very troublesome  .  
 i want to look in the papers today  .  maybe we can see something we like  .  
 alright  .  i ll buy a newspaper when i go to the drug store  .  
i m calling about our appointment  .  i can t call on you this evening . my wife is terribly ill  .  
 sorry to hear that  .  
 how about next week ? 
 fine   _comma_   we ll be expecting you then  .  
which restaurant do you prefer ? 
 i d like to taste mexican food  .  
 how about the one on baker street ? 
 oh   _comma_   i ve never seen a better mexican restaurant  .  
the numbers in this table don t seem to be in accord with reality  .  
 i know   _comma_   but these are the figures that we came up with  .  
oh   _comma_   so the zoo is over there  .  thank you so much for your help  .  
 you ’ re welcome  .  can i ask you what brings you to china ? 
 i ’ m actually travelling around asia  .  
 oh   _comma_   very nice  .  how long will you be in beijing ? 
 probably another week  .  
 oh     _comma_     i see  .  well     _comma_     i ’ ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide     _comma_     please call me  .  
 thank you very much  .  that ’ s very kind  .  
could you type up this document for me   _comma_   sandra ? 
 sure   _comma_   but i have to finish this report first  .  
 never mind  .  i ll do it  .  
are you interested in mountaineering ? 
 yes     _comma_     in some sense  .  i should say i like mountain climbing     _comma_     you know     _comma_     because i m not so professional  .  how about you 
 i m the same with you   _comma_   an amateur mountain climber  .  i went climbing in the rocky mountains with my friends last summer vacation  .  we spent two days in the mountains  .  
 how did you spend the night there ? 
 we pitched a tent in the night   _comma_   waiting for the sunrise  .  wow ! it was too beautiful  .  
 i had a similar experience   _comma_   but that was on the top of tasha mountain in my country  .  
 tasha mountain ? it s very famous in china   _comma_   isn t ? 
 yes  .  it is one of the five mountains  .  
 i want to climb tasha mountain this summer vacation  .  would you be my guide ? 
 i d love to  .  
sir   _comma_   what s wrong with you ? 
 i have a spasm of nausea and dizziness  .  
 have you ever suffered from airsickness before ? you re probably airsick  .  
 no   _comma_   this is the first time on a plane  .  maybe you are right  .  please get me some pills  .  
 ok  .  i will get some for you  .  there s an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you . please wait me for a moment  .  ( go away for a few minutes   _comma_   and now she comes back  .  ) here are two pills  .  and the water is in the glass too . please take the pills with water  .

 yes  .  first i ll have tomato juice  .

 i ll have the lamb chops    _comma_    well done    _comma_    please  .

 can you show me some traditional chinese arts and crafts ? 
 maybe sandalwood fan is good  .

 i ll take two small ones and a big one  .  
 what else are you interested in ? 
 i m afraid not  .  
 ok  .  here you are  .  
good morning . mrs . smith  .  
 good morning ! can you help me   _comma_   please ? i m looking for some books for my mother  .  
 well   _comma_   what kind of books does she like ? 
 she s very fond of detective stories ? 
 i see . has she read any detective stories ? 
 oh   _comma_   yes ! 
 do you know if she s read this one ? 
 i m not sure   _comma_   but she probably won t remember if she has ! she s very forgetful ! 
 ah ! she has a bad memory . how old is she ? 
 she s eighty seven  .  
 i suggest you take this book . it   s very exciting  .  
 thank you . that   s a good idea . she likes exciting books . can you suggest another one ? 
hey    _comma_    jimmy    _comma_    you ve been sitting in front of the tv all day  .  anything interesting on tv ? 
 not really  .  quite boring right now   _comma_   actually  .  mostly infomercials and public service announcements  .  
 why don t you turn off the tv and get outside ? you need to get some fresh air  .  
 i know    _comma_    i know . but my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes  .  it s the series finals    _comma_    and i wouldn t miss it for the world ! 
 really ? what s the series about ? 
 well   _comma_   it s about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in america  .  it s a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny  .  i think you d like it  .  
 it sounds interesting   _comma_   but i am not a big fan of tv shows  .  they re time consuming and don t have much depth  .  
 i believe some shows are quite informative and interesting  .  take this show for example    _comma_    it examines american xenophobia and how it might conflict with the american dream    _comma_    with hilarious results  .  
 really ? that s interesting ! 
 yeah . oh   _comma_   here it comes ! why don t we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode  .  it should be good  .  
 ok   _comma_   i ll give it a go  .

so that concludes the introduction  .  now let s move to the first part of my talk      _comma_      which is about      fiscal year marketing plan  .  so first      _comma_      right off the bat      _comma_      when looking at the marketing plan      _comma_      tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with  .  
 we wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also    _comma_    in line with that goal    _comma_    redo our image  .  
 that s correct  .  if you remember               _comma_               we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets  .  now               _comma_               when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals               _comma_               there are three things to consider  .  first               _comma_               the original condition of the market               _comma_               second               _comma_               our marketing numbers from the previous year               _comma_               and third               _comma_               our final sales figures for this year  .  now i want to describe for you the second and third parts  .  if you look at the overhead               _comma_               you ll see a graph  .  the blue line represents our sales from the year                    _comma_               the red line is the sales in       .  as you can see               _comma_               our sales in      were quite slow to start off with               _comma_               but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year  .  on the other hand               _comma_               you can see this year s sales took off like a rocket  .  
excuse me    _comma_    sir    _comma_    may i talk to you ?

 your products may have certain advantages   _comma_   but your prices are too stiff  .

 yes   _comma_   it is a bold design  .  people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card  .  it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations  .  
 i agree  .  business cards are great tools for promoting personal business  .  it won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card    _comma_    but it can make a big difference among the crowd  .  and you ’ ll always notice it from your collection  .  for they have outspoken colors    _comma_    own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card  .  i wish to have one like this  .  but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow  .

 have you ever had a dog ? 
 when i was little   _comma_   we had a few domestic dogs at home  .  
 they always say that dogs are a man s best friends  .  do you think that s true ? 
 definitely  .  rich or poor   _comma_   dogs always love their masters  .

hey there chris   _comma_   what are you up to ? 
 i m just poring over some brochures about various car models  .  
 oh   _comma_   so you re thinking about buying a new car ? 
 yeah     _comma_     it looks that way  .  my wife has been bugging me about it  .  i thought we could probably survive without one     _comma_     but with a baby on the way     _comma_     maybe it is time to get a car  .  
 so this would be your first automobile ? 
 that s right  .  for quite a few years   _comma_   i rode a bicycle to work  .  then i got a motorbike  .  
 yeah   _comma_   i think i can understand your wife s position  .  asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she s pregnant is a tall order  .  
 oh  .  i don t let her ride with me  .  it s just too dangerous  .  she takes the bus to work   _comma_   but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it s crowded and hot  .  
 so it s time to buy your very first car ! wow   _comma_   that s exciting ! 
 yes   _comma_   but it s also a pretty big financial responsibility  .  
 yeah  .  i still remember my first car  .  it was an old clunker that my dad gave me when i turned     .  i drove it around for a couple of years until i scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car  .  
 i m having a hard time deciding which model is best for us  .  
 yeah   _comma_   it is a tough call  .  each one has its pros and cons  .  are you looking for a sedan ? 
 yes    _comma_    i d like a jeep    _comma_    but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives  .  
 i d advise you to listen to your wife  .  she will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice  .  
can i help you ? 
 i d like to send a fax to shenzhen  .  
 is it a photograph or a document ? 
 each of both  .  
 could i see both of them ? 
 here you are  .  
 you can t send this document ; it is not clear enough to send  .  the photograph is all right  .  
 well   _comma_   how long will it take to arrive in shenzhen ? 
 couple of minutes  .  
 great  .  how much ? 
      .  you should change another much clearer photograph for fax  .  
 thank you  .  i will deal with it  .

 yes   _comma_   i can see it  .  but what s on it ? 
 it says   keep off the grass !

 be careful  .  you can t smoke here  .  
 why not ? 
 can t you see the notes there ? it says   no smoking here    .  
i d like a double room  .

 probably two days  .  my wife will join me tomorrow  .  then we will decide when to leave for seattle  .  
 would you sign the register   _comma_   pls ? 
 by the way   _comma_   does my room have a private bath ? 
 certainly   _comma_   every room in this hotel has a private bath  .  
 does my room have twin beds or a double ? i prefer a room with twin beds  .  
 your room has twin beds   _comma_   mr . lee  .  it also has a view  .  i am sure you will like it  .  this is your key  .  it s on the eighth floor room      .  the elevator s over there  .

good morning    _comma_    may  .  good girl    _comma_    you are reading english books again  .  
 good morning  .  there is no reason to miss so beautiful a morning  .  is that a new bird ? 
 oh    _comma_    yes    _comma_    my daughter bought it yesterday  .  we call her lulu  .  
 it looks so cute  .  is it a parrot ? 
 yes  .  just look at her colorful feathers  .  what else can it be ? 
 i see  .  it s interesting that there is also a parrot in my english book  .  his mane is polly  .  
 really ? a foreign parrot ! 
 he can speak english   _comma_   too  .  
 maybe you can teach lulu some english words  .

my mp  player is broken   _comma_   so i want to change it for an mp  player  .  can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? 
 an mp  player ? why don t you buy a new cell phone ? you can find an mp  player inside any of the latest cell phones  .  
 oh   _comma_   that s a good idea  .  perhaps i should have a try  .  
 look at my cell phone  .  i can listen to music      _comma_      watch movies      _comma_      take pictures      _comma_      play games      _comma_      surf the web and download documents  .  it s just like a pad  .  
 that s cool  .  i can use the computer and the internet pretty well   _comma_   but i m a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products  .  
 that s ok  .  you know    _comma_    digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry    _comma_    and they won t cost you too much  .  
 yeah     _comma_     if i buy a cell phone like this     _comma_     i don t have to take a music player everywhere i go     _comma_     and i can save the cost of buying an extra mp   .  
 that s right  .  what s the flash memory of your old mp  ? 
    mb  .  
 then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over    mb  .  
what can i get you ? 
 a cheeseburger and an order of french fries would be great  .  
 would you like anything to drink ? 
 i feel like having a coke  .  
 that s a good idea  .  i think i ll join you  .  
mr  .  bryant ? hi   _comma_   i m mike from florence incorporated  .  i ll glad you made it okay  .  how was your flight ? 
 it was pretty bumpy    _comma_    also a bit long    _comma_    all together about   hours  .  
 that is a long flight  .  you had a layover too   _comma_   is that right ? you must be tired  .  
 actually i feel quite rested  .  i was able to sleep on the plane  .  
 good ! here   _comma_   let me help you with your bag  .  is it your first time to seattle ? i d be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you re up to it  .  
 that will be very nice  .  you re too kind  .  
 i ve already made a hotel reservation for you     _comma_     let s go to the hotel first and drop off your things  .  then     _comma_     i d like to have a drink so that we can get better acquainted  .  i ve booked a table at an exclusive restaurant downtown  .  afterwards     _comma_     i ve made arrangements to take you to see the city lights  .  seattle ’ s nightlife can be really quite exciting  .  how does that schedule sound to you ?
