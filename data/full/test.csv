yeah about    years ago i had a horrifying experience .  it was    % their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived .  they had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road . 
did you suffer any injuries?
no i wasn t hit .  it turned out they were drunk .  i felt guilty but realized it was his fault . 
why did you feel guilty? people really shouldn t drive drunk . 
i don t know i was new to driving and hadn t experienced anything like that .  i felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels . 
well _comma_  can you tell me about your experience? i think we swapped places
yeah i wanted to tell you about the time i was hit by a drunk driver im so happy to still be alive after that experience
oh my goodness _comma_  that s very scary! i hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?
yeah he was punished hes in jail still
i there   _comma_    dont know what to do   _comma_    jst broke up with my girlfirned   _comma_    we were   years together
sorry to hear! do you have any idea about the break up? did you think about it ?
yes we decided together with our minds _comma_  and know i come home and feel so distant from the world
sorry again! hope you ll get relief from this sadness .  please concentrate on your interests to divert your mind from this . 
i couldn t wait to go to the concert . 
which concert?
the u  concert .  tickets were really expensive and i never thought we would be able to go _comma_  but somehow we did!!!
wow _comma_  that s awesome! i have never been to an actual concert . 
i m so sad because i ve read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn t believe in medication and doctors
ugh _comma_  those articles always get me too .  :( what was wrong with her? 
she was born premature at home _comma_  she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying
jeez! its so unfortunate .  very sad really .  
yes! and i do believe in god and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let god heal them through doctors
so my friend s baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up
that is nice of you .  what did you do?
i was singing nursery songs :)
which one?
 if you happy and you know it  :)
my husband lost a job but i m hoping he can find a full time job soon
he will _comma_  i have faith . 
thank you so much!
no problem .  what kind of work does he do?
he is an armed guard
i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods! 
thats not good .  do you own a gun?
i do! i want to be able to protect my son
that is always number one goal . 
i m so excited because i m finally going to visit my parents next month! i didn t see them for   years
  years is a long time .  how come?
i moved to the us and they stayed in my homecountry
oh i see .  they must miss you _comma_  too . 
i was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working july  th .  i covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident
that isn t very nice . 
yeah he got caught in someones pics on facebook .  never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures . 
yes .  i do not have a facebook . 
good idea .  i don t like social media that much .  it can get you in to trouble fast _comma_  even when expressing your opinions . 
so yeah i drove   hours to get to wallmart .  with     in my wallet as advertised _comma_  and the real price of the tv was     usd .  what a bummer
thats horrible . 
yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed _comma_  such a terrible feeling!
yes i do not like walmart . 
yes  _comma_   i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the us  _comma_   the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed
my friend s boyfriend recently made a pass at me .  i m married _comma_  and i also am really good friend s with his girlfriend so i felt really bad .  i made sure he knew i was loyal and honest to both!
thats horrible .  did you tell on him?
i struggled with it      _comma_       but my friend was in a really bad spot      _comma_       with no income and raising her grandchild      _comma_       he was the financial supporter .  so      _comma_       i didn t tell her      _comma_       as i knew it would really hurt her in several ways      _comma_       plus she really loves him!
thats a tough situation . 
my baby is sleeping .  it s so peaceful and quiet in this house
i guess it makes you appreciate things you used to take for granted _comma_  lol .  but it doesn t last forever and is worth it .  
i totally agree with you!
that s a full time job raising a human
hi _comma_  i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country
oh _comma_  i m sure you are lonely .  maybe you can join some kind of club that lets you meet new friends?
i was thinking about it! i wanted to join a group for local moms
that s a good idea! this way you can also meet friends for yourself _comma_  but also maybe meet new friend s for your children to hang out with while you do with their moms!
i have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things .  one day at our home   _comma_    he grabbed a game and sat on it   _comma_    instantly breaking it! it was expensive and this really irked me   _comma_    especially because she doesn t discipline him when he does bad things . 
oh man .  i m all about discipline! i don t like spoiled bratty kids
me either! i have two of my own children _comma_  and i would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age .  i just don t understand those kind of  
yes _comma_  i ve heard some parents don t ever say no to their kids .  makes no sense
i m so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died
ok
ugh i hate bugs with a passion _comma_  they are so creepy
i recently spoke with my ex girlfriend on the phone .  the conversation went pretty well _comma_  and it reminded me of my past experiences with her . 
did things end amicably? i hope everything is good now!
yes   _comma_    they ended somewhat well   _comma_    but there were tense moments .  i am glad she s doing well   _comma_    but i miss her . 
i understand that _comma_  i hope things work out well for you both in the end!
thank you! that means a lot . 
one of the times i remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child . 
that is a very blessed day .  it is something you will never forget . 
obviously there are the demands of a new child    but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for _comma_  and the love surrounding the whole situation .  truly something to remember . 
yes _comma_  i couldn t agree more .  it is remarkable how your feeling suddenly change . 
have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through  just  in the nick of time?! talk about gratitude!
i bet that must have been nerve wracking until it happened . 
absolutely .  you go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! it s not a situation i wish to be in again . 
oh i m sure .  i would not like to be in a situation like that .  good thing everything worked out for you . 
im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend
oh really? what happened with your family and friend then?
my friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine .  so seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful i should be 
oh wow _comma_  that s awful .  stuff like that really teaches you to appreciate what you ve got and to not take it for granted . 
yes definitely .  never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you
i m a big believer in listening to your gut .  sometimes i might wonder where my intuition is leading me _comma_  but it always seems to be spot on . 
i agree _comma_  someimes we just know
it is a  knowing     and a flowing! when something is right  _comma_   it just feels easier to go with it    like you re being led  _comma_   even if you might not fully know to where . 
exactly _comma_  i get that entirely!
i couldnt celebrate my   th birthday as i had exams during the time and i felt terrible for it .  but my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best! 
that s great! how did they surprise you?
i was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when i went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there
that is so sweet of them _comma_  i hope you enjoyed it!
i feel lonely sometimes cause i live in a house with   girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and i feel lonely
awww _comma_  that sucks man .  hopefully they don t say mean things to you about being lonely . 
sometimes they joke about it and obviously i make it look like its totally fine cause i dont want to give them the impression that i am lonely but it does hurt sometimes
well i used to be lonely a lot but i eventually found someone .  i think you will too . 
as silly as it sounds _comma_  i was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies .  you re reminded that they re wired with their own personalities from the git go . 
yeah that is always odd to me _comma_  before they can talk they are already unique!
one was pacifier   _comma_    one was fingers .  one wanted to co sleep   _comma_    one liked her space .  one liked facing  out  in the baby bjorn carrier   _comma_    one liked cocooning in a sling!
that is how it goes _comma_  sometimes you can just figure them out immediately
the other day i had a deep craving for chik fil a . 
i understand that one _comma_ they are my favorite place to eat
mine too .  so i drive there and pull in the parking lot and it s completely empty .  i then realized it was sunday . 
that has happened to me too many times to count
i visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment .  it made me realise how thankful i should be for a family
that must have been and intense and emotional moment for you . 
yes it definitely was .  i went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but i ended up learning lots more from him 
uau _comma_  what a surreal moment . i always believe kids have a lot to teach us . 
my oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship .  i ve got to believe that as she gets older _comma_  it will get better!
i m sure it will! i didn t get along with my dad until i became an adult . 
that s always good to hear .  but in the moment    argh _comma_  my  heart  .  how did your mom maneuver the differences between y all? did that wear on her?
yes it did .  i believe she just waited it out and tried to neutralize the conversation when we were together .  
but in the meantime    the unspoken strain is not fun .  but i m glad to hear about a happy ending    thank you for that!
i can still look back with shame at the way i treated a girl in sixth grade .  i wasn t as bad as others _comma_  but that doesn t make me feel any better . 
where you not secure in your self?
well   _comma_    like a lot of  th graders i was aware of  not  wanting to be an outcast for any reason .  and unfortunately   _comma_    she was .  as an adult of course   _comma_    my heart squeezes for  all  the kids we were!
you can track her down to say sorry _comma_  or would that be creepy?
unfortunately  _comma_   she died .  i only found out when facebook first came out  _comma_   and her brother and i  friended  one another . 
wow _comma_  so your going to take being a bad person to the grave .  maybe you ll see her in the next life?
i m currently working for someone that is  such  a great example of a leader! it makes going into work inspiring every day   every way . 
lucky you! that is rare .  maybe one day people will think of you like that?
that s a very kind statement  _comma_   and certainly what i would strive for .  and it s the rarity that  inspires  me .  that should be the norm  _comma_   not the exception! that s what i d like to inspire in people .  how about you?
i have something totally different .  my boss is clueless to the world and have no business being a leader .  
that is soul sapping .  what do you do to inspire yourself _comma_  and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?
well i ve been in the business all my life and have worked for some great people .  so i pull from what i learned from them . 
my friend s baby has grown so much since the last time i had seen her!
it s crazy how quickly kiddos grow! even in a few weeks time! do you see your friend and her baby often?
it had been about   weeks   i don t get out her way often _comma_  even though we live    minutes away . 
that is how life goes! different schedules and demands    i m sure she s so thrilled when she  does  get to see you!
yes!  i got to be  auntie  for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash .   it was a good day for everyone!
running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like  such  a huge accomplishment!
wow _comma_  that is an amazing accomplishment!  congratulations!  you gotta be feeling like you re on top of the world after that!
ah _comma_  it was the best! plus it helped that i purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it    it was the venice marathon!
my first thought was  california  but then there s venice [italy] and then either way _comma_  that s an amazing destination!
we were living overseas at the times    the most impressive part was crossing the grand canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ; )
oh _comma_  wow .   not only to be able to do all the running but to view the scenery!
i recently found out that a person i very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me .  i was pretty surprised . 
i m sorry to hear that! how did you find out? 
she just started treating me differently all of a sudden .  and now she is going to be moving away soon . 
that s a real bummer  _comma_   but as they say  _comma_   there are plenty of fish in the sea!
i m always appalled when i see bullying in action    whether it s on a playground or political stage    not much makes me angrier . 
i feel the same way . 
how do you channel the anger? obviously _comma_  it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion i m upset about    so that can feel hypocritical!
i practice boxing .  i love to punch the sandbags . it is very therapeutic . 
are you ever tempted to put anyone s face on the punching bag?! ha! (kidding not kidding!)
one morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter s cat on the road and he had been hit .  i had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet . 
oh no that is terrible!  how did your daughter take it?
she was around     _comma_   so she took it very hard .  i went ahead and let her stay home from school  _comma_   as i knew she wouldn t do well that day . 
oh poor thing .   i hope she is doing better now .   losing a pet is extremely hard!
i was soooo excited to take our kids to disneyland for the first time!
ooo they are gonna love it  _comma_   just its expensive  _comma_   i remember when it was only     to get in . 
same! i was excited because i grew up going there .  my grandparents lived in tucson _comma_  and we would spend the summers with them    the most exciting part being our drive to disneyland each year!
which one are you going to california or florida ?
california! old school ; ) they ve kept so much of the original _comma_  while adding lots of new attractions . 
i recently spoke to my father for the first time in years .  it reminded me of my childhood and the distant past . 
cool .   somethings never change .   what did you reflect upon?
we spoke about our recent lives .  apparently he is in the market for a new car . 
yeah _comma_  i miss my dad .   he died several years ago .   what kind of car is he looking for?
do you like to organize your house .   my mother in law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b c she knows how much i love it!
i m trying to get into it .  we have our first baby on the way and need to reorganize everything .  do you have tips? 
labels and bins can be your best friend!  especially with a new baby .   
my big thing is i m like o  i may need that leave it out of the tote box .  before i know it i have more stuff laying around then when i started . 
i find it odd    and annoying    when people don t respond to or even acknowledge emails . 
well _comma_  sometimes people are busy and don t have the time to check emails
it would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone    i know some people prefer texts to emails    but if you re in a work situation _comma_  how do you ensure communication?
text and emails are still the best option .  _comma_  until a nw way is created . 
i recently had a big argument with my sister .  we both got very upset and angry at each other . 
isn t that what sisters are for?  what were you guys upset about?
i m not so sure .  we just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying . 
maybe once you feel like you can bring it up again _comma_  you can try to approach the topic from another angle . 
i felt most lonely when we first moved overseas _comma_  my husband then had to travel out of  that  country for business    and i had a new baby!
congratulations! where did you travel from and where did you end up?
from santa fe to hong kong    ultimately a fantastic adventure .  and i ended up with a wonderful group of friends .  expats bond quickly!
that must have been quite the culture shock _comma_  glad it all worked out though!
one of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and or are capable of . 
i know _comma_  that actually happens to me sometimes! last year i didn t get accepted into this fellowship and for a couple of weeks i was underestimating myself a lot . 
that s perfectly natural .  you sound like the kind of person  _comma_   though  _comma_   that quickly regained their bearings .  disappointments like that usually come with some  good  lessons . 
yea for sure _comma_  i definitely learned that sometimes life just works in a funny way .  when s the last time you have been really disappointed? 
once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but i told her anyway .   i really felt bad b c he got pretty upset with me . 
i totally understand why he was mad .  why did you tell her?
yeah thats a good question .   i totally deserved him being mad .   i just felt bad for him b c he was so busy that day and i didn t want him to have one more thing on his plate i guess
i guess he wanted to be available if she needed him . 
there was a back neighbor that called my    year old son a ugly name one time _comma_  simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner . !
what is a back neighbor? and that is crazy!
yes    _comma_     she lived several house back and she didn t know me    _comma_     until after she did that! she knew me then    _comma_     but after i talked to her    _comma_     she apologized to both of us .  
oh my! i m glad she apologized!
too often _comma_  it s a health scare that makes us value health .  it inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day . 
i understand .  i am think the same thing .  what is your health issue?
happily  _comma_   i don t have one! it s more seeing family and friends and the situations they re in .  not everything can be helped    but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves  _comma_   you know?
yes _comma_  we should try to yourself heathy
every time i look through older photos of my children   _comma_    i m taken right back to the time they were that size   _comma_    and what we were doing! it s a bittersweet feeling   _comma_    for sure . 
oh  _comma_   it sure is  _comma_   i feel the same way .  they grow up so fast! 
are your kids adults now?
one of them is! i have an    year old and a    year old . 
i have an    year old as well    i don t know about you _comma_  but it s hard to consider her an adult sometimes!
i have a hard time having confidence in myself but when i got married and i had my hair and makeup done i felt like i was beautiful!  i had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!
i bet you were beautiful on that day .  :) i hope that confidence has carried on since then!
i really try but it s hard to replicate that day for sure . 
it would be hard to replicate that day for sure _comma_  but i bet you have a lot to be confident about .  you got this!
my husband and i both work for ourselves    a blessing and a curse at times _comma_  since it can be tough to determine a  regular  income . 
i bet it s tough .  a regular income is nice but the freedom you get from working for yourselfs is better .  
we found a pretty good balance in that i have a part time job that i  love     and that comes with benefits like insurance .  that s a big worry addressed _comma_  right there . 
your so lucky .  insurance is my number one worry every month .  
i am sorry _comma_  because i absolutely know that concern .  i truly hope you find a resolution to that . 
i met up with an old flame recently _comma_  didn t go how i expected
oh ya? what happened?? i m intrigued
well  _comma_   right after she gave me a big hug  _comma_   she introduced me to her new boyfriend . 
woah plot twist .  she brought him along to meet you? 
i know right! no warning or anything .  he turned out to be a nice guy _comma_  but i thought it was a little misleading on her part . 
my family and i are going on vacation in a few weeks .  we rented a largo beachfront condo and i can t wait!
oh i love the beach!!  which beach are you going to go to?
we are going to be staying at miramar beach in florida _comma_  about an  hour panama city beach .  the view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!
pcb is where we always go! if you want to drive a little bit _comma_  go to hunts in pcb   it s off the beaten path but the best seafood and prices   just go early (like  oclock) for dinner or you won t get in!!
i was supposed to go for brunch with my friend maria the other day .  at least that was the plan . 
why didn t you go?
well  _comma_   we had initially agreed to meet at    .  wouldn t you know it  _comma_   she didn t end up returning my text until  pm!
is she always a flake? maybe time for a new friend?
me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!
did he do anything to you and your mom?
well i knew he was following us and so i asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b c he was waiting on us .   so scary!
i am glad that nothing happened . 
did i tell you what happened with li the other night? boy do i feel dumb . 
no _comma_  you didn t tell me! what happened?
she s    minutes late to our anniversary dinner .  i don t know what happened to me but i called and left an angry message .  turns out _comma_  she had gotten t boned at an intersection and was talking to the police officer when i called!
oh no! is she okay?! don t beat yourself up too much _comma_  you couldn t have ever imagined that she had been in an accident . 
ugh! i looked like such a fool at my girlfriend s work party! 
what happened?
well  _comma_   i ended up having way too much to drink .  one of her co workers had a bottle of fireball (gross i know) and was making everybody do shots .  i didn t want to look foolish  _comma_   so i had .  well too many . 
i love fireball . 
did i tell you what happened with the concert i was supposed to go to saturday?
no _comma_  what happened?
well first of all _comma_  it wasn t just any concert   it was jay z and beyonce! and it got rained out! 
thats horrible .  will they reschedule?
you are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when i got home from new york . 
who _comma_  tell me!
my friend benny! the one we all thought died in a monsoon in thailand!
wow _comma_  what happened?
recently  _comma_   my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for mother s day .  he had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts  _comma_   it was very unexpected!
that is very nice gift .  did you bought anything for him for father s day?
i did! i also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy .  i was very touched by him being so thoughtful!
that is great . 
i know i shouldn t count my chicks before they hatch _comma_  but i m feeling pretty good after that interview today!
oh what job was the interview for?
this advertising company! the owner was there   you should have seen his face .  my last freelance project was a real winner .  think i got it?
i think you got it man! congratz!
did i ever tell you about the time i  got taken hostage ?
oh my  are you really serious?
as a heart attack .  it was me and big c at the world s largest pistachio .  all of the sudden we hear gunshots   _comma_    and didi s still in the car .  we ran in the building   _comma_    and he comes flying in after us .  he never pointed the gun at us   _comma_    and we ended up running away when he was distracted .  it s too crazy   i can t make this up .  just glad to be alive!
i am very glad it has a happy ending .  sounds a bit scary
i went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me .  he actually suddenly kissed me _comma_  as i was waiting for my friend to return .  i couldn t believe his nerve!
oh no _comma_  what did you do?
i quietly pushed him away  _comma_   as i didn t want my friend to hear .  i was so shocked and upset  _comma_   since he knew i wouldn t want to make a scene and took advantage . 
did you ever tell your friend?  
this past friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! we had to go the weekend without it _comma_  and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! it wasn t a fun weekend for us!
oh no _comma_  i hate when that happens .  i can sympathize with you because thats happen to me twice! its okay in the winter time and you can sort of keep your food fresh but not during the summer
yes  _comma_   and of course we tried to call and have someone come out  _comma_   but to no avail! you don t realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren t working!
i wish refrigerators would have a warranty that replaced food when they went bad .  
i felt pretty bad when i was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners .  her boyfriend had made a pass at me _comma_  but i never told her about it .  
wao _comma_  you must fell weird about it! what you thinki to do about it?
i felt bad   _comma_    but she wasn t working and taking care of her grandchild   _comma_    and her boyfriend was the financial support .  i knew it would really be hard on her if she found out   _comma_    not to mention she really loves him . 
super tough situation  _comma_   i think you should let her know  _comma_   and let her decides next
i was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: time to go mommy! and i wasnt her _comma_  can you imagine my reaction to it?
oh  _comma_   i m sure you were embarrassed! but  _comma_   maybe you can laugh about it now?
yes  _comma_   totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth  _comma_   didn t know were to hide! and my mom was watching
well _comma_  i m sure mom had a laugh lol! i can imagine how you felt at the time though!
the good thing about it   _comma_    was the lady   _comma_    she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to   _comma_    no worries!
i am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! we have a condo reserved on the beach _comma_  with fantastic ocean views .  i m ready!
ah _comma_  that sounds fantastic! which ocean will you be enjoying?
well  _comma_   we are staying at panama city beach  _comma_   so we re right there at the gulf of mexico . 
sounds awesome! do you have a beachside beverage or traditions that you enjoy? (mine would be tequila   lime . very jimmy buffett ; ))
i am definitely a proud parent of our    year old    she was determined to work this summer _comma_  and even with us saying no one would hire her until       she found a job!
well _comma_  that s impressive! i can see why you are proud .  sounds like a hard working young lady!
that _comma_  and she s enjoying the independence of having her own money .  remember that? making money that you truly could use for your  pleasure  (and not just necessities ?! ; ))
yes _comma_  i was the same way too! i started working two days after i turned    so i could have my own money too!
same! i was surprised    year olds  can  actually work during the summer .  it s just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut way back once school starts . 
okay _comma_  a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless    when people just leave their grocery carts willy nilly in the parking lot .  no consideration for others or the people who work at the store!
absolutely i agree i always try to not even bring cart unless i have too many too carry . 
me too .  and i will always make sure to at  least  put it in one of those cart corrals _comma_  if not walk it back up to the store .  hey    extra exercise ; )
yes me too now if everyone would just take our lead lol
we can save the wooooooorld!!!!! (lol indeed . !)
i came home  _comma_   and my wife showed me a picture in  d of our future baby  _comma_   my heart speeded so fast!
oh wow .  do you know whether it will be a boy or girl yet?
we choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before . 
first time parent?
yes _comma_  god willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second
i love being in the  flow     whether it s in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings . 
what kind of work do you do?
i work with different organizations on strengthening their culture _comma_  and i do large scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording) .  are you familiar with that at all? (not unusual not to be!)
actually i m not  _comma_   but it sounds very interesting and by working with different organizations  _comma_   i would imagine it s also exciting and new every day . 
that s one of the huge benefits    learning about many different industries and subjects!
i love when leaders know that it actually  helps  them to be surrounded by strong people    people they can learn from  _comma_   that challenge them  _comma_   and that in some ways could be considered  better  . 
i agree _comma_  its always nice to have people around you who are smarter in some areas
it s just too many leaders want  yes men  and or people who feel non threatening .  it s a trap and a quick path to mediocrity _comma_  if not failure!
yes men are definitely a bad idea when it comes to life and business
i ll always remember the day i learned i was pregnant with our first child    halloween in chicago _comma_  and we were with friends at the shedd aquarium! i ve loved baby belugas since ; )
baby belugas are cute _comma_  but not as cute as your baby!
ha! true that ; ) that s also the year that a bug s life came out  _comma_   and we always thought of our young one as  dot   _comma_   the spunky little girl ant in the movie . 
that is so funny! i don t think she ll want to be compared to an ant when she gets older .  you ll have to remind her . 
this mother s day was amazing! i got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt
that is great!!  sometimes we mom s get a bit forgotten _comma_  so to have an entire day where we are just loved is such a great feeling . 
yes _comma_  definitely! i actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards 
those words are the things we cherish more than any other thing _comma_  i love it when my girls do that!
that s too bad .  what do you think went wrong?
i am not sure _comma_  it was pretty random
did they give you any feedback?
no _comma_  nothing at all
that is a shame _comma_  you need to learn from your mistakes . 
i know
so my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant .  her and her husband are so excited .  i hope they have an amazing   months and then an amazing time raising the baby . 
that is exciting news!  i bet you were so surprised!
i was very surprised .  she didn t tell a single person they were trying for a baby .  just announced it on the  th of july
ha!  what a neat day to announce it   did they do any special kind of announcement?  i see so many videos of interesting and neat ways to make that announcement . 
yes _comma_  they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it .  so exciting
oh no _comma_  what did you do instead? did you watch netflix?
i do watch netflix sometimes .   do you watch?
yes _comma_  i do .  i recently watched the series  dark .   it s the german one . 
i haven t heard of that one .   what genre does it fall in?
it s a supernatural mystery type .  i won t spoil the twist . 
sounds interesting!
it was fantastic  _comma_   a lot of people have been comparing it to stranger things  _comma_   but its a lot more grime and serious . 
i went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer _comma_  and i felt great about it since i was so prepared with all of the documents and everything i needed to show the court i was in the right for quitting . 
did it go your way?
yes _comma_  i actually ended up winning it and they gave me   months of unemployment pay . 
that is great   have you found another job yet?
 yes i am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse .  i love it .  much better than my last job
today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!
i hate traffic too _comma_  it makes me angry
yes! people were constantly cutting me off _comma_ not signalling and slamming on their brakes
people are so rude when they drive these days
the grudge scared me when i was    to which i couldn t navigate my own house . 
i can imagine! that was a terrifying movie . 
and yet i still felt as if i had to see the sequels when they came out too . 
that happened to me too .  with the other exorcist movies and the ring movies .  even though they scared me _comma_  i was too curious to not see the others . 
my best friend did amazing in school _comma_  despite having   children and not doing great academically in school .  she ended up getting honors in her first   semesters . 
she sounds like a person with great ability .  great choice of friend . 
she has been my friend for    years .  she pushes me to do better too . 
that s great .  i wish i had someone so close like that!
i hope you find someone like that .  i believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that . 
today when i went outside to check my new banana plant i noticed the new leaf was turning brown . 
is that a bad sign? perhaps the plant is not getting enough nutrition or sunlight?
i don t think that s the problem .  i am worried about a drainage issue .  i m going to check back in a couple days . 
oh _comma_  i see .  i am not much of a horticulturist but it makes sense that it could be over saturated . 
i m new to growing bananas and from what i understand they can be very sensitive to over watering .  it was doing great before today .  possibly wind too .  
i decided a few months i was ready for a puppy _comma_  so i put the word out
put what word ? you mean published the info?
basically _comma_  yes .  i made a classified ad .  i was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!
so what breed did you get ?
when i bought my first house i put down   % of the loan _comma_  which made me broke quick .  my monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until i got on my feet .  so grateful for them
i would be too! you did what you had to do!
yes  _comma_   i am always better off with them as my parents  _comma_   they want to see us succeed
do you find the home buying experience worth it?
yes _comma_  it was well worth it! i love being independant .  teaches you a lot . 
how long do you plan on staying in that house?
maybe   more years then i am ready for something bigger .  probably when i get married
well that s awesome! i m happy for you!
my friend is a surgeon and we were discussing salary .  he easily makes     _comma_     a year and he is only    .  it s crazy and i was jealous of him . 
you shouldn t _comma_  because that is  a very stressful job
yeah  _comma_   that s a good point .  i also realized he has a high malpractice insurance  _comma_   and is on call a lot . 
and don t forget how many years they have to study in order to get a license for surgery
true .  he went to college for    years! the student loans are probably high too . 
i am in college and i was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future
really? do you know what you want to do when you graduate? i know sometimes it s tough to settle on a path . 
i want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn t set in stone .  i am thrilled to start my new career path
that sounds like a great career plan .  you will be filling a very important role in the physician s practice!
that is disgusting! what can you do about about it?
i m not sure .  what would you do?
you could chat to them and complain!
maybe i will try that .  do you think it will work?
who knows _comma_  i guess it depends on how reasonable they are .  
one time when i was kicked out of the place i was staying at _comma_  my best friend immediately told me i could stay with her until i got on my feet . 
oh no _comma_  that sounds like an awful situation .  what did you end up doing after that?
i stayed with her for about a year until i got my own apartment .  we are getting an apartment together in a few months . 
so exciting! it can be fun to have a roommate
she also has   daughters  _comma_     and    _comma_   and a few crested geckos too so i ll have a bunch of roommates . 
i love that .  lots of new friends _comma_  haha
i ve known them since the moment they were born _comma_  but it will still be a blast . 
last week when toys r us closed it really made me start thinking of the   s and my childhood
i ve heard a lot of people say something similar .  did you go there a lot?
i did! i was talking to my husband about the different toys i had .  even started talking about the music and shows from that era
where i grew up didn t have one nearby so i get a little jealous hearing about it . 
the other day i came across a facebook post showing all the old stuff from the    s .  it took me way back to my childhood . 
good lord you must have had facebook for a long time! i started mine in college so there isn t anything from my younger years . 
oh no     _comma_      it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends     _comma_      food     _comma_      toys     _comma_      tv shows     _comma_      etc .  i had facebook back in      but not earlier than that . 
oh ok lol .  i completely understand .  i had a friend share a post about making mix tapes from the radio with a cassette player .  totally remember doing that!
how old are you? were you a child in the   s? i am    so i grew up during the   s . 
i am    :)
oh so only a few years older than me .  i love the feeling of nostalgia though .  i pretty much live for it . 
i hate bullies .  playground or politics _comma_  i find them intolerable . 
me too _comma_  bullies are part of the reason that i homeschooled . 
good for you! did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?
well _comma_  i was referring to my own kids .  they have adjusted well at    and    . 
i expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good . 
i also saw it and felt like it was pretty good .  much better than the my little pony movie .  that was torture . 
oh i can t imagine .  i don t think i would pay more than a quarter to see that movie . 
yeah it was so boring .  even my kids got bored and they had been dying to see it _comma_ 
my parents keep taking my money
that s not nice of them .  why do they keep taking it??
they need it for other stuff .  i never get a chance to save any of it . 
sorry to hear that .  i found that it helps to have multiple savings accounts  _comma_   so whenever you get a certain amount of money (like     _comma_      ) save it and be strict not to spend it . 
so when adults don t clean up after themselves in a business environment    what is that ?! why do they think a  mommy  will come along to clean up after them?!
lol! this is perfect timing because i had the   you are an adult not a child  conversation with my girlfriend not too long ago .  i had left popsicle wrapper on the night stand and it got sticky .  i argued if you are willing to date someone who likes to eat popsicles in bed _comma_  then you have to deal with the consequences .  
lol! okay  _comma_   y all are a sitcom .  i have to ask what flavor .  (and yes  _comma_   i side with your girlfriend .  if for no other reason: ants .  you do not want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions .  okuuurrrrrr?)
okay        _comma_         it wasn t just one        _comma_         it was three: one cherry        _comma_         and two grape .  how anyone can eat just one at a time? oh        _comma_         the number of wrappers was also brought up .  like        _comma_         i don t care if yuo bought them for the kids        _comma_         i am part of this household as well .  i tried to make it a teaching moment about how if you don t get the popsicles first someone else would        _comma_         but i think my arguments have been falling on deaf ears for awhile now        _comma_         lol
the hardest time in my life was when my best friend died on christmas of      . 
wow .  i m so sorry to hear that .  that would be incredibly hard .  what happened?
she fell off of a roof .  she fell asleep and when she got up _comma_  she slipped . 
that s horrible .  i m really sorry about your friend .  
it has been a long time so i have come to cope with it _comma_  but sometimes it s still hard .  i named my daughter after her .  her name is roxie . 
that s a beautiful name! it s cool you honored your friend in that way .  
it really helped me heal when i was able to do that . 
i can t even imagine .  i ve never lost anyone super close to me yet . 
a few years ago _comma_  there was a time that i really needed a car .  i had to go to school and my husband worked full time .  
did you not have a car? that s hard .  i don t have one now and use uber and lyft all the time . 
we had one car we shared but i had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides .  we didn t really have uber and lydt yet .  but someone gave me a car out of the blue!
that is incredible! i swear some things in life are determined by fate .  i m glad you were able to get a car . 
thanks me too .  it blew me away that people can be so kind .  
it s incredible _comma_  and so important .  that s why i try to pass on the kindness whenever i am able . 
have you ever had a surprise birthday party planned for you? i did a few years back . 
yes . my first was when i turned    . 
that s awesome! what a good year to do it .  i remember begging my husband to throw me one every year .  
lol . you had to beg your husband for a surprise party??
haha! yes! and what s really funny _comma_  is that i almost missed it because i wasn t actually expecting it and almost didn t get back in time! whoops .  
it was raining hard one night and the power shut off
did you have candles or a flash light to help yous see?
only lighters .  now we are stocked on candles 
well atleast you have something to help you guys . 
one time i studied my butt off for my first psychology exam .  it was hard and i studied all night . 
how did you do
i ended up actually getting a   %!
that is great! my b . s .  ( i always hate saying that because i have to say i have my bs in psychology) is in psychology . 
haha i always thought that was a funny term too .  that s amazing .  psychology is absolutely fascinating . 
do you have any pets?
pet? like dogs and other?
yes .  we got a cat not too long  ago and he drives me crazy! he s such a night owl and is always banging into stuff .  
wow _comma_  seriously i hate those pets being around me
my son graduated .  
from where?
highschool . 
congrats  _comma_ that s a step forward
one of the hardest times in my life was when i had to leave my husband and daughter when i went through a divorce . 
i am so sorry .  i can t imagine what you must have went through . 
i felt like i had no one .  the two people i loved most in life i barely saw and was disconnected from . 
that must have been really hard .  
it was  _comma_   but i grew so much from it  _comma_   and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me . 
i know this guy who is so young _comma_  yet he owns his own major business .  it s really impressive . 
really?  what kind of work does he do?
he owns his own coffee shop .  he started roasting when he was    and now he s only    but distributes beans across the country . 
wow .  that is impressive .   are you guys still friends?  maybe he could get you a job in one of his stores . 
i feel slightly bad .  i think i hurt my mom s feelings last week because she told me about a necklace i got rid of when i was a kid .  she s a packrat and i m really _comma_  really not . 
awww .  reminds me of the show hoarders when the family members argue over silly things like that .   what was the necklace all about did you make it or something?
i feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show .  :  i m all about less stuff to pick up! lol eh . it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant .  it said  special sister  .  i m probably a jerk . 
well why did you have it if it belonged to them?  did you pawn it?
no _comma_  they bought it for me .  i think i was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back .  lol she said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that s sweet . 
thats sweet of them .  maybe you could make it up to her buy getting her a special mom necklace with your spare cash . 
have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? like an escape?
all the time .   that is part of listening to music i suppose .   the songs remind you of when you first heard them . 
yeah _comma_  i guess that s fair .  it happens all the time to me too .  sometimes makes me wish i was reliving those moments but i don t think i would really want to go back . 
i know what you mean .   however _comma_  the older i get the more i want to go back lol . 
lol :) that s true .  life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when i was younger _comma_  but i just don t like who i was .  i like me now much better :)
i was just thinking about how a few years ago _comma_  we lost our cat . 
oh no!  what happened to it?
it was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn t come back that night .  he was hit by a car .  :(
so sad!  i am sorry .   don t feel too bad its natural for them to want to be outside . 
thank you .  i appreciate that .  
i m sorry to hear that .  i had a dog die once too . 
it is so sad to know but my mother is rather sick of flu and not dying 
the flu sure makes it feel like you re dying haha
oh yes but it is not as bad and you cannot call it dying like in cancer patient 
agreed _comma_  definitely not .  i actually work in radiation oncology and see cancer every day at work . 
once i ate a raw oyster because my uncle offered me some and i contracted food poisoning .  things were coming out from both ends _comma_  so gross . 
did you get sick afterwards 
extremely  _comma_   but it passed after a day or so .  never consume raw shellfish  _comma_   unless sushi because they properly prepare it
i do not think sushi is that good too .  the best option is to stop eating them in any form of food
you don t care for sushi that much?
i recently had a prank played on me .  my friend pretended to be dead and used ketchup as a prop!
damn that sounds like a pretty good one! how did that turn out?
i ended up being very upset at first and then laughed it off!
that s how all pranks should be!
my boyfriend of five years and i broke up .  i don t know what to do with my life . 
i am so sorry to hear that .  is there any chance you might be able to reconcile???
i don t think so .  he wants to join the military since his dad has passed away and i m not sure if that s the lifestyle i want . 
oh that s too bad .  ): i don t want to overstep but i always like to encourage people to hold on to their love for each other no matter what trials come up .  
i think we re going to try long distance while i finish up school (  more years) .  but it s just scary thinking of it all . 
i think that s good! if you are meant to be together you ll feel it and it will work out i think _comma_  if you just keep your conviction and stick with it .  good luck with it! 
we have dogs and chameleons together _comma_  so it s like we re already a little family haha
aw _comma_  that s sweet! i really am hoping y all make it through this together .  (:
i recently found out the girl i love may not feel the same way .  this makes me sad . 
so sad _comma_ you can never force someone to love you .  you will find the right person for you . 
i hope so .  maybe one day _comma_  but i am not so sure . 
don t give up on love . it the best feeling ever to experience .  wish you well . 
i feel pretty hopeful towards this woman that i really enjoy .  i am trying to date her . 
do you have a good chance with her .  have you talked to her about it?
i think she has expressed interest in me in the past  _comma_   but she recently moved  _comma_   but she is not too far away .  i might ask her on a date the next time i am around . 
that will be better .  talk to her before you lose her
i am very lucky _comma_  my friends are so great .  what s the best birthday you have had?
probably one where i got a limo with all my friends and went to this restaurant  _comma_   it was great .  what about yours  _comma_   what makes your friends so great too?
wow _comma_  i am impressed! my friends just show me love and buy me tequila aha!
i wish my friends bought me alcohol _comma_  that would make for a hell of a night! 
for sure _comma_  maybe you need new friends!
hi are you there?
i recently had an argument with my sister .  it made us both very annoyed . 
that must be hard i always wished i had a sister though i have a brother 
i recently had a scary experience .  i heard gunshots on my street . 
oh my! you must have been terrified! did everything turn out ok?
everything turned out fine .  i think somebody in the nearby neighborhoods may have been hurt _comma_  though . 
that is not good at all .  that is a very scary situation . 
do you know the feeling of drinking a mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows on a cold winter s night?
i have not tried yet _comma_  but i feel like it would be enjoying and full of delight
next time you get a cold front in your area you should try it .  it s extremely relaxing and sleep inducing haha
i live in a place where it only snows once in    years .  so _comma_  i think i am passing on that
i live in louisiana _comma_  so it s very rare that i get to enjoy it .  i ve had it maybe three or four times in my lifetime .  it just left a lasting impression . 
i love my mom .  she does her best to provide for me _comma_  even to this day . 
you are so lucky .  mums are the best .  what do you do for her?
i tell her i love her and also send her gifts from time to time .  she doesn t live too close to me but i try . 
you should spend time with her whilst you can .  my mum died and i wish i had been with her more . 
you know  _comma_   that is tough  _comma_   but it happens to the best of us .  what went wrong?
nothing went wrong _comma_  we just have different lives in different places .  i go visit every now and then . 
but you failed the exam? did you revise?
i did not revise .  sometimes exams are failed and things are not corrected . 
at least you know for next time eh?
my mom helped me buy a car .  she s the best . 
that is great that you have an awesome mom!
she s amazing .  do you love your mom?
yes i do love my mom very much . 
i think that the girl of my dreams likes somebody else .  i feel very sad about it . 
ooh _comma_  am so sorry about that .  have you tried to talk to her?
it s tough because she has been out of the country for a month _comma_  so i will likely discuss it when she returns . 
that will help you know her stand on your relationship
that sounds tough .  what do you do 
well i am a mover so i have to bring heavy furniture up and down stairs . 
that sounds like hard work .  i hope you are paid well . 
it pays decent and feeds the kids so i can t complain . 
fair enough .  as long as you look after your back 
i have only a few more semesters in college .  i feel very hopeful about my chances of finishing . 
that s awesome .  what are you majoring in?
environmental engineering! i enjoy it _comma_  but i wouldn t say it is my passion in life . 
sometimes it s good to have something you enjoy make money so you can pursue your passion without worrying about it . 
i watch so many scary movies that i haven t been able to sleep alone in years due to fear .  
that is such a bummer .  why did you keep watching them?
i honestly don t know .  i ve always been fascinated with them since being a little girl and that fascination has never gone away . 
i understand being fascinated by them they can be very intriguing .  maybe you should stop watching as many though .  
i ve been telling myself that for years _comma_  i just have no self control .  what are your favorite kinds of movies?
i like scary movies as well so i know how addicting they can be . 
what is your favorite scary movie at the moment?
it is actually  scream .   
donald trump is now the president .  it makes me feel bad about life . 
oh yeah _comma_  donald trump is such a charlatan .  he has some really shady history too .  i m actually a christian and a conservative but i m appalled that everyone on the  right  have fallen for this guy .  he s so against what the real conservative values are supposed to be . 
i agree .  i am glad real conservatives are in opposition to him _comma_  too . 
yeah _comma_  i am sad about the whole left vs .  right thing in general .  ultimately we should all be uniting against the corrupt people that are running amok in the government .  
i am now going to be a master s student .  i will got to he university of florida
awwww .  congratulations .  what is your major
environmental engineering is my major .  i enjoy it . 
lovely .  thats really great .  wishing you all the best
i have been feeling very faithful these days .  my lover treats me so well . 
that is interesting _comma_  how does he buy you stuff or is he just really nice?
he is really nice and provides for me well .  he is also very sweet and very respectful . 
i am happy for you wish i could find a nice lover like that . 
do you like to go through old family pictures?
yes _comma_  i think they offer a great bridge to the past .  do you?
absolutely .  i love to hear my mámá tell me stories from her childhood trapping nutria and trawling with her family . 
that s great .  it sounds like a very good situation to be in . 
i also love to look through the old scrapbooks my mom made when i was a baby and young child .  i find it s so funny to see what you looked like as a child . 
i recently found out that the woman of my dreams like another .  i am incredibly jealous of him . 
:( i m very sorry .  have you tried telling her how you feel? that could affect her decision . 
i have not told her as much as i need to .  i am trying to build the courage . 
i know it s hard to build the confidence needed to do something like that _comma_  but you don t want to keep them to yourself .  if you really think she is the woman of your dreams then you have to try
how long?
i m not quite following .  anything you want to tell me about?
about what exactly?
well did you have any story or anything that you had in mind that you wanted to tell me? i told you a story of mine before so you owe me haha . 
now that is an interesting perspective!
my mother recently went to the bank for me .  i love her so much . 
that is really nice of her .   it is nice to have someone to help you do things sometimes . 
nice people are the best .  empathy is something we all need more of!
yes .   too many people these days are mean to one another!
my father almost died .  his recent health problems have been devastating . 
that s so sad _comma_  i hope you ve gotten over it . 
it is tough _comma_  but i think i will make it . 
that s good _comma_  death is a natural part of life . 
my friend bought a new car .  this makes me so jealous!
no _comma_ u don t have to be 
it makes me feel inferior .  hopefully i will get over it . 
yes _comma_ u will surely get over it
i recently met a new person that i am very fond of .  i want to give her my love and care . 
that is very special and i am so happy for you . 
i am very happy _comma_  too .  do you have someone special in your life?
yes _comma_  married for    years and it is still great . 
my family is very loving .  they care about me so much . 
that s good to have a loving family . 
i agree .  i hope you are also close to your family!
i am i love them very much .  however we live on opposite parts of the country . 
i stole my friend s pokemon card when we were   .  i still feel guilty about it . 
wow _comma_    years? you were really young then
yes
but did you tell your friend about it later?
i one time lost my trunks in the pool! people saw me in a way i didn t want!
oh no! that must have been super embarrassing! how did you react to that?
i covered my body and then went to the bathroom and got a towel!
my goodness _comma_  well i guess that happens to all of us at least once . 
i recently graduated from college .  i loved it and now i feel great about my life!
that sounds fun _comma_  starting a new life is always great!
i agree .  i am thinking about moving to the west coast of the usa . 
west coast is fun _comma_  but it can be expensive . 
we went for a doctor visit because she was 
because she was what?
sorry lol .  because she was  late  .  but she told me the result was negative _comma_  not pregnant .  so then we went to a furniture store just to browse

the house is very quiet now that she s been gone for four days visiting with her family
why did she go visiting?
because she hasn t seen them in almost   years .  misses them

i was getting keys out of my pocket  _comma_   and then wham  _comma_   right on the floor .  the pineapple slices were the first to fall on the floor . 
why does mcdonalds always get my order wrong! i said no lettuce!
report to their management
sometimes i think the management don t even care!
just give it a trial
i ate so much of my wife s cookies _comma_  but she shouldn t make them so irresistible .  
haha _comma_  how did she feel when she found out?
she made me pay twice what they would have sold for at the bake sale .  the cookies were for charity _comma_  you see . 
oh no! those cookies sure do sound delicious though . 
just my luck i step into a huge pile of dog mess . 
dang  _comma_   i hated that .  at least it s not cow poop  _comma_   that s worst .  
that is true _comma_  cow poop is much worst! but i was wearing brand new gucci flip flops! 
oh man  _comma_   you gotta super clean it  _comma_   have the professionals do it even 
the key to making good chicken and rice _comma_  is following the recipe precisely 
how do you make it?
you ve got to cut up all the ingredients  _comma_   and put it in small containers  _comma_   before finally cooking all at once . 
good to know .   i will do it like it next time . 
we asked the doc to put the ultrasound in an envelope so we could record our reaction to the gender reveal .  i was very happy when i finally saw it!

that s great my man! i can t wait for my first son .  so far   daughters :(
holy moses!! don t quit trying :)
my son failed his exams! can you believe it! i don t know what to do!
don t panic _comma_  and don t be harsh on the kid .  perhaps spend time going over the subject together? or maybe he s having other trouble that s affecting his studies
he spent all his time playing football instead of studying! i warned him about this!
it s better to do what you re passionate about .  do that and success follows
without prayer _comma_  i don t know if i would have passed that important test!
that s cool .   for what class
it was a test in numeracy  _comma_   so counting         .  i ve always found that difficult  _comma_   but god made it possible!
god works in mysterious ways
hey! i saw a blind man play a guitar once .  was so surreal and i was so impressed
wow .  i would be too .  i love guitar _comma_  it s my favorite musical instrument .  i wonder if he was born blind
yea .  i think he was .  his story was crazy too .  he is an orphan 
just goes to show that people can be amazing .  just never give up _comma_  persistence is the key
we were    mins from the airport and the car broke down _comma_  overheated and would not start !

must have been quite a sight .  
my best friend is doing    years in prison .  i miss my good friend .

my son worked for many years to be a footballer _comma_  he finally signed a pro contract!
wow _comma_  that is a great news
he s just joined juventus .  can t be more happy for the lad .

on my way home from work _comma_  a massive bat chased me!
holy moses! i hate them things .  flying rats is what they are . 
i know! this one was absolutely huge  _comma_   almost human sized .  chased me for a whole hour .  the more i think about it  _comma_   it might have been the batman! i shouldn t have stolen those diamonds!
lol .  don t do the crime if can t face the bat ;)
every day i thank god for my blessings .  i d be in hole right now if it weren t for him
praise god man! he really is amazing and we should always be grateful for we have 
especially since he takes care of us even though don t deserve it
amen! so true .  its especially awesome when he picks us up in every fall .  his love never fails
once during an important school sporting event  _comma_   my entire sports team was counting on me but mid way through my event  _comma_   my shorts fell down and i tripped 
for real? that must ve been embarrassing .  sorry to hear about that
yea! it was! i thought everyone would be annoyed at me but the next day when i went back to school _comma_  everyone just made it a joke so its alright .  this was about     years ago now haha
well that s good and bad .  hopefully the joke didn t carry on too long
i love youtube .  been listening to all my classic tracks .  tupac forever
i love me some tupac .  real talk . 
i started out with one hit wonders but ended up at pac .  i miss my youth lol
me too .  i always end up on the   s hip hop station on pandora . 
when i was younger   _comma_    my dog died .  he was getting up there in age   _comma_    but he was still on the young side .  later   _comma_    we heard the pet food we had been feeding him had been recalled because of similiar fatalities . 
sorry to hear that .  did someone do anything against the company selling the food?
no  _comma_   they just had a recall .  apparently they didn t clean out their machines properly when making the food  _comma_   so it got contaminated .  
someone should have sued them . 
seeing people who have less than me just makes me so grateful for the blessings i have been given
oh yes  _comma_   at least  _comma_   you will be in a position to help them in return
absolutely! always give to people who have less than myself :) 
that is good .  you have a good heart
hiding for almost   years but i m still not over my paranoia that one day i will have to pay for what i did .  don t ask what it was
you must feel awful  _comma_    why don t you come clean  _comma_   maybe you will feel better . 
no way .  i just pray she can forgive me .  i could never admit to this sin .  jesus save me
yes jesus can save you if you ask him .   he always forgive . 
when i was a kid     _comma_      i went to this group with other kids my age     _comma_      it was in a big gym .  there were kids of different ages     _comma_      and one of the kids (  years old or so) was picking on the littler kids .  so     _comma_      when he had his back turned     _comma_      i looped him with a hoola hoop and tripped him so he fell flat on his face . 
he deserved that _comma_  i think . 
yeah         _comma_          i was pretty amazed in the moment         _comma_          he was flat as a board in mid air before he landed flat on his face .  i had to watch for a moment in awe         _comma_          before i realized he was getting up and i was about to get smacked .  so         _comma_          i ran towards where the parents were seated         _comma_          stopped when i turned the corner         _comma_          and walked calmly over to my mom         _comma_          taking a seat on her lap .  i looked innocent as could be as the mean kid came around the corner         _comma_          and i forced myself to sit still so that when he smacked me in the face with the hoola hoop         _comma_          i looked like a helpless victim . 
wow _comma_  interesting . 
after she got her  st job and new car _comma_  she started doing girls night out .  out until  am one morning .  i checked her chat history and sure enough she had kissed another guy  :(
wow _comma_  you must have felt jealous
jealous isn t the one i felt .  i wanted to rip her apart lol
hahahaa  _comma_   its not easy though  _comma_   i would have done same
my dad always worked his ass off at a job he didn t like in order to support us _comma_  doing a lot of back breaking work as a caretaker .  he even had a second job at wal mart for a while .  i have no idea how he managed to do that sort of thing . 
when you have responsibilities that you really care about  _comma_   you do what you have to .  i commend him .  its hard raising a family  _comma_  
yeah  _comma_   especially because we were single income .  my mom homeschooled my brother and i .  i think he took only a handful of sick days his entire time working  _comma_   had something like     days saved up when he retired . 
oh wow .  ive never heard of that many sick days . 
i think he got   weeks a year _comma_  only used like   days . 
cool . 
my instincts are never wrong .  i found out her lies when i checked her facebook chat history .  
so _comma_  what was she lying to you about?
she arranged to meet up with her ex to return his t shirt! why do that behind my back? we had just started seeing each other .  made me so mad
oh _comma_  she shouldn t have done that
i never thought she would tell anyone and make it seem like i did something wrong .  i didn t force her
oh no how horrible
ye and so i had to leave the country because of her
oh no
public school really sucks sometimes .  making boys shower all together .  i didn t want to but had to or else fail pe
i hate public schools ooo
yes .  well it was a long time ago but i haven t forgotten
but it s really cool atimes
my mom homeschooled me when i was little .  i was in public school till first grade _comma_  but after that i was homeschooled .  did take a semester in grade    though to make sure i was up to current standards . 
thats cool _comma_  i did online school in high school
really? i didn t even know that was an option .  then again i m    so it may not have been available then . 
well were pretty close in age
i still haven t got over it .  brandon lee rip .  i was    when i found out he died during filming .  i visited the area he took his last steps a couple years ago
i remember him _comma_  he was going to be a great actor . 
now the remake is well on its way .  maybe it can lift this depression i feel if they stay true to the story .  jason mamoa isn t bad looking
yeah he might do a pretty good job as that character . 
i had to adapt to life .  i had to change to survive .  now i feel better
adapting to life is always good to do . 
i am reminded every day that i can survive anything .  a friend gave me a special bracelet (paracord)
thats a great attitude to have .  you should keep with that . 
i recently found out a good friend of mine has been cheating on her fiance for years . 
how awful! how do you feel about it?
very angry and frustrated that she would behave that way .  it makes me think less of her as a person . 
yes i understand _comma_  it is really sad when you find that people you have known a long time can be very different from what you thought . 
i was sucker punched when i was    .  the guy broke his hand and fled the scene .  i saw him one time after this riding a bicycle but didn t do anything . 
lols why didn t you do anything 
i wasn t confident .  now i regret not punishing him .  
awww but it s still good that you didn t push him _comma_  cox it might lead to something else 
i recently completed my masters degree in education at almost    years old .  i feel really pleased with myself . 
oh my goodness! how wonderful!!!! that is so awesome! congratulations .  
thanks! it was a huge challenge _comma_  and i m so glad to have it behind me! 
wow! i better! i stopped at associates of general studies _comma_  because i wanted to be a mom more .  so that is a huge step for you! 
being a mom is great _comma_  too! and you never know  maybe you ll go back to school in the future! thanks! 
this is true! i am glad to be at home with these guys right now .  have a great day! 
i feel happy about the new house i have and that i can work from home .  thanks be to god
congratulations! i hope to get a house next year
it took me   months of determination and sacrifice .  but worth it . 
i bet! hard work pays off
i blamed myself for her fall because i wasn t close enough to prevent it .  i took care of her for months afterwards . 
things happen that are bad _comma_  i am sure it wasnt your fault . 
i was distracted by the sound of running water . 
i am sure they forgave you in the end . 
i can t get enough of music today .  especially all my songs bands from when i was in my twenties . 
music always seems to be better from the past _comma_  i understand all too well . 
its true though _comma_  they can t make good music these days .  not in any genre . 
i totally agree _comma_  new music is not as good . 
i get paid today and i m getting this new game i ve been waiting on to be released!
i get paid today as well! what game are you thinking about getting?
i m thinking about getting farcry   .  i pre order for the early release! i m really excited about it . 
didn t that game come out a few months ago? i got it shortly after i released and i wasn t very impressed .  it wasn t a bad game _comma_  but it certainly was not the best game . 
hi _comma_  i joined a firm   months ago and then i got a promotion for junior manager
congratulations .  that sounds like the fast track . 
yes _comma_  they thought that i have some extraordinary talent and that is the reason i got that position
cool .  maybe next year you will be a partner!
maybe yes  _comma_   haha  _comma_   now i am looking for a manager post and then become a senior manager
i hope you get it
hi _comma_  i have applied for a driving license thrice and i have failed in all the thee
i am so sorry to hear that! is there a particular section you are having trouble with?
yes _comma_  i am a little uncomfortable driving backwards .  i just can t do that . 
ah! that s quite understandable .  it is tricky at first and non intuitive .  i practiced driving in reverse with cones in an abandoned lot .  
every time i try not to hit that cone but those are so close . 
i know it s hard _comma_  but practice makes perfect! keep trying and i am sure you will get it!
i still can t believe my life is where it s at _comma_  especially if you look at the past few years .  i would never believe you if you told me i would be here . 
why what is the matter?
well  _comma_   for many years i was an alcoholic  _comma_   working for near minimum wage in kitchens .  but that all changed when i was accepted to university!
hmmm! that is just annoying being an alcoholic .  i purely understand your situation as i have gone through it .  well! life goes on . 
it does .  i worked really hard to pass the acceptance tests _comma_  and i couldn t believe when i passed with flying colors!
that is great . congrats . 
yesterday _comma_  i was standing in a lift and a man next to me whispered in my ears that your zip is open .  
thats creepy honestly
it was just very creepy situation
yeah whispering in someones ear is weird
lol thats funny
my hubby lost his job a couple of months ago but he has an interview this friday so i pray he will get that job
nice! what job is going for
armed security
cool .   hope he gets it _comma_  i hear they pay pretty well
i stayed alone at night in a office due to excessive work and was much scared . 
just you .  no security?
no _comma_  i was on a   th floor and security was down .  i was scared even with a single noise . 
i would be too .  
i have been awarded with a degree in marketing . 
that s nice _comma_  how long did it take you ?
it took   years but at last got it
fantastic _comma_  now do you have a job lined up?
yeah _comma_   i have  a job that i was looking for and now i am really enjoying my life . 
hey _comma_  have you ever been in a car wreck?
i ve been in a fender bender not a total wreck . 
i was in one about   years ago .  no one was hurt _comma_  but it totaled both of our cars . 
man _comma_  how was your insurance policy for that?
have you everr been in a fist fight with anyone?
yes _comma_  several times in my life .  mostly me and my older brother when we were younger . 
i got in a fist fight with my step father once .  it wasn t a fun experience as you can imagine . 
what started the fist fight in the first place?
have you ever played and old video game called everquest?
i haven t heard of it
it came out in      .  i used to play it when i was a teen .  i installed it the other day and had a good time playing . 
everything old makes a come back!
have you ever eaten at hardee s?
one of my favorite places to eat .  i love the swirled ice cream cones . 
i like it too  _comma_   but i m not a big fan of their new sliders .  they re so tiny  _comma_   and just one of them cost almost   dollars!
over priced food is no fun .  i like dollar menus . 
have you ever had a sleep paralysis dream?
yep! not really that fun to have since you see things at times . 
yeah _comma_  in mine i saw a smoke looking shadow over me with red eyes staring at me .  i ve never been more scared in my life . 
man that is scary! granted i like to hear things about that .  
have you ever rode on a roller coaster?
yes when i was young i did all the time _comma_  but i think after i turned    i got this weird fear of being so high up in the air .  what about you?
i hate riding them _comma_  but i used to machine components for their drive chain when i was a machinist . 
wow thats really cool! you must be happy to know about that stuff its interesting!
a while back my friend s boyfriend tried to get me to have an intimate relationship with him .  he knew i had been married a very long time  _comma_   as well as he was in a relationship with my friend .  i turned him down flat  _comma_   as i love my husband very much . 
what a creep .  i hope that you told on him . 
yes _comma_  i let him know that was wrong and disgusting .  i couldn t believe he did it!
some people are like that .  did you tell your husband?
yes  _comma_   as i am honest with him .  but  _comma_   i didn t want trouble . 
i m going overseas and i think i packed everything i need! 
where are you headed ?
going to kazakhstan .  that s where i was born .  my parents still live there and i miss them so much
great _comma_  i hope you have a nice trip .  how long will you be staying?
hi  _comma_   my girlfriend was recently let go of her job  _comma_   but she put so much work in to finding a new job and got one with better pay!
that s great! it was meant to happen then
yes i agree _comma_  she was so happy when she found out the job was hers
i would have been too .  i ve never been fired .  i always quit
she wasn t really fired _comma_  her position was no more .  schools don t have much room left for home ec teachers .  sad
i remember taking home ec .  i loved that class
yeah she has a passion for teaching .  these kids will be great to work with . 
so about a year ago now _comma_  my girlfriend decided to surprise me with a puppy!
oh wow _comma_  puppies are nice .   what kind of puppy did you get?
yes _comma_  so nice!! it was the best thing that could ve happened! it s a german shepherd! 
thats a nice breed of dog .   i just went on a camping trip with a relative who has one _comma_  they are very loyal and smart of course .   was he she your first pet?
there was this one time i was fairly drunk at a bar and this attractive girl was trying to make moves on me _comma_  but i did my best to ignore it all .  having a girlfriend and all . 
that s good! you should be proud of yourself
i was very proud definitely when i woke up the next morning and knew no mistakes were made!
that s great! i hate when people cheat
there was this one time my girlfriend and i had plans to meet a longhorn steakhouse for a date .  she ended up keeping me waiting inside    extra minutes! i was pretty frustrated . 
i can only imagine having to wait at the table alone   _comma_    wondering if she d show up .  at least   _comma_    it sounds like   _comma_    she finally arrived .   did she specify a reason for being so late?
yes _comma_  she actually had a legit reason so i couldn t be too mad at her .  she definitely made it up to me!
that s good .  i can somewhat relate .  i think the longest i ve waited on someone was a colleague who was supposed to meet us at happy hour  _comma_   and ended up getting delayed by our boss for    minutes .  we were glad she made it out  _comma_   but i did feel worse for her than for all of us . 
i m just so happy it s finally friday!
ahhh! me too _comma_  there is so much that can be done on the weekends!
i just want to sleep in and then watch movies all day long .  but i m a mom so i don t sleep in .  ever
i understand that! i have a bunch of pet snakes that wake me up thru the night!
i had to cancel a trip to see my brother after it started snowing heavily . 
actually that has happened to me _comma_  during thanksgiving
yes  _comma_   when the snow builds up on the road i get nervous  _comma_   and during this trip i couldn t even see where the road was and where the ditch began . 
im from nc mountains _comma_  it can be tricking driving when the snow is latying fast
it sure can .   when i decided that i wasn t comfortable driving in such deep snow i literally turned around and went home . 
that is a smart idea .  sometimes i would have no choice  _comma_   but to keep going  _comma_   bacsue of having to drive to work . no matter what the weather is . 
when my parents got divorced when i was a kid _comma_  it was one of the hardest things for me . 
i understand your pain .  my parents are also separated . 
it does definitely get easier over time i suppose .  now that i see my life i guess it was for the best . 
it just makes you mature faster .  just look at it like blessing in disguise . 
just the other day my girlfriend and i were getting ready for the beach _comma_  but right before we left it started to pour rain . 
that sucks .    did you end up coming up with an alternate plan?
well _comma_  when looking outside you could see a clear patch in the distance .  so we kinda just hoped for the best to wait it out .  we finally did get to go!
that s good to hear .   how was the beach?
there was one day after work that my girlfriend was planning a surprise party with a bunch of friends and family . 
that would take away from her time with you .  was it for you?
yes _comma_  the party was for me! i was so shocked and had no clue it was coming . 
that would be a really nice surprise then!
there was this one time i stole a shirt from my friend _comma_  and i feel pretty guilty about it . 
why d you steal it 
because i really liked it _comma_  and didn t think he d care . 
oh yea what kind of shirt was it 
my girlfriend recently went on a business trip for a week _comma_  i was very lonely during this experience . 
what did you do to pass the time?
i mainly just played video games and watched tv . 
i love video games . 
i moved to a new apartment and they didn t accept my dog breed _comma_  so i had to give her up .  :(
that sucks _comma_  why didn t you find a new apartment?
because here in my area in florida _comma_  there isn t too many options for me . 
maybe you should leave florida . 
my mom doesn t have a ton of money _comma_  but last christmas she made sure to get me some awesome things!
oh thats nice _comma_  what was she able to get for you?
she got me a brand new laptop i had been wanting for gaming!
thats awesome of her to be able to get you something you really wanted
i went on this ride at the beach called the slingshot .  it shoots you super high up in the air .  it was so teriffying _comma_  i had so much faith in the ride i wouldn t die!
omg _comma_  i have seen one of those!
it was seriously so scary _comma_  i almost pooped myself!
i believe that!
there was this time i went to the bar with my girlfriend and once i came out of the restroom _comma_  i saw her talking to some guy!
what did you do?
well i get super jealous and angry of course .  but in the end it was just a work friend .  oops!
did she get mad at you?
my dog randomly got up on my couch last week _comma_  and just started peeing .  like what!?!?!??!?!
haha that sucks! did you take him her out to pee recently?
not since lunch _comma_  so it s actually been about   hours .  i hate living on the top floor!
what did you have for lunch?
i finally graduated college last year _comma_  it felt like it took so long!
that is amazing _comma_  good work . 
yes _comma_  i am so proud of myself for finally accomplishing it!
how long did it take you?
my girlfriend saw me kissing another girl _comma_  who was kissing me at the bar .  i was very drunk . 
oh wow .  did she break up with you?
no .  i realized the mistake i made and took action so it never would happen again . 
don t sweat it man .  there is plenty of fish in the sea anyways . 
there was this one time i was driving down the road _comma_  and this guy on a sports bike popped a wheelie .  it was so sick!
nice _comma_  i wish i could do a wheelie!
i know! i do too .  i think i need to learn to ride a sports bike first .  hehe oops!
yeah  _comma_   i tried skateboarding in my childhood but was too scared to break something  _comma_   lol . 
when i was younger _comma_  i came back to the house with my family to find our family pet dead . 
oh no _comma_  i m so sorry to hear that .  did you ever figure out what happened?
he was very old _comma_  so i guess we were all expecting it .  he lived a good life!
oh _comma_  well that s a somewhat happy ending i suppose . 
my dog chewed a hole in my carpet   weeks ago .  i was very disgusted to say the least!
haha i m sorry! my dog is chill now but he ate a hole in the wall when he was a puppy lol
oh dang  _comma_   i guess i can t complain too much then  _comma_   that s brutal!
yeah lol what breed is yours? mine is a golden so he loves eating stuff .  now it s thankfully just actual food . 
i have to go to confession at the church .  i was a little mean to my mom _comma_  sometimes its difficult to be always nice
yea  _comma_   i am like that  _comma_   too .  did you apologize?
well yes when i shouted and i inmeaditelly apologize but i feel really bad
it happens .  like you said _comma_  we can t all be perfect . 
we walked     _comma_      we ate ice cream     _comma_      we rode a bike     _comma_      we laughed a lot     _comma_      we enjoyed the outdoors     _comma_      we were exhausted
who did you do all those things with? sounds like a wonderful day!
i had time that i did not share with the children and that was something that was pending in my soul
they must have been really happy . 
sometimes one gives priority to work
the world is very beautiful
there are so many spectacular views on this planet
exactly .  look at the beautiful scenery around you .  nature at its very best .  i am surprised people don t notice
it s a shame that people are letting these marvels pass them by . 
people are getting busy everyday with other stuff and they forget to breathe fresh air .  leads to s stressful life
i can remember feeling so disillusioned when someone who i really admired as a visionary turned out to be a real jerk on a day to day basis . 
that can really make you lose your faith in wanting to trust people
well  _comma_   it definitely makes you a little more realistic when you may be tempted to put someone on a pedestal .  not really fair to them  or  to yourself  _comma_   is it?
no not really because we are all human and make mistakes . 
as a kid _comma_  i was so frightened any time there was a tornado warning .  not sure if it was the wizard of oz effect or what    i just remember being frozen with fear . 
oh  _comma_   wow! my son was terrified of tornadoes because of that darn movie  _comma_   and we don t really even get tornadoes where we live! did you ever live through a tornado?
that s the thing    no! i mean _comma_  there were some that were kind of close    but nothing like what so many folks have to deal with .  i just remember wanting a basement sooooo badly    not something that s common where i grew up!
aw  _comma_   poor little thing! how did you overcome this? or  _comma_   are you still afraid of them?
my mom said the best thing once when i was babysitting and a tornado warning went off and i didn t want my own fear to affect the little boy i was with    she was on the phone and just said  you have big plans for the future  _comma_   right? nothing is going to get in the way of that .   for some reason  _comma_   it worked a charm ; )
your mom sounds awesome!  wow _comma_  what a cool thing to say!  
i feel so bad when i think back to times that i got angry and yelled at my kids for no real good reason    just a combination of the day s events and feeling irritated _comma_  really . 
we get carried away with our emotions sometimes .  did you explain it to them?
yes! that i feel good about! making a point to use it as an opportunity to talk .  i ve definitely used it when it comes to the way others might act    emphasizing that it s not about  them  _comma_  it s really about the person and where they re at . 
i m glad you re not too prideful to admit your mistakes to your kids and used it as a teaching opportunity . 
i do look at that as a strength _comma_  in anyone .  being able to say  i m sorry  and  i made a mistake .  
i was so excited the first time we were going to make an overseas move! i looked so forward to what i knew would be a life changing adventure!
that is pretty awesome _comma_  i know if i ever got the chance it would change my life as well . 
i highly _comma_  highly recommend it .  not always easy    culture shock  is  a thing!    but such a great way to enhance one s perspective . 
i understand that _comma_  as long as i could understand the language i think i would be great anywhere . 
i would fear my gift 
tell me more about this
my partner gave me a an i phone it is very memorable and pleasure to me
if its an older iphone i would treasure it 
yes but its a valuable gift to me 
everyone values things differently
yeah but this gift is definitely different for me
i have such an amazing husband! he works so hard so i could stay home with our baby
what does he do for work?
he is an armed guard
oh wow _comma_  that is a dangerous job . 
i have a pretty bad vision so i m so scared to drive at night
have you had it tested ?
yes _comma_  i even have glasses but because of astigmatism i don t see good at night even when i have glasses on
so you have like tunnel vision where ?
it seems like today everyone in the grocery store was in such a rush .  hurrying around!
yeah _comma_  that can be annoying especially in walmart since so many people go there .  it stresses you out when you don t need it to . 
yes! they cut in front _comma_  and bump into you .  plus being rude while they do it 
yeah   _comma_    everyone just seems miserable   _comma_    so it kind of drags you down   _comma_    too .  but it s a necessary evil . 
i m so sleep deprived and my baby wanted to play in the middle of the night and i just yelled at him :( i feel so terrible
that is why i am scared to have kids _comma_  that sounds terrible
i love being a mother but sleep deprivation is so horrible
that seems to be the case _comma_  you win some you lose some i guess
i love being around them and it s great to see them each year . 
who would that be?
o i m sorry  _comma_   my niece and nephews  _comma_   only seem in the summer .  do you get company during the summer?
i love seeing mine too .  i know how happy that must make you feel .  mine are local . 
my kids are going into  th and  th grade in a couple weeks .  they really are growing up well
thats good to hear .   my kids will returning to school soon as well .   i cant wait!
my oldest daughter has some learning disabilities so i m really proud of how she is doing .  they re both growing up so fast
thats cool
i paid all my bills today _comma_  i feel so relived and good
every little accomplishment counts! what bills did you have to pay?
rent and electricity .  we ve been struggling financially so it s such a relieve to pay bills
sorry to hear that .  well _comma_  at least this will be a weight off your shoulders . 
i studied so hard for my bar exam so that i could become a lawyer .  i prepared for almost   months straight!
wow _comma_  you re so determined! did you pass your exam?
i did pass! it was a rough   months  _comma_   but once i got there  _comma_   i felt like i was ready . 
yay! congrats! that s really awesome .  you should be proud of yourself
i was about to book a flight for my baby and i and i was so surprised to find out i didn t need to pay for my baby sticket
that s really exciting! i would be so happy about that .  
i know! now i can spend the rest of the money on something cool 
that s what i would do too .  do you have something in mind? 
my husband called me a punk today for no reason .  and then when i told him he hurt my feelings he didn t even understand why 
forget him .  get yourself a real man . 
no .  i love him .  but he can be such a punk sometimes
if he really loved you _comma_  he would pay attention to your every need .  kick him to the curb . 
when i was younger  _comma_   i got my driver s license .  i was sooo scared to drive  _comma_   because i didn t want to get into an accident . 
be positive .  don t deviate your mind while driving .  concentrate completely on driving .  you can . 
i tried to tell myself that  _comma_   but my dad got into a really bad accident once  _comma_   and it has scared me ever since . 
sorry to hear this .  hope you ll get out from this fear and become a good driver .  
i recently started learning to propagate my tomato plants by planting clipped off branches .  
sounds cool . 
yea  _comma_   i put them in a glass of water for a week or two and they grow their own roots  _comma_   wasn t expecting much . 
do you cook a lot with tomatoes
i do yes! and since the method i used is working _comma_  i have tons of tomatoes!
good for you!
around town it seems like traffic has been horrible lately .  driving around town is just crazy . 
people just don t seem to pay attention when they are in a hurry . 
yes _comma_  exactly! they are always speeding or cutting you off .  and of course no blinker use!
that s the part that bothers me the most .  when they just cut in front of you with no warning . 
a few years ago  _comma_   i became friends with someone through an online video game .  eventually we trusted each other  _comma_   so we met up in person!
i know a lot of people in real life through that kind of stuff .  has been pretty great for me after    years .  how is it for you so far . 
i d say it s going pretty well _comma_  we eventually got married! how did you meet your friends?
well we met through going to conventions and i even visited some myself .  really great bunch of people and i see places . 
okay .  i care for everyone
well you sound like a good person
thanks _comma_  i hope i am .  you sound like one too
why thank you!
because you gave me a compliment _comma_  which i feel is a genuine one
i recently had a one night stand with a woman from my past .  it caught both of us off guard
oh wow .  that s crazy . 
yes _comma_  it was a very interesting time .  i wish to continue talking to her despite living in different locations
i m glad you made amends then and no drama . 
my wife was able to get a job with microsoft without going to a four year college!
that s pretty amazing .  she must be skillful regardless . 
she really is .  it just shows that you don t need to have a four year degree in order to be successful . 
yea _comma_  experience and skills matter a lot more . 
i walked my dog outside _comma_  and she still pooped in the house! ugh . 
i am familiar with that .   that is frustrating . 
yeah . even though i take her outside  _comma_      minutes later  _comma_   she ll poop or pee in the house .  why!?
i ask myself the same thing .   sometimes i think they get mad at something we do . 
i think being with my husband makes me a better person
that is good .  do you have strong feeling for each other?
definetly _comma_  he s my best friend forever . 
that is cute
i really don t like when things happen when noone is home . 
things? like what kind of things?
like stuff falling off shelfes because a dog runs into them! hah _comma_  crazy i know . 
i know what you mean! i m literally doing the same thing right now  _comma_   babysitting my neighbor s dogs in her big two story house  _comma_   all alone .  makes me feel like someone s watching me . 
i really love my life right now . 
thats really good to hear .   whats going on?
nothing really! i just love that i can work at home and have time to clean or cook whenever i want . 
i work from home too .   its so nice to be able to do laundry and things on my breaks .   im so productive around the house
right? and no having to interact with others unless we choose too . 
and i can stay in my pjs all day long!
so i just got home and all of my friends were there for a birthday party i have no clue! can you imagine my reaction?
yeah  _comma_   of course i can! that sounds heartless .  maybe that shows you who your friends truly are  _comma_   and you should maybe look elsewhere .  could be a wake up call . 
well the party was for me _comma_  hahaha they really got me on that one!
oh  _comma_   i misunderstood! i thought you meant you weren t invited to one that you later found out about .  hah! then i guess the wake up call is you have really good friends! so  _comma_   you like surprise parties then? i never did . 
its not fun being reminded of things you ve forgotten . 
what kinds of things are you talking about?
owed money to my mother in law for something  _comma_        _comma_   she reminded me in a less then nice way . 
that s not very fair _comma_  a kind reminder could ve gone a long way . 
exactly _comma_  especially since she owes me a lot more of something being paid over time . 
i went to san antonio the other day _comma_  was great to see that city . 
i have been there many times . 
o really? what s your favorite thing there?
i love going to the spurs games . 
i just got back from my graduation! can you imagine after   years i graduated with the highest score of my college in the past    years! 
wow that is a long time ago . 
yes! i studied so hard _comma_  can you imagine how i feel? i cannot believe it!
yes _comma_  where did you go to college?
i hate the sight of someone throwing up .  my nephew did that the other and day and man . 
that is so disgusting .   i hate seeing that!
yea  _comma_   he had eaten to much sugar and well  _comma_   it didn t end well
sugar will do that to kids every time .   just don t let them on a  roller coaster to make it even worse . 
i came home from work and step barefoot on one of my sons legos _comma_  i was so pissed!
that sounds really painful!  you should pick them up . 
yes _comma_  i was so mad i always tell them to pick the toys up . 
they must not listen very well . 
my mother in law got to eat qdoba today _comma_  one of my favorite places i haven t had in awhile
qdoba is the bomb! although _comma_  i think i prefer chipotle slightly more . 
no way .  queso all the way! they don t have one near by but she was traveling and the airport up north did . 
yeah   _comma_    but chipotle has queso now! but   _comma_    yeah   _comma_    it isn t as good as qdoba queso .  
yesterday i watch on tv a kid who could speak   different languages at age   _comma_  i was in shook!
wow! how is that even possible?
well they are called wonder kids! i was in wonder _comma_  i also read about one who just graduated from college at age   
i wonder if they ever feel like they don t get a childhood?
my husband is quite impressive to me . 
sounds like you are lucky . 
yea _comma_  he s become the best manager in his market in just   years . 
that is great!
this afternoon i went to my sons soccer game and he scored three goals! happiest dad ever!
i figure your son is pretty happy as well . 
yes! i love him so dad  _comma_   but i feel like my own achievement since i teach him how to play  _comma_   he dedicated the three goals to me!
couldn t ask for a better day
i was doing a presentation for work  _comma_   and tried to tell a story about something kind of related to break the ice .   no one laughed or even really cracked a smile  _comma_   so it put me off for the rest of the presentation . 
that is no fun _comma_  you always hope that first one hits so they are more receptive the rest of the time
yeah  _comma_   and i really thought it was a decent story .   nothing ground breaking  _comma_   but at least should have gotten a chuckle . 
well there is always next time!
my wife went to germany to attend a language course at the end of june .   i ve been mostly spending time with my dogs while she s been gone since we recently moved and i don t really know anyone outside of work . 
you should take the dogs to a dog park after work and meet people!
that s a good idea .   i don t know where there s a dog park near me _comma_  i should look into that . 
definitely .  i think even waze app will tell you in you search  around me  .  
something i did not expect from a neighbor _comma_  this morning he gave me some beautiful flowers
wow  _comma_   that is sweet of him  _comma_   does he have a crush on you?
it was a nice gesture on his part .  but i do not know
huh _comma_  well maybe he is starting his campaign lol
but beyond that .  small gestures make others  lives happier
my neighbor has a really annoying little dog that she always brings outside when she s smoking .   it barks constantly at everything and she doesn t try to keep it quiet . 
what type of dog is it?
a pomeranian .   i don t have anything against that type of dog specifically _comma_  but this one is just terrible . 
i get that _comma_  some are just not well trained at all
this morning my husband received a call  _comma_   he got nervous  _comma_   i think it was a woman  .  difficult
oh? that s not good .  do you think he has lots of secrets?
i think so  .  i m a little worried _comma_  because of the situation
i m sorry :( i do hope things can be worked out
thank you for your solidarity
i have a great picture from my wedding where my friends and i are in a circle having a shot _comma_  makes me want to go hang out with them again . 
i assume you don t get to see them often?
yeah _comma_  we moved away a few months after the wedding for my wife to go to graduate school . 
that s too bad .  i bet you miss them . 
yesterday  _comma_   a difficult day  _comma_   the anniversary of the death of my mother
sorry to hear about the bad news . 
thank you for your solidarity
how long ago did she die?
seven years  .  i miss her
i went for an interview for a job i really wanted and ended up waiting a long time before i heard anything .   i managed to keep my spirits up for a good long while . 
i hope you got it . 
i did actually!  it s a good job _comma_  especially since the market where i am isn t great for my field . 
congrats! you deserve it for keeping your faith!
my daughter is angry with me  _comma_   she says she does not need me  _comma_   because i scolded her
how old is she?
she is   years old but she is a very focused girl
well  _comma_   you know she ll get over it  _comma_   but it does hurt . 
that s right  .  but i think i ve surpassed
hello _comma_  tomorrow i have the cooking test and i feel safe .  i am sure that i will approve with an excellent rating
oh _comma_  how nice .  what are your plans in that regard for the future?
have my own restaurant
what a dream come true for you that ll be . 
with work _comma_  effort and clarity in the goal  .  i will surely arrive
i m so happy i made enough money yesterday to pay my bills!
oh man _comma_  bills .  that s awesome!
yes _comma_  such a relieve!
does anyone help you with the bills?
sometimes we have angels  _comma_   called friends  _comma_   i m happy because god sent me mine
awh thats so sweet how long have you two known one another? 
we are    years old  _comma_   but we have had difficult moments  _comma_   but we have overcome it
sounds like a great friendship! 
that s right  .  i m happy
my son behaved badly with his friend  _comma_   i treat him badly  _comma_   i had to punish him
oh no .  how old is he?
he is    years old _comma_  but he must understand that friendship is something sacred
friendship is special .  did he do something to his friend?
he hit him and said a bad word
when my brother got out of college he had a job and a car and was doing so fucking great for himself .  everything was lined up and he was ready to take off in the world .  the moment i graduated college i have nothing that i can do .  i took the same degree but that   year gap has led me to have nothing compared to him .  it was so fucking annoying 
man _comma_  that s gotta be a horrible feeling .  i think it would help if you try not to compare yourself to others . 
i do my best but sometimes that s super hard .  i guess that s just one of those things everyone got to deal with .  
i hope things turn out better for you .  keep fighting . 
you too _comma_  thank you! 
i went to a job interview a few days ago _comma_  and i feel like i totally rocked it!
oh man _comma_  that s awesome .  i hope you get it!
thanks a bunch! it pays much better than my current job  _comma_   so i really hope i do  _comma_   but i think i got it in the bag . 
glad you rocked that interview .  sounds like it s gonna be a sweet gig . 
i went through some of my old stuff yesterday _comma_  and i found my security blanket that i used when i was a kid!
awww i bet that brought back memories . 
it really did .  it kinda made me sad _comma_  because it was all tattered and dirty .  i ended up washing it . 
what will you do with it now?
you know _comma_  i see all the back to school shopping and i think parents have their priorities mixed up . 
how so?
parents are more worried about appearances than learning .  it s about school supplies not new jordans or under armor .  
that s pretty much teaching their kids to worry about appearances than learning _comma_  too .  that s too bad . 
i found a poor stray kitten on the side of the road _comma_  and i nursed him back to full health .  poor thing . 
did you name it?
i did! his name is alphy . 
that s cute .  i bet he s happy . 
it s hard as a parent _comma_  when your kids are teenagers and have to handle their own problems
you kinda want to hold their hand _comma_  but you know it s best they solve some problems on their own .  you can t be with them all the time . 
i know _comma_  they mommy in me wants to just jump in and fix it all like i used to
it is truely for the best .  try not to worry . 
my wife called me this morning and told me she scored a new job with microsoft! 
that s amazing! she must be excited . 
she is so excited .  she s even making more than i am . 
must be nice to have more income coming into the family . 
i felt bad my dogs ears have been bothering him .  we had to finally take him to the vet yesterday . 
is he going to be okay?
yeah _comma_  it was ear mites and he got medicine for it .  you can tell he isn t feeling good from side effects so i ve been babying him . 
well i bet he appreciates that .  we all want to be babied sometimes . 
i bought a chocolate bar for my wife at the store  _comma_   and i was going to give it to her  _comma_   but i ended up eating it . i feel bad . 
lol .  did you tell her? you can just buy another one . 
lol i didn t tell her . should i?
just buy another one and don t eat it .  lol
don t you hate it when you get in trouble for something you didn t do? my boss got mad at me for someone else s mistake . 
that s sucks .  does the culprit know?
yeah _comma_  that s the worst part .  they warned me that i was going to get yelled at because of something they did . 
that is unacceptable .  what are you going to do?
i m taking a vacation and going on a cruise to alaska next week!
that sounds so fun! 
i ve never been _comma_  so it s going to be an amazing experience .  i m a little nervous that i ll get seasick . 
take some medication with you just in case . 
hello  _comma_   i think i will not forget the beauty of her hair  _comma_   the sweetness of her lips and the clarity of her eyes
so . what happened to her
she died  .  my mother
in real life? or are you making this up
it is true . 
hello _comma_  i never imagined the violence that can unleash a dog attacking a bird  .  i was impressed
i ve never imagined something like that before .  where did you see this?
in a big dog  .  in the park
that s nuts .  did the owner do anything?
i did not have the strength to control it
my poor neighboor is suffeing a lot without her husband
i suffer a lot too when my wife is gone .  what happened to him?
he passed away from cancer . 
ah _comma_  the evil cancer .  took my grandmother as well .  i am sure he s off in a better place now . 
i enjoyed my day the other day _comma_  found out something good! newphew may come to live with us for ayear . 
nice! how old is your nephew?
   _comma_  he wants to see us for more then   weeks a year . 
that s good .  gotta build and maintain those family bonds .  i should be doing the same once my nephew gets older . 
i lost something of my mother in laws the other day _comma_  i feel so bad . 
that sucks .  can you make it up to her somehow?
i ll have to buy her another piece of tupperwear _comma_  it seems silly but it s expensive stuff!
at least those things come in sets _comma_  so you can keep part of it?
i may do that!
i was waiting to see if i was going to receive an award
it is a work award or something?
its an award due to achieving my work i have worked hard for
i am sure you are going to get it . 
i appreciate that .  thank you
wow! congrats on your new job! i can understand why you are apprehensive _comma_  but it sounds like a good opportunity . 
why thank you!
no problem! everything will work out in the end .  no need to worry . 
thanks for being so understanding!  i feel a little better now . 
i felt sooooo nervous going to my last job interview! nerves must occur in proportion to how badly you  want  something!
i know what you mean .  did you get the job?
i did! the company does something that i actually like    a panel interview vs a series of one on ones .  have you ever had an interview like that?
i have not .  what is it?
it just means you re in a room with several representatives from different parts of the company .  to me _comma_  that helps it feel more like a conversation    and it s more time efficient too!
i know i m not a perfect parent but some just aren t good at it or don t care . 
there are some bad parents out there _comma_  that s for sure .  is it hard to be a parent?
it is when it comes to all the unexpected stuff .  went to the mall today and lady was letting her toddler run all over the mall smelling like a dirty litter box .  it smelled horrible . 
lol _comma_  that is terrible .  she should have changed his diaper before leaving the house what the heck . 
i always feel like no one hears me .  like when i speak it falls on deaf ears . 
that sucks .  maybe it s time to get new friends?
well  _comma_   for the most part it s my family .  my husband  _comma_   kids and pets .  i know they re not deaf and it s frustrating!
don t worry _comma_  it will get better .  i know you deserve better
my daughter is a teenager now so we don t spend as much time together as we used to . 
i know exactly what you mean .  my sister is entering her teenage years .  i feel like it s all i can do to just not be annoying to her _comma_  so i can t even imagine what it s like for a mom . 
yeah _comma_  luckily we had a fun girls evening out today .  we went out to eat and did a bunch of shopping . 
that s good! all it takes is a good day once in a while to keep things on track until they get older .  my mom just tries to be as patient and considerate with my sister so that she still feels motivated to communicate with her . 
i m really looking forward to this trip i have planned next week . 
where are you going?
i m going to visit the national parks in california .  well the ones not on fire . 
i ve never been to california . 
i was bathing my dog in the backyard this weekend _comma_  and she got loose .  she then went and rolled in the dirt getting extra filthy . 
that must of been terrible . 
it was .  since she was wet _comma_  the dirt got stuck inside her fur .  she was even harder to clean the second time around . 
did anyone help you?
been having a good day _comma_  relaxing on my couch watching netflix .  i got a nice cup of hot chocolate and my cat curled up in my lap . 
you re making me want to do the same thing .  that sounds great!
yeah _comma_  it s been a great day .  thinking about moving to the bed and going to sleep next . 
nothing like relaxing and getting your body ready for a night of good sleep!
i had a job interview yesterday .  i was really nervous before it started .

well habe fun i guess . 
it was bad and ontop of it they refused to admit their mistake
oh no _comma_  what happened?
placed an order online and the appliance place didnt have it _comma_  so they gave me something else without telling me
oh _comma_  that s odd! i m sorry they didn t tell you what was going on .  
thanks for hearing me out .  i filed a complaint at the council .  i hope they listen
no problem! i hope so too .  good luck with that!
i really was distraught
really?
yes .  makes me value human human interaction a lot more .  i had to go to the grocery store to feel ok
ok
it made me proud he was my rep
who was your rep?
the president represented us at this association
aha .  what was the association?
international ceramic trading
it has been very quiet in here since she went on vacation .  no one to talk to . 
did you got bored?
i kept myself occupied with movies and video games .  but it wasn t the same as having real company . 
i understand . 
i can t wait to travel south to get my favorite take out .  can t find it here . 
that is a very long drive! how long will it take to get there?
about an hour .  but it ll be worth it . 
it must be very good _comma_  if you re willing to go that far!
i m quite happy with where i live .  i have   swimming pools to use anytime i want and also a gym . 
wow _comma_  you re very lucky .  do you share the facilities with other people?
yes but there s hardly anyone else who uses them because they only come for   weeks out of the year for a vacation .  i m here permanently . 
which part of the country are you in? are you by the beach?
i have never been so shocked than when my husband threw me a birthday party without me knowing . 
was it fun?
it was so much fun .  i thought is was going to be another normal day .  wake up  _comma_   go to work  _comma_   etc .  but i was wrong about that!
was it recently? happy birthday
yes _comma_  last week .  thank you!
it was a long   weeks but i m so happy it s over and she s back now
oh goodness _comma_  what happened for the past   weeks?
she went to visit her family
oh _comma_  i was thinking something bad happened . 
it was a very hard experience in my soul to lose my mother
sorry to hear this! i can understand your pain .  
thank you for your solidarity
take care of yourself and your family . 
thanks
we knew she was pregnant _comma_  but didn t know the gender yet .  imagine my shock when i saw the ultrasound for the gender!
i am sure it will be fine _comma_  do you have a preference
well it s a boy .  which is what i have been wanting since we met
i am happy for you then
even though there are plenty of flirts around _comma_  i remain loyal to my wife . 
that is good _comma_  it is very important to be loyal in a healthy relationship!
it is the most important thing to me .  i have told her since day one _comma_  which was   years ago now . 
good for you! i wish more people were like this _comma_  unlike my ex! 
my friend got a new truck _comma_  i m really envious of him . 
you should channel that envy into motivation!
i agree _comma_  if i work hard i could buy that truck .  
exactly _comma_  be positive and you can buy one for yourself!
i should _comma_  i just need the drive to get out there and do it .  i need to stop wasting money . 
hello _comma_  i feel that today is going to be a wonderful day  .  i will enjoy it
that is a great attitude to have!  it is great to have an optimistic approach to life . 
if i really like to be positive _comma_  despite the difficulties
i feel the same way .   we are a glass half full kind of people!
so it is  .  a big hug
i have been looking after my wife this week .  she has the flu
oh poor thing _comma_  is she at least getting better?
it seems so .  sleeping all day today lol
haha that must be nice too though _comma_  you get your own alone time for the most part!
this morning and i saw a tree  _comma_   i never detailed it  _comma_   but this time i saw it beautiful  .  i realized god exists
i see _comma_  you must have felt hopeful
i gave thanks in spite of the difficulties
good _comma_  one should always be positive
thank you for your comments
today i realized that my daughter sings wonderful _comma_  i enjoy it a lot  .  i was impressed
thats adorable how old is she? 
she is   years old  .  she is a nice girl
she sounds like it 
that s right  .  thanks for your comment
hi  _comma_   i feel bad because i ve realized that i do not love my husband  _comma_   but i do not have the courage to tell him
that s a pretty heavy realization . better tell him now that regret it later
you re right
best of luck to you
thanks
i m looking for a new job _comma_  and i m feeling pretty good about my options . 
what are your options? 
there s a lot of openings for tech jobs lately _comma_  especially technical support . 
oh yeah thats always going to be up and coming for sure 
my wife just went out of town for school for   months .   i don t really know anyone here _comma_  so i don t know what i m going to do while she s gone . 
it is an excellent opportunity   _comma_    to know other people and places   _comma_    to open up to the possibility   _comma_    i assure you that it will go to you very well
i m sure it is great for her _comma_  but it makes me feel a little unsure of what to do with myself . 
you do the same thing  .  the opportunity is for both
hello  _comma_   i made a serious mistake .  i made a comment without bad intentions of the elders .  i related them to the dinosaurs  _comma_   and my father heard it  .  he looked me in the eyes  .  and he told me that you too could be one of them  .  i felt bad
that sounds like it s rough _comma_  did your father accept your apology?
yes _comma_  but i feel like a cockroach
well   _comma_    i m sure he understands   _comma_    and you shouldn t feel too bad   _comma_    as long as you apologized you re fine . 
thanks
i m supposed to be on a diet _comma_  but i couldn t help myself and i ate three chocolate bars . 
it happens we have to reward ourselves sometimes .  dark chocolate is actually good for you! 
but i m supposed to be on a diet! i can t lose weight if i have no self control :(
hey it was just one day! you got this .  work extra hard for the next   days! 
my husband lost his job a couple of months ago and yesterday he finally got a new job!!
that s awesome
he is such a hard working man! he works so much so i could stay home with our baby
i m sure your supportiveness inspires him to work as hard as he does
i was trying to take a nap the other day and my neighbor wouldn t shut her tiny barky dog up . 
i totally feel you on that .  i swear my neighbors have to be the loudest at night slamming their car doors and yelling outside right in front of my bedroom window .  
ugh _comma_  that s the worst .   thankfully we re on the second floor so we don t have to deal with car noise too much . 
my bedroom is first floor _comma_  and literally maybe   feet from the parking lot .  lucky me .  lucky you tho too with animals .  lol 
i lost my favorite hoodie somewhere .  i m so upset .  like how could i lose a hoodie? it s so big _comma_  did i just leave it somewhere?
did you retrace your steps
i ve been to so many places on that day it would be really hard to do it
i used to lose stuff all the time .   then i learned to relax and actively imagine all the places i d been to .   it worked for me then _comma_  found a g shock watch a pair of nikes and my wallet
i m going to see my parents in   weeks!! i didn t see them since     ! i m so excited
that s great! i bet they are equally excited if not more :) are you travelling alone?
no  _comma_   with my little baby .  they ve never met my son  _comma_   they can t wait
oh i bet! you guys will have such a wonderful time together
my wife had been out of the country for   months for school .   i left early to get to the airport to get her when she came back because i was excited to see her . 
i would be too _comma_  that is a long time!
yeah _comma_  it s especially long since we only recently moved and i don t really know anyone outside of work . 
wow that would make for a lonely timeframe
i wish my neighbors were more considerate .  they woke me up at  am recently . 
wow did youcall someone about that?
no point .  their smoke alarm went off and management don t care anyway . 
wow  _comma_   that sucks  _comma_   that is why i wanna live all alone!
me too! i really don t appreciate their lack of manners   it s as if they own the whole complex!
my friend came over yea sterday and we were sitting on the couch chit chatting and when i got up i accidentally farted .  so embarrasing
oh my _comma_  did they notice you farted?
she did _comma_  she didn t say anything but i know she heard it
must have rather awkward .  remember _comma_  farting is just natural and i am sure she understands that . 
my girlfriend went on a week trip with her friends _comma_  and left me alone to fend for myself . 
i am sorry _comma_  how have you been passing the time
mostly been playing video games _comma_  but it s so boring without her . 
i love video games _comma_  you should buy a switch!
hello  .  i give thanks for the good things and the things that do not _comma_  the good things make me feel good and the satisfaction and the bad things are internal growth
that is a very optimistic way to look at life  .  i should actually look at life that way too instead of getting overwhelmed when things do not go my way
for me it was a hard learning  .  but after many blows  .  i assimilated it
how long have you looked at life this way? is it sustainable ?
for a year  .  you assimilate it when you realize that you are responsible  .  neither the people nor the circumstances are responsible
this is completely true .  it involves totally re conditioning the mind  . 
condition the mind and spirit
i would totally attempt it 
i lost my mother to breast cancer several years ago and i am still grieving the loss . 
i am so very sorry .  have you had time to talk about it
yes _comma_  i talk about it but it really does not help much .  i pray a lot and that gives me some comfort 
that s good prayer can comfort _comma_  maybe you should talk to your pastor
i dont have a pastor _comma_  or a church i can go to .  i meditate and i pray and i watch preachers on sunday morning tv .  all of those do help some .  
i had plans to move from florida to california _comma_  but i m starting to get cold feet . 
ooh  _comma_   that s a big jump .  i was considering the same thing  _comma_   but i  one state above :)
ohh! did you change your mind? i m trying to convince myself that it s going to be better for me to make the move . 
i put it on hold until i fly up there this year to check things out .  it s quite a big decision _comma_  and i would recommend going there for a while just to see what it s like
today i think today is a day to learn   _comma_    to hug   _comma_    to smile   _comma_    to make someone happy
yes _comma_  realistically i wish it were possible to do that everyday but general stresses of life get in the way 
that s right  .  but i dedicate an hour to do that  _comma_   to my children i kiss them  _comma_   my neighbor smiled at him and from life i try to learn something
maybe thats a good idea _comma_  to try and set aside a small amount of time a day to do it instead of trying to do it all the time along with everything else going on .  good idea!
it makes me feel good that my reflection serves you  .  i send you a smile
i m so lonely .  i mean .  i have no friends  _comma_   no husband  _comma_   no kids .  i wish i had at least somebody in my life
do you have any hobbies that may help you to meet people?
not really .  i love playing video games and watch tv .  i m socially awkward
same here .   try to take advantage of your gaming and be more outgoing during gametime . 
my wife has been out of the country for almost   months .   i can t wait to go pick her up at the airport!
you must be ver
i m assuming you got cut off somehow :p  i m very happy she s coming back . 
 very excited .   (oops) .   where did she go?
germany for a language immersion course . 
i am so thrilled to be able to go on a short but long overdue vacation
where are you going
a short weekend trip to the ozarks for a float trip on spring fed white water .  
that sounds like fun _comma_  where in the ozakrs?
down close to the border line of arkansas and the ozarks .  it is around the current river 
i was planning my wedding and trying to get a caterer .   the one we were looking at was completely ignoring every time my wife tried to communicate with them _comma_  to the point where i told them off and went with someone else . 
sounds like you made the right decision .   what a bunch of a holes
yeah   _comma_    it was weird   _comma_    the caterer was a woman so i can t imagine it was like a sexism thing   _comma_    but she responded to me almost instantly every time . 
hm maybe she liked you ha
i got a free pizza from domino s but felt bad about how it happened . 
free pizza is good! how did you get it?
the pizza took forever to get delivered so i asked if it was free .   the delivery girl  _comma_   who was brand new  _comma_   didn t know so she just didn t charge me . 
that is awesome!
well _comma_  i like free pizza for sure .  but i still felt a bit concerned that they might take the cost of it out of her paycheck . 
how was your day?
it was fine how about you?
yeah good .  whats your name?
i m not sure i feel comfortable telling you as we just met . 
oh its fine nice to chat with you unknown friend
hello how was your day?
my day was great so far!  how about you?
yeah fine great day
that is good to hear!  i m am sure you are grateful to experience such a good day!
yeah nice to talk to you . 
i wore wrong pair of socks to the college .  but   _comma_    no was there to spot it .  but   _comma_    when we have to go in for a church we have to first remove the shoes .  at   _comma_    that time friend of mine spotted with with wrong pair of shoes .  they made a fun of me .  that was very awkward situation . 
oh that sucks :( maybe organize the socks better?
my room was messy as there was a party last night in my house and friends were enjoying in whole house .  that is the reason . 
ah .  well _comma_  chalk it up to one of those funny but awkward moments of life then!
ohh
i went for a job interview _comma_  and it seemed to go pretty well . 
that s great! when will you find out?
it should be a couple weeks _comma_  assuming they go at the pace they said they would . 
good luck! i hope you get it . 
i moved far away from my hometown for the first time so my wife could go to grad school .   it s hard to be away from my friends . 
i know how it feels to be homesick _comma_  but you have to put your wife first . 
yeah   _comma_    definitely   _comma_    that s why i went ahead with the move .   i m just not very good at meeting people   _comma_    so it can be tough . 
you and your wife should go out to events and try to meet new people . 
i took my wife to the airport for her trip out of the country for   months .   i felt really bad on the way home . 
ohh man _comma_  that is a long time to be alone .   what are you going to do while she is gone?
mostly work and hang out with the dogs .   we just moved recently and i don t really know anyone outside of work . 
i m sorry .   where did she go?
germany for a language course . 
i almost got in a fight in a drive thru lineup . 
what happened? did someone bump on your car?
no _comma_  the person cut in front of some other people .   i confronted him about it and we got into a shouting match . 
be carefull  _comma_  you don t know the cray people that is out there . 
yes _comma_  afterwards i regretted the confrontation .   i thought i could have easily been shot . 
i got on a stranger s boat by accident at the marina . 
that must have been awkward . 
fortunately the owner didn t see me before i got off _comma_  but i sure felt stupid about it . 
don t worry about it .  it happens to the best of us . 
indeed .   and next time i ll be sure to double check whose it is before i come aboard . 
i was looking at old pictures from my first  adult  apartment _comma_  and thinking about all the times i spent there with friends and roommates . 
nostalgia can be wonderful _comma_  can t it?
it can  _comma_   but it can also hurt sometimes .   it s probably just nostalgia hardcore  _comma_   but sometimes i wish i could go back to that time . 
i feel the same when listening to   s alternative music
last night was crazy .  i couldn t relax even though i really wanted to .  i was in a house full of people screaming and yelling . 
what was going on!?
my friend and her mom were fighting about money _comma_  and my friend s daughters were wanting attention . 
sounds like a lot of drama ugh i hope you get some rest tonight 
i hope so too .  i plan on going back to my place just to get away from all of this . 
i had a job interview today and i think it really well . 
that s really good you feel pretty secure about it then?
the interviewer told me that i was his favorite interview so far .  and i think my qualifications are a really good match for the company . 
oh wow then that is really good! for someone to say that! you should be very proud of yourself . 
i saw a picture of a dog on reddit that looked a lot like mine so i called out the person saying it was a picture of my dog _comma_  but it turned out i was wrong .   whoops . 
thar was an embarasing moment for sure
yeah  _comma_   i don t like calling people out in general  _comma_   don t know what made me think to do it this time . 
maybe you are felling lonely these days?
i m surprised the police are going to let they get away with it . 
did you have an enemy or someone as a suspect?
i think the mailman might be mad at me because i keep ordering heavy items . 
weird reaction .  i feel like he should just do his job and not key your car . 
my test results come back today .  i do hope everythings ok . 
what are you worrying about?
i had an abnormal ekg and they did a stress test on my heart to make sure everything s alright . 
well  _comma_   i hope it s alright  _comma_   heart problems is not something you should take lightly . 
absolutely! i m just over worrying because i ve always been so healthy .  just a little stressed out . 
i went back to my home where i grew up and a flood of good memories came bavk to me .  i had so many fun times with my best friends when i was a child .  
what is your favorite memory with your friends?
playing outside in the summer time .  many fun summer times .  swimming holes  _comma_   icecream  _comma_   catching fireflies . 
that sounds like so much fun! i m glad you got to go back to revisit . 
me too!
my parents gave me a car for graduating from college .  it makes my life so much easier . 
you deserved for graduating . 
thanks _comma_  now all i got to do is get a real career .  i couldn t have done it with out them . 
just keep working hard and make them proud . 
the more problems i have to deal with  _comma_   the more faith  _comma_   and faithful i become .  i am stronger in my faith when bad things happen in my life and around me . 
i m glad to hear you have something you can lean on in hard times .  i m personally an atheist but i can respect someone with faith . 
i was told once by a dear departed friend that  what ever floats a persons boat it good because it keeps people sane as long as no one is being hurt .  
i absolutely agree .  as long as you aren t hurting anyone _comma_  do whatever you please!
yeh to that
i had a job interview yesterday that i thought went really well _comma_  but it didn t .  they just emailed me back and told me that i didn t get the job . 
oh man  _comma_   i m sorry to hear that! it doesn t necessarily mean it went bad  _comma_   though .  maybe they just had a more qualified candidate?
i m just pretty embarrassed _comma_  i was so confident .  this whole job hunting adventure has been a complete nightmare . 
keep your head up! job hunting is usually stressful for most people .  you got this!
i can understand why you might be jealous of your coworker .  i would try to keep your head up . 
i m not jealous of my co worker though?  what makes you think i m jealous?
you said that you were envious of his promotion .  it is understandable though . 
i didn t say that . 
okay _comma_  i am glad to hear that you are no longer feeling jealous . 
i just got a puppy _comma_  but i have to leave him at home while i go to work .  i feel so bad . 
that would be sad _comma_  do you keep him in a cage?
fortunately   _comma_    no .  i let him run around the house   _comma_    but i feel like he gets bored   _comma_    so i keep the tv on for him . 
that s nice _comma_  what does he enjoy watching?
stealing is wrong .  i would also be ashamed of my actions . 
absolutely .  although the world isn t so black and white .  sometimes a person may have to steal to survive .  is it really wrong then?
if that is the case  _comma_   i can understand why they had to do it .  in circumstances where someone is stealing solely for unneeded person gain  _comma_   then it is most definitely wrong . 
i agree .  stealing someone else s possession when it wasn t necessary for your survival is despicable! i hate a thief!
my dog disappeared while i was away at college . 
that s so sad _comma_  i m so sorry you had to go through that .  how did it happen?
my mother was walking her in a park and the dog fell down a cliff .   she was never found or recovered . 
my goodness _comma_  that sounds like a tragedy .  i m sure she was a great dog friend of yours . 
yes _comma_  i loved her a lot .   it took a long time to get over but it was quite a long time ago at this point . 
i m looking forward to my niece arriving from washington .  i haven t seen her in   years!
do you have some big plans for the visit?
probably not  _comma_   because she is   months pregnant .  her husband is in the military and is away  _comma_   so she will be here when she has her baby .  
uh oh _comma_  have you ever delivered a baby before?
oh no! and i don t plan on it! i ll leave that to the doctors! 
oh right _comma_  i am a doctor . 
oh cool! what kind of doctor?
i am a baby delivering doctor!
oh wow _comma_  you must be very proud of her .  that is quite an accomplishment . 
what was the accomplishment again?
my mother just graduated from nursing school in her    s .  she put in a lot of effort _comma_  and she proved to herself and others that she could do it . 
wow _comma_  that s amazing .  what made her want to go back to school?
i saw a homeless guy the other day on my way home _comma_  and it made me reflect on my own life . 
what about this homeless person had you reevaluating things?
lately   _comma_    i ve been thinking how miserable i am at my job .  as terrible as it sounds   _comma_    when i saw him   _comma_    i thought life could be much worse . 
what s been bothering you at work? are you not being fulfilled enough?
a violent windstorm blew through my town and uprooted a tree in my yard . 
oh no! i hope it didn t fall on anything or anyone!
no _comma_  it missed everything but the lawn .  and then my neighbor was nice enough to bring over his chainsaw and help me cut it up for disposal . 
oh thats really nice! its important to help each other out when things like that happen!
i used to know someone who got incredibly famous . 
who??? male or female . actor or singer?
she s a female singer .  it sort of burns me up because i feel like she doesn t deserve it and she s rather manipulative . 
please tell me who she is!!!!!
sorry _comma_  i won t do that .   but pick the female singer you dislike the most and pretend it s her . 
years ago i used to have such a good time .  i had money to spend _comma_  time to do the things i love .  how i long for those times again!
i know exactly how you feel _comma_  i ve been slipping back into paycheck to paycheck living recently .  it was so much better when i had the money to pay for everything . 
didn t the sun always shine back then _comma_  when we were happy and young and had money?!
hahaha yes   _comma_    you are so right .  then again   _comma_    i m a christian so i am also comforted when i remember that we have a real   _comma_    more important and awesome life to look forward to one day . 
that s true .  i still like to look fondly upon the past  _comma_   but the future will be bright  _comma_   too . 
someone broke into my apartment last week .  i was not home at the time _comma_  but now i worry that they will come back . 
wow _comma_  that s terrible .  was anything stolen or damaged?
yes _comma_  my tv was stolen .  they also clogged every toilet in my apartment .  i think they have just eaten thai food . 
what a story _comma_  it s just unbelievable how these robbers have absolutely no morals . 
i woke up this morning _comma_  and my mailbox had been smashed in .  i think the neighborhood teens had smashed it with a bat . 
that is is awful . did you call the cops
i did _comma_  they are investigating currently .  i hope they find the hoodlums . 
you should install security cameras outside your house . 
i did not get the job that i had interviewed for .  i thought the interview went well _comma_  but i guess not . 
that s rough man .  got any back up interviews lined up?
not as of now .  i have applied to a couple of other jobs . 
i hope that you hear back from them soon .  it ain t going to be rough forever   someone has got to recognize your worth eventually!
last week _comma_  my pants fell down in gym class .  the elastic strap holding them up broke . 
oh no _comma_  that is terrible! what happened? what did you do!
i ran out of the gym crying _comma_  and the whole class pointed and laughed .  
i am so sorry that happened to you!
i love my cat _comma_  but she is driving me crazy constantly rubbing up against my face .  i have so much cat hair in my nose . 
yuck _comma_  sounds like an unpleasant feeling .  how do you even get hair up there!
she keeps walking across my chest and rubs on my face as she walks across .  i know she s being sweet but it tickles .  
well _comma_  at least she loves you .  maybe shoving all her hair up your nose is her way of telling you that . 
i am going on a vacation this thursday! i am very excited!
oh really?! where you headed too?
we are heading to somalia! we had some business dealings to attend to _comma_  and we will be seeing the ocean as well!
wow! thats on the east side of africa isn t it? 
i clogged up the toilet at a female friend s house by accident .  i didn t tell them . 
did you have a severe diarreia or something?
yes _comma_  it is a legitimate medical condition .  i have irritable bowl syndrome . 
i am sure your friend will forgive you . 
i won a prize at an event in my college and felt very happy _comma_  proud
oh cool! how did you win it? 
it was for a chess competition .  
oh cool! i love chess! what did you win? 
they gave a cash money of      .  isn t that cool? have you won any?
i have a coworker that will not stop talking .  he mostly talks about himself
wow that s annoying _comma_  my husband is always telling me about his co workers being the same way .  
yes  _comma_   it is quite frustrating .  i don t mind listening to people  _comma_   but i would like them to ask how i am doing from time to time . 
yeah i see what you mean .  hopefully he might realize eventually . 
i have been waiting on a package my friend sent me to arrive at my house .  i heard a knock at the door but it was a package or my roommate . 
sometimes it is uncomfortable to have to wait for something or someone . 
yeah it is .  i just thought that s what it would be  _comma_   so it dashed my hopes when it wasn t .  i just got keep waiting  _comma_   i guess . 
well  _comma_   a wise man said that having patience was a virtue  _comma_   i think you re becoming a more virtuous person by waiting . 
i fell walking up the stair today .  there was a large group around _comma_  and people laughed at me . 
i think you should always focus on your strength then it won t matter who is there and what they say
that is good advice .  i feel better about this . 
also having at least one  friend in such meetings  would help .  next time  go with someone you know
i was delighted the other day when i got to see a friend that i had not seen in    years . 
that s great _comma_  how wonderful! i hope y all had a good time . 
it was like we just started where we left off over    years ago .  it was like we just seen each last week _comma_  not    years ago . 
how great _comma_  i m glad to hear that . 
i just saw the craziest thing! a baby was riding a dog like a horse outside!
how old was the child?
she couldn t have been older than one!
wow _comma_  that s awfully young for that kind of thing . 
i was doing some freelance website work for a friend of mine and i did a lot of work for it .   sadly  _comma_   it didn t do as well as we had expected it to do  _comma_   even though i put my best work and most effort into it . 
oh that s not good .  it is hard to put all your effort in and have it go nowhere
it is .   we re in the process of revamping and coming up with some new and different ideas so hopefully we can do some revisions and get better results . 
sometimes revamping leads to more amazing results than you could have orginially anticipated
that s what i m hoping for .  it s kinda fun when you have to reach into your bag of tricks to see if anything new is there!  
i m worried that if my aunt doesn t answer her phone _comma_  i won t be able to give her the keys so she can babysit for me this weekend . 
oh no! are you going away this weekend?
yes _comma_  i am going on a business trip by my son has an important tennis match this weekend .  i don t know what i ll do if my aunt doesn t answer soon . 
hopefully _comma_  she answers soon .  maybe she s taking a nap or is in the shower . 
i am always suffering due to lack of money and i wish i could be rich someday
i am in the same boat _comma_  but i think that i can still be very happy and very content with the little bit of money or lack of i have .  
that s good to know .  no wonder we are here doing these tasks
how funny! i know how you feel though .  i have always been poor . 
me too .  my parents have always suffered and so have i .  it is so unfair
happiness is within and i seek that all the time .  even rich people are sad and unhappy .  
that is so true .  but to lead a happy life _comma_  money is necessary to some extent . 
i was really down after i found out that i was not going to be able to move . 
why? how did that happen?
becaue i am stuck at a mine site and no one will buy me out .  no one wants to live at a mine site with land collapsing everywhere .  
that s so sad .  i feel sorry for you .  
i feel sorry for me too!
yeah .  do you have back up plans for this issue?
they are very helpful and i always will be faithful to them
that s nice _comma_  i m glad you feel that way . 
yes _comma_  what about you? do you feel likewise?
i do feel that way _comma_  i try to always have a christian attitude . 
do you follow any particular denomination?
i m so happy to be able to spend time with my best friend .  i was not feeling good and she came over and cheered me up
that s nice of her! it s always good to have friends to fall on
yes _comma_  and she also helped me out and paid one of my bills when i was struggling with money
oh _comma_  that s even better .  that s truly a friend you can rely on .  you re very fortunate . 
i saw this kid on a skateboard the other day .   i thought he was gonna wipe out hard _comma_  but he pulled off some kind of multi flip jump thing that really shocked me . 
skateboarders have some serious skills! i can barely walk a straight line . 
i know   _comma_    right?!  i tried skateboarding once when i was a kid   _comma_    made it to being able to kind of not fall over in a straight line   _comma_    never managed to do anything else . 
we all have different talents .  mine do not lie in those kind of stunts either lol! 
i always say i hate when other moms shame each other but guess what? i do the same thing!
maybe you could try to better that?
i definitely should! i should be nicer to other moms and don t judge them
you could start a trend . 
i love my baby so much! he is teething right now and i don t even know how to help him :(
he will make it
i know he will _comma_  i just wish i could help him .  i gave him tylenol but he was still pretty cranky
it will help eventually
i was walking my dogs the other day and a guy came out with his dog off leash .   the dog ran up and freaked out both my dogs . 
that must have been scary .  it could have gone really badly . 
yeah  _comma_   i was really worried .   my bigger dog got really protective of the smaller one  _comma_   but thankfully they didn t actually get into a fight . 
i hope the owner knows better next time . 
i just recently finished potty training my dog _comma_  that was quite the nightmare with sooo many puddles needing cleaned up . 
oh man! i hear you .  i rescue animals and it is very hard to potty train them!
i can imagine a rescue  _comma_   generally being a little bit older than a fresh   week old someone would get  _comma_   can be much harder .  it s a painful process for sure!
for sure! it is much like potty training a kid .  actually i think dogs are easier then kids lol!
my dog started looking really sick and in pain  _comma_   but i didn t have the money to take him to an emergency vet  _comma_   so i had to ask my parents for a loan until i got paid . 
that is stressful .   are they ok?
yeah  _comma_   he s fine now .   it was some kind of stomach thing  _comma_   but he got medicine and rest and is good now . 
that is really good to hear
i was sitting on my back deck drinking a cup of coffee and just felt so wholesome and happy with life .  it was great  .  you ever have any of those moments?
i certainly do .   lucky to be healthy and able
i always try to look for the small things .  i got to see a hummingbird today and that was great .  anything small in your life make a big impact?
good question .   i am thankful to be able to park my car in my garage!
oh i can agree with that completely! 
i interviewed for a job a while back that i was waiting on hearing about .   i felt like it went well . 
i hope you get the job! what was the position you applied for?
a lab manager at a university .   i ve got my fingers crossed!
that sounds like it pays nice?
have you ever had to file for disability?
no .  why do you ask?
i ve had to recently .  its been really tough . 
i m sorry to hear that .  how far along in the process are you?
do your kids ever do anything cute that turns annoying?
i actually do not have any kids right now
my kids love to tell me what they are doing in their video games .  it was cute at first _comma_  but you can only listen to someone talk about stardew valley for so long . 
i heard that was a really fun game though!
i ve had to help take care of others before as well . 
seems like we all have .  some people shirk having to though . 
yeah _comma_  i m not so lucky .  my wifes been sick and i ve been taking care of her recently . 
oh no . i hope she gets better . 
i failed my driving test twice _comma_  but i was really encouraged and did better the next time . 
well that s good _comma_  sometimes it s our failures that really show us what we re made of .  
i agree _comma_  i practiced and practiced and i was pleased when i passed my third time .  persistence is key . 
congratulations .  i am in my twenties and still can t drive so hopefully i will get my license next year . 
i once went a restaurant _comma_  and i saw rats running around in the back kitchen! 
did you say anything to someone?
i reported it! i was shocked and grossed out _comma_  how can a place like that operate!?
a burger king near me got shut down for that!
do any of your kids play any sports?
no _comma_  i do not have kids .  yours?
my daughter skateboards .  she went down the big ramp the other day .  it was so cool . 
i bet you were really proud!
i was so late for work one day _comma_  i walked out and forgot to put on my pants!
wow .  thats hard to believe lol . 
i was so concerned about getting to work i forgot to throw them on  _comma_   i was so in shock  _comma_   even the neighbors saw .  it was bad . 
yeah _comma_  it sounds that way . 
i had to wait in line for    minutes at the store today .  there was only one poor cashier working . 
that must of been a pain! i hate waiting in lines for cashiers _comma_  they are so slow sometimes . 
the cashier couldn t help it .  the store should hire more people . 
stores should really open more checkouts when it is busy _comma_  especially during rush our!
i was so excited when i got my new puppy _comma_  it was awesome!
man  _comma_   i m so jealous of you .  i love that new puppy stage  _comma_   as tumultuous as it can be .  there s just so much emotion and  new feelings  going on as you watch it grow . 
i agree with you  _comma_   the joy of adding a new member to the family is a wave of emotions  _comma_   positive ones of course!
yeah   _comma_    but then there s also those late nights where you have to take them out because they re not used to holding their pee poop in .  and also them peeing and pooping in the house as they learn not to do that to begin with .  they just have unlimited energy   _comma_    so it s hard to keep up sometimes   _comma_    but also fun!
those were simpler times _comma_  i wish i could go back and relive those days!
what were simpler times?
childhood when you did not have so much to worry about . 
ah  _comma_   i see .  had a great childhood  _comma_   hu?
it was great _comma_  so much time running around outside without a care in the world . 
i felt like i was on the top of the world when i won the science fair in middle school .  no better feeling than that for a small child .  
congrats! that would be really exciting .  what was your project?
my project was to show what farm poop produced the most gas when it decomposed .  i put the poop in a bottle with a balloon on top .  whatever balloon grew the largest _comma_  was the one that released the most gas . 
that s a very interesting topic .  i would have loved to have seen that!
i m sleep training my toddler _comma_  he never slept in his crib before .  he is crying and it makes me feel so bad
i know what that s like .  i have three kids . 
how did you cope with all the crying? we ve been co sleeping since birth and it s breaking my heart to hear him cry
they never slept in the crib lol .  i won t even make my son get a haircut because he cries so much when the clippers get close .  i m the wrong one to come to for advice lol
i just got back from my vacation .  we stayed at a beachfront condo and spent time there _comma_  it was so much fun! we really had a blast!
that sounds heavenly
it was! we hadn t been able to go on a vacation for a couple of years  _comma_   due to personal reasons  _comma_   so you can imagine how we felt when we went!
i envy you .   have fun!
as i look at my    year old son _comma_  i often reflect on when he was smaller .  time really flies!
time sure does fly and change is inevitable
yes _comma_  that s true .  i still can imagine when he was waking up christmas morning to see what santa brought when he was   . 
thinking about past events can be very nostalgic
i want to go on a vacation next month but now i cant . 
what happened?
mys husbands job sucks and they had to cancel his vacation because they arnt staffed right . 
time to find a new job it sounds like! good luck
my son is in his last year of college! we are so excited and looking forward to graduation time!
awesome! what is he in college for?
he s going to be an aerospace engineer! we are very proud of him and how dedicated he is to achieving his dream . 
holy goodness! that is really specialized .  you should be very proud! :)
we took our son to the doctor and luckily he is getting better!
that is very good to hear _comma_  hopefully things truly turn around for him . 
i hope so .  do you have any kids?
not yet _comma_  i just have one dog . 
i went to the flea market last weekend!
oh that s neat! did you find anything good?
well  _comma_   kinda .  i got a bunch of old beanie babies  _comma_   haha . 
oh i remember when those came out and everyone thought they were going to be worth millions someday! 
i know! they were    cents each .  it was crazy .  they had the coolest store there with all sorts of old stuff from the   s and   s .  
i came home the other day to find that my daughter had made all the beds in the house! she is   . 
wow _comma_  that s incredible .  i don t even make my own bed .  
haha me either most days! i was really proud of her and then she said she wanted more chore money! lol
of course .  haha .  why doesn t anyone pay adults to make their beds?
my aggressive pet rat attacked the baby rat and left her a horrible gash on her abdomen!
wow _comma_  that sounds very disgusting . 
it looked so horrible .  i thought for sure the baby was as good as dead . 
i hope the baby rat is okay . 
she s great .  i gave her some medicine and she healed miraculously .  it was almost unbelievable!
my mother became ill a while back and had to be put into the hospital .  i was so concerned _comma_  but she became better after a few days .  such a huge relief!
i m so sorry but great to hear she is better now!
thanks   _comma_    she is .  she had a blood clot in her leg and we didn t know it   _comma_    so it could have been much   _comma_    much worse .  i can t even express how glad i was when she was better!
well i m glad to hear it s resolved . 
i fed a stray cat that was hanging out in my yard yesterday . 
oh that s nice _comma_  i love doing that .  did the cat seem happy?
the cat appeared very relaxed _comma_  but i could tell it was very pensive about my presence .  it took some time to develop some sort of trust . 
well how nice _comma_  that must have been fun . 
one time i was camping out in the woods in california with some friends .  i ended up getting lost on my way back to the camping spot in the middle of the night . 
wow that must have been scary!
if that wasn t frightening enough _comma_  i ended up getting chased by a stranger while i was looking for my camp mates!
how long were you lost for?
i didn t force her into anything .  she seemed to know what she was doing anyway
wow back up there friend _comma_  what are you talking about?
i wish it never happened now .  
context _comma_  what the heck are you talking about?
she was  
seriously what the hell are you talking about??
a little while ago   _comma_    my friend went on another beach vacation .  it was her  rd one for the year .  my family and i hadn t been on vacation for several years   _comma_    due to issues beyond our control   _comma_    so i begrudged her trip a bit . 
being jealous of another person is a perfectly fine response .  despite this  _comma_   you never know what is going on behind the scenes  _comma_   she may have taken out huge loans just to fund her trips . 
yes   _comma_    true   _comma_    i know they tend to let bills go for things like that   _comma_    which i don t do .  
i bet you would go on many vacations if you did the same as her .  instead _comma_  you are being a responsible person and doing what is best for your future . 
i am so happy it s a boy
you just had a baby?! i didn t even know you were expecting!
he ll be here in about   months
i m so happy for you! have you decided on a name yet?
hey _comma_  i just started the keto diet!
good for you! i have heard many great things about keto .  how are you finding it?
it s good so far .  i was overwhelmed at first _comma_  but i rented some books from the library and got a kindle unlimited subscription to find some recipes and info . 
props to you for researching the diet without understanding how it works .  some people are just looking for ways to lose weight fast _comma_  but putting in effort goes a long way . 
thank you  _comma_   i wanted to be completely ready  _comma_   so i compiled meal plans and grocery lists first . 
imagine my surprise after   months of trying .  now we also know it s a boy
you must be over the moon happy . 
i am .  especially when we saw the ultrasound .  takes after his dad if you know what i mean haha
very funny .  have you decided on a name yet?
i just had my sweet    party . 
happy belated birthday! did it turn out the way you had hoped?
well _comma_  about that .  my dad knew i wanted a pink car for my birthday .  but . 
what did you get instead?
a blue one! i m so devastated .  i don t know what to do . 
i recently enrolled back in my university after dropping out   years ago . 
really? that is a good move
i was scared about it at first  _comma_   but so far i have all a s .  i must say  _comma_   i m proud of myself!
you have as because you have high interest in studying  
over the past year i ve been on a weight loss journey of over     pounds . 
wow _comma_  that is truly incredible! what is your secret?
as well as exercise and diet _comma_  by far the most important thing is strong will and determination . 
that is so true! you are a true weight loss warrior i think!
i never liked milk growing up _comma_  because my family drank skim .  
do you like it now?
well   _comma_    first i tried whole milk   _comma_    and that was gross .  but i just tried  % milk   _comma_    and i like it!
i like  % as well .   it s perfect for cereal and chocolate milk!
i agree! i m so happy i can enjoy it now . 
have you tried  %?
no _comma_  but i am satisfied with my choice .  
that s great .    % is much more healthful than whole milk . 
i just got back from our vacation  _comma_   but the drive there was so nerve wracking .  there was heavy rain and traffic  _comma_   and some nighttime driving .  had me on edge
so very bad ya
yes   _comma_    well   _comma_    it was just one of those things i know   _comma_    but still was very tiring and can get to you after that drive . 
ok
recently _comma_  i received the news about my ex boyfriend s relapse . 
oh no! :(   how are you taking it?
it s definitely a hard situation to take in .  he had stopped using when we started dating and was off it for   years until we broke up .  it s very discouraging . 
dang .   please don t blame yourself . 
on my recent vacation to florida _comma_  there was a very long delay at the toll booths of at least    minutes .  this was after   hours of driving! it was such a hassle!
thats pretty long _comma_  how did you manage?
i wanted to pull my hair out lol .  but  _comma_   knew once we were past it  _comma_   there was the beautiful ocean on the other side . finally!
yea  _comma_   something calming helps during fraustrating moments  _comma_   but at least you know how the route is now
robby got me flowers today . 
nice! who s robby? is that your husband?
yes  _comma_   how could you forget? it was a nice surprise  _comma_   but then he said .   happy anniversary .  
aha! was it actually your anniversary today? happy anniversary!
thanks _comma_  but i m so embarrassed that i forgot!! d; 
dad caught me kissing my half aunt
oh  _comma_   wow .  um  _comma_   that s crazy .  why did you do that? 
i was attracted to her .  she was older .  the worst part was getting hit upside the head in front of her
i would imagine! i d do the same thing if i was your dad _comma_  haha . 
me found cave . 
you sound like a caveman
me am caveman .  in cave was paint of cave wife .  wife hunt big mammoth . 
why you no hunt and send wife instead . 
me miss bc .  me miss wife . 
one of the scariest _comma_  yet happiest experiences in my life was finding out that i was going to have a baby . 
oh i can relate to that especially if you are not prepared for it _comma_  it can get really scary
oh  _comma_   we were totally unprepared .  in fact  _comma_   my partner and i were working out of state in a compromising environment .  we had to double on back home to get our lives set up for the big change!
you guys will be alright trust me i  experienced same with my partner and now we are fine .  our kid is a teenager now .  i am happy for you guys
when i was pregnant _comma_  i felt ill until it was over .  the doctors were worried that something was wrong with the baby . 
oh no! i m not sure how all that works _comma_  but i thought that was fairly normal for a pregnat woman
usually the sickness stops within the first few months   _comma_    so the fact that i fell ill so much was worrisome .  despite it all   _comma_    i had a healthy   _comma_    bouncing baby boy .  i never have felt more grateful in my life . 
well i m glad for you! and for him! a new life is exciting
when my dog passed away _comma_  i felt so helpless .  she was old and suffering and i felt angry that there was nothing i could do other than put her down . 
that s so sad .  you did your best .  how old was she?
she was    .  i got her when she was a puppy .  even though the situation was rough _comma_  i m grateful for all the years we did get to spend together . 
that s really good _comma_  though .  it sounds like you gave her a great life . 
i had to sit in the front while she was in the back with him
was he with you or just someone you wanted to be with?
i wanted her .  but he had the money .  and that s what she wanted
in that case _comma_  you are better off without her .  
my son is in college and about to return for his junior year .  we have made sure to put back ample saving to take care of his financial needs .  
oh  _comma_   wow  _comma_   i wish my parents had done that! it would have saved me from the mountain of debt i have now
we felt it was best to make sure to get ready in advance and help as much as we can .  but   _comma_    i know all parents aren t able to do that   _comma_    or feel they shouldn t   _comma_    so i can see both sides!
well  _comma_   i ve always been of the mindset that (if they can) they should help the first   years as that s usually the break in period .  after that  _comma_   the child should be able to manage
after a long few months of being a hermit _comma_  i went out the other day to the shelter to play with some pups!
i bet that felt good to get out and experience that!
it was definitely exciting for me! i haven t been able to play with a dog since my own passed away . 
oh i am sorry to hear that .  i also enjoy dogs .  they are one of life s great joys in my opinion . 
i ve been feeling a bit blue and overwhelmed lately . 
you should take a vacation that will help you relax and see new stuff
i could definitely use one! however _comma_  i have a newborn so i ll have to wait a little while before we can go on some adventures!
oh ok .  in that case let someone very close like your mother come around to help you out .  having someone to talk to helps in times like this
these days my skin has never looked better .  my diet is good  _comma_   my family life is good  _comma_   i ve got good grades .  life is good!
that s awesome .  are you using any special types of lotion?
nope! i believe it is mostly due to diet and lots of water .  it s amazing how much the little changes can impact . 
i ll have to do the same! i wish my skin looked better than it does . 
i flew all the way to new york city to buy a designer dress for the prom . 
you must be wealthy .  i would love to visit nyc
i am  _comma_   thanks  _comma_   but i wouldn t go there .  becky still managed to get the same dress as me! i am so mad!
omg! i know how you feel
i just love playing retro games .  takes me back
oh _comma_  me too! i love digging out my n   and snes from time to time . 
oh yeah? cool .  i like the old sega mega drive games .  the music is just classic on those games
yes _comma_  that yamaha sound chip was magical .  we call it the genesis over here . 
one night   _comma_    i was home alone   _comma_    when suddenly   _comma_    i heard a loud bang!
oh goodness _comma_  what was it?
it was a ghost! i ran into the kitchen to investigate _comma_  and i saw what looked like a white dress flapping out the window .  
wow _comma_  that must have been a terrible experience . 
recently my daughter was voted  most artistic  by her peers! she is so talented and we feel lucky to be her parents . 
so very nice . your doughter . 
yes  _comma_   she has a natural talent  _comma_   but really puts much practice and time into it .  
whove very nice ya and super talent . 
what does that mean?
what does what mean exactly?
this has obviously gone all wrong somewhere
well whatever went wrong _comma_  i hope it can be fixed somehow . 
a year ago _comma_  i found an injured baby kitten in the road while driving . 
oh no! did you take the kitten to an animal hospital or care for it yourself?
i cared for it myself .  now she s my beloved cat _comma_  muffin .  
awe _comma_  that s a sweet story! the kitten got a happy ending!
i m proud that she traveled across the world all by herself .    big suitcases and all
that s great! who did the travelling?
wife .  and she was   months pregnant to boot!
she must be a strong woman . 
there was a storm the other day  _comma_   close to our home .  there was a tornado warning near it  _comma_   so i was afraid and nervous!
oh no .  i hope you got somewhere safe while it was going on . 
yes  _comma_   it luckily passed our home  _comma_   but you just never know!
that s good at least .  living in an area with tornados is so scary!
my brother recently proposed to his girlfriend _comma_  i m really happy for him .  :)
oh that is fantastic! i bet your brother was pretty happy too . 
yeah   _comma_    he gave her my grandmothers rings   _comma_    since they were nice and we had them available .  he s    so he s trying to save money   _comma_    but still wanted her to have something nice . 
that is very sweet .  i think they will have a happy and lasting marriage . 
i can t wait to get a new car soon
that s exciting! what kind are you looking for?
i want a compact suv _comma_  like maybe something like a toyota rav 
ah .  hopefully something with good gas mileage!
not yet ready for the baby _comma_  need fix up his room
ok  _comma_ have you done the need full?
not really .  haven t even started .  got   months to go .  yikes!
ok get started already .  a stich in time saves nine  !
i couldn t buy my brother his gift from an online retailer that starts with an a _comma_  because apparently they don t ship to canada from their  . com website .  :(
oh i think i can guess which retailer you re talking about .  i ve had so many problems with them over the years
yeah   _comma_    it s horrible .  i mean   _comma_    what s so difficult about shipping to canada? you can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address   _comma_    you d think it would be just as simple for a big company like that . 
i know .  canada isn t even overseas in the literal sense _comma_  it s just over the border!
she took me for       in just   weeks .  what a trap
unbelievable .  you must be very angry with her (whoever she is) . 
it s been   years and i m still not over it
neither would i _comma_  i dislike such greedy people 
sat here by myself for    days straight .  car was in the shop being repaired
wow that must have been frustrating .   i hope it didn t cost too much . 
it did actually .  made me so mad .  now i have to save up again
i know how that is .   at least you have your car back!
for   months we were led to believe we would move in to our own place .  lies
i m sorry to hear that .  it sounds very rough .  what happened to it?
instead her stupid grandma moved in to it!
oh jeez that s really awful .  can you get it back?
at the time i didn t think it was bad .  but after she told me she didn t actually like it _comma_  that made me think differently
what didn t she like?
well she had never done it before _comma_  so i thought it was special
well that makes sense . 
i m very proud of her for traveling alone at   months pregnant
congrats you have a baby on the way
yes .  it s a boy
how many kids do you want in total?
my child got sick and i had just made arrangements to go out of town on business .  
oh no .  how did you handle having two such big priorities come up?
i had to tell my boss i couldn t go and i was so stressed about that .  it turned out the weather was bad and all flights go canceled so no one could go . 
oh _comma_  sorry to hear .  i am sure your child was glad you were home .  is she or he feeling better now?
i wish i had money .  then she d sit with me instead of him
sit where?
in the club
the club isn t a great place to find the right kind of girl anyways .   
i don t feel bad .  it s not like i made her do it .  she wanted to
what happened!
she knew what she was doing .  i don t care how old she was .  she knew
this somehow seems inappropriate . 
i know i will save the money i need for the baby
what is your plan to accomplish that? 
just to keep on working as much as i can everyday
just don t over do  _comma_   you have to enjoy being a parent  _comma_   that s a key to happy kids . 
i wish i never did it now .  i thought it wasn t going to come out
did you spill something?
kinda .  i thought it was a secret 
was it liquid ?
it was brutal
what was brutal?
 i didnt shower for a few days and had an important meeting .  i could tell that they could smell me .  i became a tomato  . 
really? no shower for few days?
yes .  homeless for a bit
ok .  i understand 
i feel really bad about cheating on my girlfriend with a mutual friend .  i cant even look her in the eye
i would feel terrible to thats really bad _comma_  you should just tell her and change! 
it was a one time thing .  if i tell her that would break her
the truth can set us free _comma_  probably better for her and you both .  
i was heartbroken when my dad passed away .  still not over it . 
sorry to hear that .  they say time heals everything but i disagree its been   years for me and it still feels like yesterday .  how long for you? 
  years . 
im really sorry for your loss! i hope that someday it gets better for the both of us .  
i was proud to see my kid winning in painting competition .  she seems like a born artist
oh i love seeing kids achieve things! adorable .  good for her! :) 
yeah .  me and my partner are so proud of her
i am sure _comma_  i would be too of my daughter .  you sound like an awesome parent .  
i have always felt really guilty about lying to my parents
oh .  well i understand .  but that was a long time ago right?
yeah _comma_  but still .  that feeling never went away
come clean to them about any major lies _comma_  you ll feel better :)
i never get anxious about knowing that i am fully prepared before i go somewhere
haha .  i feel you .  my mom feels the same way
well _comma_  i guess women are more detail oriented
amen sister! women always keep things in check
i feel like my girlfriend and i are soulmates .  i can never cheat on her
thats really good of you .  she is a lucky gal
yeah well .  this one time this model like girl was so close to seducing me _comma_  i escaped from there right awat
haha .  i guess she was not as good as your girl huh?
my dog passed away earlier this year
oh no _comma_  i m sorry to hear that .  are you considering getting a new dog?
yeah .  but its too soon i feel
i understand _comma_  mine just turned    and i m not looking forward to that day . 
some guy drove past me so fast last week .  i was furious
jeez people just always have to be in a hurry to get no where right .  
yeah .  i barely escaped!
people are just selfish and only consider their own lives! 
what was that?
soory it was mistakenly typed .  
it s okay .   
how was your day?
i m taking the california bar exam to become an attorney in february and i m sooo nervous!
that is pretty cool! what made you want to become a lawyer?
i played a video game when i was younger  _comma_   called phoenix wright: ace attorney  _comma_   and it made me want to become one!
great! i know it can be a tough job  _comma_   i am sure you will do fine  _comma_   keep studying!
once i had been hurt by girl friend and it hurts me more than anything in my life
that sucks . 
yeah that really sucks . 
well there are plenty more girls out there
i fell down at work _comma_  and my khaki pants ripped open . 
oh no .  did you leave?
i didn t .  luckily i had a spare pair of sweatpants in my trunk .  i did end up looking rather odd with a suit jacket and sweatpants . 
like you had a different kind of accident lol
 my grandpa is coming to visit!
that sounds like you are excited for sure! when is he coming and what are yall going to do? 
he is coming next week! we are going to play bingo at the local american legion every night!
honestly that sounds pretty fun to me i havent been to bingo in years .  i love listening to the older people arguing when someone wins .  
 i ate a gas station burrito for lunch .  it was not very appetizing .  actually _comma_  it was absolutely horrible . 
yea i hear ya
yes _comma_  and now my tummy has the rumblies .  my workplace bathroom is a one seater right next to my work crush s desk .  i m not sure if i m gonna make it . 
hope you feel better
how was your day?
it was fine .  how about you?
yeah its an another good day
nothing special . 
oh how was the climate there 
too hot for anything
i managed to accidently flash a dozen people
how did it turn out
it was windy and the wind caught my shirt .   i was like  oops!
seems plausible
yes .   luckily people around me thought it was amusing and not offensive
i have always more trust on my girlfriend
as you should
yeah i do .  i love her a lot
thats cool
what about you?
i have a big exam coming up! my nerves are getting to me . 
ohh good luck!
thanks! it is my final exam for a summer class studying database design .  i actually should be taking it right now . 
thats cool
i get to go the the zoo tomorrow! they opened an exhibit showcasing two of my favorite animal _comma_  the sloth!
oh thats great _comma_  what are the animals?
they have sloths   _comma_    hippos   _comma_    elephants   _comma_    bears!
oh wow _comma_  i love hippos and i don t know what sloth look like will let google help me out :)
i had a guest over that used my restroom _comma_  and they obviously have some sort of digestive issue! they didn t event tell me about it!
that is terrible . 
yes it is .  do you think i should confront them?
maybe? is it that big of a deal to you?
i have been more happy
meaning you have been happier before or you are more happy now than you have been?
happier now beacuse i have been built a new house
oh wow _comma_  that s great! i would be very happy too!
back to school time is always stressful because of how much everything costs now . 
oh its hurts a little
i was able to cover most of it but luckily i had a little help covering the rest of what my kids needed .  even a little help is a big deal
wow thats great
i have watched races in tv
me too! have you ever been to one of them races?
nope iam a street racer
oh cool _comma_  do you live in the city?
i feels happy
that is awesome!  is there a particular reason you are so happy?
because i built a new house
that is something to be happy about!  congratulations!
i have been more happy that i have bought a car
that is an exciting purchase! what kind did you get?
audi q 
that is a nice car! i know you are enjoying that!
my wife bought me a new watch for my birthday! she is such a sweetheart . 
that was such a nice thing to do! she seems very caring!
she is! it was a watch that i had been wanting for a long time .  i have used the same g shock watch for   years (which i love) _comma_  but i wanted the upgraded version . 
that is so nice that she made note that you had been wanting it for so long! 
i just graduated from college! i feel so accomplished . 
that is so exciting! i remember how that felt!
i am very excited about it! although i am a bit nervous about what is to come .  i still need to find a job . 
that will come! the hardest part is over now!
 i am waiting to receive my final grade for a summer college class that i just finished .  i took the final exam yesterday _comma_  and i am not sure what score i will receive . 
i remember how that felt! i always hated having to wait for grades . 
i have  _comma_   too .  i actually took two classes this summer .  i took an online final exam about an hour ago  _comma_   and i scored the grade that i was needing .  the grade i am concerned about is a strategic management course that i also was taking .  the professor was a bit of a stickler when it came to grading . 
awesome! strategic management sounds difficult by itself _comma_  i hope you get the grade you need!
i recently had intercourse with somebody that i hate .  i feel terrible . 
that sounds awful .  are you going to see them again?
no _comma_  i do not think i should .  this person doesn t make me happy . 
it s probably best that you don t see them _comma_  then .  good thinking . 
my mom got really sick for a long time before she died .  i was doing my best to see are as often as i could but i had work and lived   hours away .  
that must have been a difficult time for you . 
the worst thing happened though .  i wasn t able to see her for about a week because of not being allowed a bunch of time off
the company you work for is horrible .  they should have gave you that time off because it was a family emergency . 
i recently went to eat a restaurant that was not very clean .  the whole place had an odd odor and made me uncomfortable . 
ew _comma_  that is not good! i wouldn t have been able to stay and eat . 
i took about two bites from my plate and couldn t eat anymore .  i will not be returning . 
i do not blame you!
i recently returned to my childhood home _comma_  and it brought back a flood of wonderful memories .  i am feeling quite sentimental . 
that is awesome _comma_  i feel the same when i drive by my grandparents old home
yes _comma_  it definitely can be an emotional experience .  were are you close with your grandparents?
yes i was
i was going through some boxes the other day .  i found some old pictures of my kids i thought were gone
that is exciting! i love having pictures to look back on .  
yes  _comma_   definitely! it really made us all start talking about those and other memories  _comma_   good times . 
i love being able to reminisce on the past .  time goes by so fast .  
we had to get out of the house because of hurricane matthew .  it was a scary experience  _comma_   but luckily we d already packed what we needed into the car  _comma_   so could just leave . 
i had hurricane matthew come through where i live too! ne fl  _comma_   i know how you feel  _comma_   only i couldn t get gas for my car because there was no gas anywhere!
oh  _comma_   you poor thing! thankfully  _comma_   we d gassed up and were good to go .  the house survived too .  were you ok?
yeah you thought ahead _comma_  me not so much .  our house was fine but a huge mess to clean up in the yard and no power for   days .  i hope your house was ok too!
ugh .  we had to take the walls back to the studs  _comma_   it was so bad inside .  but thankfully we have wonderful friends  _comma_   who accommodated us and helped with the clean up!
i recently had a doctors appointment that made me very nervous . 
was it a checkup or did you have some health issue?
it started off as a checkup _comma_  but then they requested additional testing . 
did everything go well or do you not know yet?
my neighbors built a treehouse for their children in just one week! i couldn t believe how fast they completed the project!
oh man _comma_  i bet that is fun
yeah if only to be a kid again! have you ever built a treehouse?
no _comma_  i have always wanted one though
i recently had to attend a funeral .  that s never a fun day . 
was it someone you know? sorry for your loss if it was . 
unfortunately yes .  it was my grandmother . 
i m sorry did you get to see her a lot before she passed?
i once went to a doc appointment where i literally sat for three hours in the waiting room and then the doc only spent   min with me
omg! that is terrible .  they should really be considerate of people s time
i wouldn t have minded as much if he actually seemed to care .   if they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing
right .  did he at least apologize for the long wait
oh no he acted like i was bothering him by taking up his time!  it was so annoying!
wow! i would write a review _comma_  and choose another doctor who actually cares about his patient!
i am waiting to take a big test coming up! i feel prepared _comma_  yet i am anxious . 
good luck! what is it on?
thank you! it is my final exam for a summer database applications design class that i am taking .  
how much studying did you do leading up to it?
i am taking a vacation to orange beach  _comma_   alabama in a week! my wife and i visited the area about two years ago  _comma_   and we loved it!
oh man _comma_  i bet that will be fun
we can t wait! have you ever been to the ocean?
i have _comma_  i love going when i can
one time my husband surprised me on our anniversary with a really pretty necklace and a trip to a bed and breakfast!
that s really nice of him! how long have you been married?
we have been married for    years .   another reason it was so surprising was b c he usually just takes me to dinner!
well you made the right choice in man to marry lol .  what kind of necklace?
it was one of those keys to your heart type .   do you know what i mean?
that either sounds like a locket _comma_  or a heart shaped key .  am i close at all?
yes the ones from kay jewelers that is a key with the heart at the top
cool i think i saw a commercial for that actually . 
i went to the store for sodas and it ended up being a rough trip . 
ut oh .  what happened?
i dropped my money while my hands were full  _comma_   ran into the door  _comma_   and the bag busted sending a   liter bouncing through the parking lot .  and of course there were a lot of people that saw . 
hehehe .  don t mind if i giggle do you?  you need to remember .  don t feel embarrassed bout silly stuff like that .   those people don t know you or really care .   they laugh like i did because its fun to see things happen to other people that we fear .  
i suspect that my husband is fixing a lot to go to a party _comma_  i suspect he is going to see someone
what are you going to do about it
i m going to take some time and i ll be looking at it with caution
well be careful for sure
sure  .  thanks
my sister is always the sibling that my parents talk about .  sometimes i wonder if they even notice me . 
i am sorry to hear that .  have you ever talked to your parents about that?
i haven t .  i m scared that it would just make the situation worse .  do you think i should tell them how i feel?
yes  _comma_   you do . otherwise  _comma_   you are going to carry that pain the rest of your life . 
my boss finally realized all the hard work i ve been doing lately . 
that is great that your hard work has paid off . 
things have been slow at work and no one has gotten any raises lately _comma_  but mine finally came through at a good time!
now you having something to celebrate .  congrats!
thanks .  and it s the weekend .  perfect timing . 
i was on an airplane last week  _comma_   and someone s baby would not stop crying .  i know it isn t right to be upset about such things  _comma_   but it really bothered me . 
dont worry _comma_  anyone would have felt the same way .  if it makes you feel better remember that we were all babies once . 
i tried to think about that  _comma_   but i was still aggravated .  on the plus side  _comma_   at least i was self aware that it was somewhat irrational . 
yeah thats important _comma_  did you have music you could have listened to or something?
i was given a job offer at a new company .  i decided to stay with my current organization out of loyalty . 
loyalty is a good thing
yes  _comma_   i think so as well .  the new company offered me approximately      _comma_      more a year than my current business is paying though . 
oh wow _comma_  that is loyalty for sure
my grandma sent me a birthday card in the mail! she is such a sweet lady . 
i wish i had a grandma .  did she send you anything extra?
i can understand that .  she is the only grandparent that i have left .  she only sent a card _comma_  but she is living on a fixed income . 
that is still really sweet .   i never knew any of mine .   treasure her while you can!
a tornado blew through my town last week .  my family hid in our storm shelter _comma_  but i wasn t sure if we were going to survive it unscathed . 
wow _comma_  must have been rather frightening .  glad you are ok!
thank you! we were rather frightened _comma_  and we feel very fortunate .  tornadoes are quite the force of nature .  no pun intended . 
i hope you have all the emergency essentials you need for next time . 
hello the plants in my garden i water them  _comma_   i move the earth  _comma_   i try to keep them happy
gardening can be peaceful
especially when you feel something special by nature
nature is a wonderful thing
i hope this feeling increases
my wife has a big birthday coming up and i ve got a great weekend all laid out for her . 
oh how exciting!  what do you have planned?
we are going to eat tonight .  then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend .  i even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years . 
i bet she is going to be so surprised!  is she hard to surpise?
yes she kind of is .  i dont think she knows _comma_  but i can t really tell for sure . 
well i m sure everything will go great!
once in college this guy i was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream .   i could tell he really liked me and i didn t want to lead him on so i told him i had a headache .   i know that he knew i was lying and i still feel guilty to this day about that!
yeah that s tough .  but can you imagine how bad you might feel if he had a really good time on the date and really thought things were going somewhere with the two of you?
yes _comma_  i know thats what i was thinking .   i just don t know if i should have said the truth that i didn t like him that way instead of lying and saying i had a headache . 
that is true .  either way it seems like he definitely got the hint .  
last week i had thai food for lunch   _comma_    and it didn t sit well with my stomach .  i had some explosive issues later in the day at work   _comma_    and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers  cubicles .  needless to say   _comma_    the stench ended the workday a little early . 
oh wow _comma_  i have heard that can happen with that food
yes _comma_  it was quite the uncomfortable experience .  now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname  diarrhea joe 
ha _comma_  that is funny
i was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom .  it looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom _comma_  ever!
ewww! that is just super gross dude!
i know! the worst part is that i have irritable bowel syndrome _comma_  and i made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!
oh man that is just crazy! feel bad for the person who has to clean it . 
i stole a tv from a local appliance store .  it is a    inch behemoth  _comma_   but i am feeling a little guilty .  on the plus side  _comma_   the  k picture is astounding!
i would love to have that tv
yes _comma_  i am torn between my desire to keep the tv and my guilt .  what should i do?
keep it _comma_  the guilt will go away
it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat . 
women these days .  i don t think i ll ever understand them . 
me either .  if you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me .  i d rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up . 
exactly _comma_  sometimes i think women like drama . 
i recently had a long weekend with some old friends .  it was fantastic . 
it must have been fun to catch up with them . 
it was .  we ve spent a lot of time together and apart now _comma_  so it was good to catchup . 
well i hope you guys continue to stay in touch . 
i just finished two college classes that i have been taking this summer! i am glad to be done . 
going to college is a good thing _comma_  but taking classes in the summer can really stink .  at least you ll get to graduate sooner . 
yes  _comma_   exactly! my professor seemed to be a compulsive liar .  for instance  _comma_   two days ago he claimed that a local church used their  personal fire department  (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church s tax exemptions .  ludicrous!
that is the craziest thing i have ever heard . 
not long ago i realized we are more financially stable than i think we have ever been . 
that s awesome .  what are you going to do about it?
keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!
i m envious .  do you have any idea of what those plans are?
my friends help me and they scold me when necessary  .  god will give you happiness
oh i know friends like those
i wish they did not suffer _comma_  because it is my suffering
i believe you
thanks for your comprehension
not long ago we had a horrible storm come through .  you could barely see   feet outside the window . 
oh wow _comma_  sounds dangerous .  were you able to stay home and not venture out in it?
by the time we noticed how bad it was _comma_  we had to stay put .  our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter .  we piled in the bathroom til it passed . 
did you have any damage to your home?
i have a disease called lupus .   because i am so sick from this it causes me to lose alot of friends .   i am not able to go out and hand out like i use to because i am just to sick to get out .   it makes me lonely . 
that s really sad .  is there a cure for lupus?
no unfortunately there isn t .   you can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn t guaranteed
i am sorry about that .  is it contagious?
no it is an autoimmune disease
hi  _comma_   i m separated  _comma_   i m hurt and my heart is broken
when did you get separated? by the way _comma_  that is terrible to hear . 
one month i am desolate  .  i hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel
why are you so down _comma_  my depressed friend?
is that he loved her
this is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen .  couldn t find where it was coming from . 
uh oh!  what did it end up coming from?
went under the sink for something and when i moved it there was a puddle there .  the sink had been leaking and the water was funky . 
yuck!  clean that up quick so it doesn t grow mold!
i recently went on a trip with a woman i adore .  the trip ended poorly  _comma_   though  _comma_   and things have not been the same since . 
i hate to hear that _comma_  what happened that made it end poorly?
we did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together . 
maybe you can plan another trip together soon   sounds like you guys need some time to reconnect and just truly enjoy each other . 
if my upstairs neighbor wakes me at  am again i think i ll explode! i get that she has to go to work _comma_  but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!
i know the feeling . 
you too _comma_  huh? how do you nicely ask someone to shut up? yelling at that time of day just wouldn t be right . 
leave a note on their door .  and at the end put  thanks in advance  lol
nice idea  _comma_   but i don t think subtlety is their strong point   they d be liable to make even more noise  _comma_   lol . 
well _comma_  you can at least try .  
i guess i could .  or i could just move .  still mad though!
you could get earplugs lol
i m seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he ll tell me if he can operate on my hip .  i so hope he says yes _comma_  but the suspense is killing me!
oh man! what happened to your hip?
i fell and fractured it two years ago .  my then surgeon botched the operation and i have to use a walker to get around .  if this new guy can do something i could walk properly again!
oh my god . i had doctors really mess me up too .  i am in a lawsuit .  have you thought about contacting an attorney?
from what i ve read _comma_  unless it s a class action lawsuit my chances are practically nil .  the surgeon ll just lawyer up .  what happened to you?
if it s medical malpractice actually you can get a good amount .  mine is still in talks _comma_  it s only been   months .  medical malpractice lawyers usually take you on for free if they like your case :) you can always try and you won t be charged if you don t win .  it s pretty painless . people killed my child and almost me . 
oh dear lord .  how unbearably dreadful! i hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners .  won t bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn t do it to someone else . 
thank you! i hear you . i didn t want to do it at first . but it s worth it for her . it s a few people i am suing . including midwives .  if it prevents another childs death then its worth it! you should really look in too it _comma_  botched surgery and nerve pain can be horrible! i hope you get better!
the weather here feels kinda mild today _comma_  i m shocked that it s only in the   s in august . 
are you looking forward to the weather this weekend?
i am .  it s not blazing hot so i plan on mowing the grass and getting some yardwork done . 
nice! mowing the lawn isn t fun in the heat unless you re using a super fast one of course
writing speeches makes me nervous
i agree  _comma_   the writing part is easy part  _comma_   but the speaking part is the worst!
yeah _comma_  it seems like the learning curve is impossible! maybe i just need more life experience
maybe so  _comma_   they say to imagine the crowd naked  _comma_   but i don t think that helps too much with the writing part . 
true _comma_  a lot of people don t even have to think about what they re gonna say
i don t watch a lot of kids movies these days _comma_  but they always bring back fond memories
same .  what are your favorites?
i ve seen the movie trolls probably     times _comma_  that and harry potter!
that s funny .  i ve also seen trolls about     times .  my daughter is now sick of it!
yeah  _comma_   sometimes there s more to those movies than you think  _comma_   like they actually considered how adults would react
i ve noticed a lot of the newer kids movies have adult jokes in them . 
yeah _comma_  maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything
yeah maybe that .  they are also lazier . 
getting my first job felt like i had a lot more freedom with my life
yeah i get that .  where did you work?
dairy queen _comma_  it was the only restaurant in my town
oh yum .  not a terrible place to work!
true _comma_  most of my friends worked there too so it wasn t too boring . 
yes  _comma_  work is better with friends . 
yeah  _comma_   so there wasn t too much of a pressure to work really hard  _comma_   it wasn t too busy either
really? i m surprised the only restaurant in town wasn t busy . 
seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day
did you see that happen today?
yeah _comma_  someone paid for this guy s groceries in the store without asking!
that s pretty cool .   what a nice person . 
yeah i think we should have more of that kind of thing
rolling down a huge downhill street with no brakes was fun but nervewracking
whoa!  what were you driving that had no brakes?
i found a bike on the side of the road but didn t test it before coasting down this hill
that sounds quite scary!  did everything turn out ok?
yeah   _comma_    usually i don t trust myself with those kinds of things   _comma_    but i decided to go for it   _comma_    rolled on some grass to lose a little speed
when you re in the sauna and the man next to you decides to take off his towel .  no thanks
haha!  awkward .   what did you do?  did you hurry up and get out of there?
yeah _comma_  i m not good with confrontations
same here .   i would rather just leave the situation . 
i don t think i ve ever regretted not saying anything _comma_  but sometimes i can say the wrong thing or it just comes out wrong
i found out yesterday at work that i m one of the top performers for my district!  i figured i was doing good _comma_  i didn t know i was doing  that  well!
that s great . 
usually at the end of the day it s never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and i was surprised!  been walking on sunshine all weekend!
congrats .  i want a promotion at my job . 
how long have you been there?
three years . 
i m sure you ve done some good work   would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?
i think i m just going to move on . 
my bank refunded me     bucks over a clerical error!
oh wow! what are you going to buy with all that sweet loot? firecrackers?
not sure yet .   i know some of it has to go for groceries  _comma_   but the rest   i should save it  _comma_   my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive . 
that sound like a wise decision .  i think i would just get a blow up doll instead . 
if i had dispensible funds like that   _comma_    there d definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it   _comma_    but alas   _comma_    priorites .    lol 
i found out i was a top ranked performer in my district yesterday!
cool .  does that get a bonus?
i got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family .   that s a good enough bonus for me   the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!   chuckle 
that s awesome .  
i m just happy to be recognized _comma_  especially since most times i just see myself as a  cog in the wheel  . 
well now you know you re pretty great at your job . 
i just do the best i can   that s all anyone really expects . 
so i forgot to get my son a bag of chips from the store today . 
was he upset?
he kinda gave me the  mom _comma_  really?  look but i told him that we d ride to the store in the morning b c i looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff i forgot .    chuckle 
i hate when that happens .  
i do _comma_  too .   i tend to get  mom brain  at the worst times!  i ll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he s    now] . 
i hate ggrocery shopping period .  too many decisions
it s easier with a list but still _comma_  you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into ten things off of the list .   xd
you are so right . 
i forgot to pick up a bag of chips for my son from the grocery store . 
did you go back?
no  _comma_   i didn t .   we live in a rural area and the grocery store is    minutes away .   lucky for him  _comma_   i forgot some other stuff for tomorrow s dinner [mom brain!] and i told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store . 
maybe you should let him get a couple of things to make up for it . 
multiple bags of chips _comma_  to be sure!   chuckle   
or you can get a variety pack!
those are a lifesaver   he s in scouts and he s starting soccer soon .   those    packs are the best!
my landlady was really understanding when i told her that i would be late with rent this month . 
that s nice .  i could get that here . 
i was nervous about talking to her because i hate having to disappoint her   she s related to me .   so i didn t think she d be as cool about it as she was . 
well now you know . 
yeah _comma_  i think that s where the anxiety was   the not knowing . 
i had a big presentation yesterday but i think i nailed it!
noice!  what was it about?
i had to explain global warming to my son s boy scout troop . 
very cool _comma_  are you a scientist?
nope _comma_  just a mom .   i had to do some research on the internet and it was a real eye opener for me .   i believe in global warming but a lot of the facts on both sides of the argument surprised even me . 
i broke up with my boyfriend last week . 
oh no! that s awful .   or maybe a good thing if he wasn t good for you .   how are you feeling?
well  _comma_   i m hanging in there .   this is the first weekend we ve not been together and outside of being online  _comma_   the quiet is kinda loud . 
i bet .   it can be brutal with the change and not having someone but you have to trust yourself that you are doing the right thing .   its a good time to grieve your time together and then move on and find yourself again . 
yeah .   it s a positive that we broke up _comma_  i m just looking for healthy ways to deal with the energy that s left . 
i found out that i m getting a bonus for having the top rating in my district!
congratulations!  that is amazing!  you must be a hard worker .   what do you do?
i help manage distribution for a large company in my city .   really i just hold a clipboard and crunch lots of numbers .   lol
that s an important job though!  you re keeping things running smoothly for that business to thrive .   i m so happy for you .   money is tight for me so when i hear someone getting a bonus . it just makes me so happy for them to get that added chunk of money!
this is my first bonus in    years .   after feeling like a cog in the wheel _comma_  it s nice that someone noticed my hard work!
i was so blissful after the births of both my girls .  such a sense of peace and relief on both a mental and physical level!
i wish i could relate .  i m a male   _comma_    so i ll never know the pain and or the reward that comes with growing a human being inside your body .  it s such an impressive thing to go through   _comma_    and no matter what   _comma_    mothers will never get enough credit .  you deserve serious props .  what ages are they now?
   and   ! it hasn t always been blissful _comma_  as any relationship s journey can attest to! but still a blessing .  and maybe one day you ll be a dad . ?
yeah     _comma_      i ll consider it .  that s a nice thought .  my brothers have had   kids between them     _comma_      so i have plenty of nieces and nephews to deal with in the meantime     _comma_      and they ve given me lots of practice     _comma_      but i m grateful for that .     and        _comma_      that s awesome .  you re almost all the way through getting both of them to a stage where your job becomes a little easier . 
ah _comma_  make the most of your nieces   nephews! you get to be the fun cool understanding uncle    someone maybe a little more objective to turn to (depending on age!)
seems like every time we get a bill and i think i know how much it is _comma_  it
it what?  its way higher?  if that s what you meant to finish with then i totally feel you .   especially during the summer with the air conditioning running so much .   
yes _comma_  that s exactly what i was trying to say haha hit enter too early .  i thought we had lowered the electric use but boy was i wrong!
it is ridiculous .   i found out how they measure power that people use in their houses and it doesn t even sound fair to me .   it averages things because it can t specifically tell .  
the start of school for my   teenagers is less than a week away!
wow _comma_  school is right around the corner
it is! we actually got everything they need and more _comma_  except for a few notebooks .  
well that should relieve some stress
the other day i was just having a really off day .  just couldn t get my mind and body to work right . 
everyone has those kinds of days _comma_  it happens
it does but i m sure the people at the busy store thought i was drunk .  i ran into everything  _comma_   shelves  _comma_   displays and even the door when i was leaving .  
i am sure they have forgotten about it
really didnt want to anything for days
why not? what was wrong?
i studied really hard all night infact but when my results came _comma_  i had nothing to show for it  . 
aww i m sorry .  that s a bummer . 
it is indeed .  wont happen again though
i was attending a conference and heard the minister speak .  he spoke with such grace that i was proud to be from that district  . 
it sounds very motivational . 
it was .  i always questioned how he got the position but it makes sense now
he must be a great speaker . 
i feel uneasy because i don t know if i will be able to save enough money in time
what are you saving for?
baby is due in less than   months
i am sure everything will be fine .  do not stress . 
i worked hard all night for that exam .  it takes   months to get the results back .  the wait is killing me
i hope you did well on it . 
  months to find out !
just hope for the best and don t worry . 
i tried so hard for that exam _comma_  when i found out i got first! it was overwhelming!
that s great!  i m happy for you . 
thanks .  now onto bigger things
what are those things?
starting a clinic
it was the grand opening for our restaurant .  the whole town was there .  almost double the number of people we were expecting
that sounds so exciting! congratulations!
thanks .  i think its an achivement of the whole town
it sounds like you live in a great community . 
i had no confidence and didn t have a girlfriend until age    .  i carried a lot of hatred towards girls because of this
oh man .  hopefully things are different now and you have the confidence that you need!
oh yes .  it all changed when i directed what was inside towards the gym
nothing like taking it out on the weights and gaining the muscles in return! 
i m happy with my daily routine .  i don t like change
i understand that .  i am the same way . 
especially when it comes to food .  like breakfast .  i eat the same thing daily . 
i cannot function if i eat anything other than my usual breakfast . 
i can get fit in   months .  takes discipline 
unfortunately _comma_  i have very little discipline .  i m probably too addicted to carbs to get fit very quickly .  
i eat plenty of carbs .  it s all about timing
how so?
the floods destroyed everything .  the insurer is not returning our calls
wow .  when that happened?
last week .  we re in temporary housing now
sorry to hear that .  i hope your insurer will call you back soon . 
i was just a kid but can t forget that day i left him alone in the rain .  he should ve just taken my hand!
it is unacceptable .  i hope he did not get cold as a result of this
i don t know what happened to that kid to be honest . 
that is pretty sad and heart breaking to see kids in such situations
i recieved a call from my mother today .   she said she was in town . 
do you have plans to get together? 
yes she took me out to a restaurant and presented me with a book i had been wanting . 
how nice of her .  you must have been so happy to see her . 
i can t find another way to earn money
there are usually many ways _comma_  but it depends on what you want to do!
i just want to work from home
well _comma_  we all want to work from home but it takes a lot of work and sweat to make that a reality for most of us
i can t wait for my baby boy .  less than   months to go now
that is so exciting .   what have you done to prepare
you know _comma_  not much to be honest .  just a few clothes and things .  need the buggy asap
the buggy is important _comma_   i have a baby boy of my own . 
i pray to god that every worry will be taken care of .  especially the baby essentials
do you have a baby one the way?
i sure do .  a baby boy .  less than   months to go now but it s hard saving up money .  just had a major car repair .  it has set me way back
do you make enough money to support the baby?
she refused me but then a few days later i saw her and she was embarrassed of her lie .  i was shorter and younger than the other guy . 
oof that is rough . 
yeah .  i put her through hell that school year .  made up all sorts of rumors 
those foids deserve it . 
i got angry when she refused .  but i should ve been more understanding
yes _comma_  you only hurt yourself when you get angry . 
i shouldn t have forced the issue and so i promised never to ask again
give it some time _comma_  maybe she ll change her mind . 
i got my four year old daughter her first tricycle yesterday . 
thats so sweet of you
she was having such a blast she went downhill and toppled over .   she took it like a champ but i was scared . 
oh yea i can imagine glad shes fine
i did so much practice running in preparation for my    metre sprint race at my school!
wow .  do you expect to win?
i do! i am so motivated to win and i believe i am one of the fastest at my school . 
that is nice .  good luck . 
i feel nostalgic when playing old school games with my bro
nice  _comma_   me too  _comma_   are you playing nintendo games?
yes and also sega genesis .  we play these on the xbox one though via emulation
i remember these game well _comma_  like contra and battle toads .  
i was so scared of going onto the train!
was it your first time riding on one? is there something in particular that makes you afraid?
no but i hate going in objects that travel fast _comma_  i really did not want to go on it . 
was it your only choice to get where you were going?
i am going to get us a new car!
great _comma_  what make are getting?
i m not sure yet .  maybe a toyota
toyota is reliable _comma_  are getting an suv?
i introduced my oldest daughter to the movie fight club the other day . 
interesting choice .  did she like it?
she loved it .   she s    _comma_  i was    when it came out and i would watch it all the time with my friends back then . 
that s good to have something in common .  make the memories . 
i can t seem to feel happy but i m not depressed
so what is the problem exactly?
i just feel kinda stuck in life
try doing something you never did before . 
i had pizza at a restaurant a couple days ago and found a hair on my pizza!
it is disgusting .  what did you do?
i told the waited and demanded a refund! it was gross . 
you did good .  you should have called the manager to tell him know . 
i finally got a new bike! i ve been wanting one for so long!
there are so many bike trails available now .  you are going to have a lot of fun . 
i hope so _comma_  my new bike has so many gears .  such an upgrade from my last one! i can t wait to take it out . 
i m glad you were able to get one that you are going to enjoy so much . 
pretty soon i ll be taking over my parents mortgage .   homeownership is on the horizon . 
that s a big step .  i hope it works out for you . 
a huge step .  but i m done with renting and i have a lot of renovating plans in the works . 
i like renovation projects .  and yes _comma_  renting is a waste of money
i m the only one who cares about paying bills .  it s very frustrating
i feel you _comma_  i m in the same boat .   are you in a two income household?
unfortunately no .  it s very hard on me because i have to be disciplined with spending .  makes life very boring
yep  _comma_   money spent on bills and food  _comma_   with little left for fun .   my wife has the same complaint .  
i have a beautiful gray cat named stormy .   unfortunately she s contracted feline aids . 
oh no _comma_  that sounds horrible
yep _comma_  she s pretty far gone now .   i now have to consider putting her down . 
i am sorry _comma_  that is a sad thing to go through
i just got an assigment .   i was doing well on it but rushed through the very end .   now i m not sure i ll be paid . 
why would you not get paid?
i can no longer prove i did the assignment .   computer work is for the birds sometimes . 
i can imagine it is
i found an old picture in a box of my great grandparents . 
oh my _comma_  did it make you emotional?
not visibly .   it was a picture from their wedding day and it brought a smile to my face to see them so young . 
aw hopefully you never lose that picture!
i got a letter from my parents this past friday with a wonderul surprise in it . 
oh what was the surprise?! 
just a little spending cash .   nothing outrageous _comma_  but enough to take the wife out and have a good time with . 
you should go on a little date if you can .  or to the movies!
last night i was walking home from work in a bad part of town _comma_  i was a bit scared . 
you should have taken a uber .  you never know what will happen these days . 
i agree .  it was a bit foolish on my part and i don t want to risk myself nor be worried again .  thanks for the advice . 
no problem .  its also worth carrying a taser or pepper spray . 
when i was    i stole money from a good friend in order to buy some food .   he asked me about it and i denied knowing anything . 
did you pay him back?
no   _comma_    i was going to but he said if he every found out i stole it   _comma_    it wouldn t matter if i paid it back .   so i kept silent   _comma_    its been    years now . 
thats good thetn
i was one percent off from passing my math test _comma_  i was devastated . 
oh my _comma_  so close! but you can try better next time . 
i agree _comma_  i should of studied harder too .  practice makes perfect!
yes and theres no point mulling over it! 
last night i was minding my own business walking down a street in a not so good area of town when someone started to chase me!
wow thats crazy .  what ended up happening!
i managed to get away after a few smart quick turns _comma_  but i was shaking and in fear at the end of the chase .  it was wild . 
wow thats good
i was looking through old stuff in my basement and found my old baseball cards! finding those was like being a kid all over again!
aww .  that must have been a sweet nostaligia .  did you had a collection of those?
i used to collect so many when i was younger _comma_  it was such an awesome feeling to see them again!
i feel happy for ya! i used to collect cards myself _comma_  i still have them
i was feeling so optimistic about getting a new job at houston a while back
that is great! did you manage to land the job?
yeah actually _comma_  i am still working on it .  so much fun!
i m glad to hear that! as long as you keep working hard and trying your best you can do it! 
i was so much in awe when i saw hamilton!
are you talking about the city or a person?
neither _comma_  i am talking about the broadway show :d
i didn t know this broadway show but it seems nice . 
i went to the beach other day .  such an awesome feeling standing there
yeah _comma_  i love going to the beach as well! you must have felt so happy there in that moment!
i most certainly did .  there is something about looking at the calm and glory of the ocean . 
i feel happy and content just sitting here listening to you describe the experience . 
i felt so bad about cheating on my science exam _comma_  it was terrible
oooh no that s awful 
i know _comma_  i am disgusted at myself for doing it .  i just wanted to pass . 
ok but did you pass the test
i m taking my wife out this coming weekend to dance . 
that sound amazing .   dancing is very bonding . 
we haven t been able to go out in quite a long time .   family and life stuff just gets in the way sometimes . 
well _comma_  a night out dancing will go a long way towards reconnecting with the love of your life .   i am happy for you!
my dog passed away couple months back .  i was heartbroken
im sorry to hear that .  what happened?
she got run by a truck .  i felt guilty and blue
oh .  wow .  sorry that it happened . 
i always get sad thinking about my dad . 
oh sorry _comma_  did he pass away?
yeah .  he did .  he had cancer . 
oh my god .  my hearty condolences .  
i went to the beach other day

it feels so good just to hear you say that
i was so happy that i got to see hamilton the other day

i went to visit my family the other day
how did it turn out
it was such a joyful experience .  they always warm my heart
oh congrats on that .  always nice to see family 
a dog chased me through a street the other day
did he catch you?
no i somehow managed to escape .  it was so scary
wow thats good
i feel so caring of my little sister
thats good
yeah .  i always look out for her no matter what the problem is
as you should
i was really nervous when i went to meet my girl s parents
i feel you _comma_  it would be really scary .  how did it turn out?
it turned out well actually _comma_  we had a nice time
so happy for you!
a dog chased me through our street last night
damn! was it a stray dog?
i think so .  it looked like that .  i was shivering when i finally managed to escape
dear god .  i hope you are alright my friend!
i really envy people who can sing
oh really? i believe you wanted to be a singer yourself huh?
yeah .  i did .  i never got the chance to pursue that
well _comma_  it is never too late my friend .  pursue your dreams :)
i had to leave the house for a bit _comma_  before i left i gave my kids instructions on what i wanted them to do around the house . 
did they follow your instructions _comma_  or did they do their own thing?
i figured they would just goof off .   however; when i returned all chores were comples .   i was pretty impressed . 
wow!  i didn t expect that answer from you!  that must have been a great surprise!
i found a bunch of dead mice the other day
oh god .  thats so gross
it was! i felt sick seeing that
i would have thrown up right then and there
how sweet .  bless you!
i was beet red when i realized what had happened . 
thank you _comma_  your so kind
my mother came into town unannounced .   she hardly ever does that . 
is she staying with you ? 
no .   thankfully it was just a visit .   she took us all to dinner _comma_  it was nice . 
sounds like everything went better than expected . 
i was so furious when i found out that my best friend and girl friend had made out
oh dear me .  so sorry to hear that! what did you do?
i have not confronted them .  i am still thinking over it . 
i really hope things work out for you my friend
a big brown roach crawled across the floor in my direction last night . 
disgusting .  was it the flying variety?
yes _comma_  but this one didn t fly .   he just decided to go under the chair i was sitting in . 
gross .   we have those here too .   typically you only see them during the summer . 
my bills and mortgage payment is coming up soon .   i not sure if i can cover them all . 
good for you! that is how it is supposed to be
i am working hard to make sure i can cover them .   hope fully this month of work is better than last month . 
i wish you the very best on that my friend
i made sure everything was set and proper before i went abroad
i feel like is should be prepared
when i got my first car i thought i d finally be able to have a cool social life .   but i was dissapointed quickly . 
oh sorry to hear that .  why didn t it work out?
i spent my first night out at a whataburger _comma_  eating alone . 
aw .  i feel you my friend .  hopefully things get better soon enough
i felt so guilty after lying to my girlfriend
what did you lie about _comma_  and why?
i kissed a mutual friend of ours .  i lied when she checked up on me .  it was a one time thing _comma_  i did not wanted to hurt her . 
best advice .   never confess it . 
i once lied about kissing the most popular girl at my school .  and my friend found out about it
damn! every kid tells such innocent lies .  i bet your were embarassed
i was _comma_  so very much! i avoided my friends for a whole week thenafter
aww .  your story is both cute _comma_  funny and innocent
my four year old daughter came up and told me she thought i needed a big hug and kiss . 
did you give her one of each?
she jumped in my lap and peppered my cheek with kisses .   it was pretty cute . 
aweeee that is pretty cute . 
i felt so very nervous after i agreed to meet my girlfriend s parents
shoot .  i bet it was scary .  how did you handle it?
well _comma_  i lost a few pounds on the weeks leading upto it .  but the actual meeting went well
so glad to hear that buddy .  wishing you are your girl all the very best
i have always wanted to join a college faculty .   i went to school to study philosophy for that reason . 
have you been applying to try to get a position?
unfortunately not .   in the end i ran out of money and had to leave that dream behind . 
that s unfortunate .   what are you doing now?
i feel so sad this time of the year .  my dad passed away this time last year
thankfully they just were checking up on my speed
i m sorry? are you still talking about the cops?
sorry _comma_  something wrong with the chat interface
i feel heartbroken whenever i see a picture of my dog
sorry to hear that!
it is ok .  she passed away few months ago
my son and i went to the track yesterday to run . 
oh no .  did he pass away?
no _comma_  but he did end up puking all over the parking lot afterwards . 
hope you feel better
that is really cool .  i bet it felt nice watching those
uhm .  yeah _comma_  sure .  i concur!
i envy people who can dance really well
oh yeah _comma_  me too .  they have such cool attitude
i was stunned with fear to find a rattlesnake right where i was about to step into last week
holy cow! thats terrifying .  what did you do?
i stood there speechless for a moment _comma_  turned back and ran for my life!
hahaha .  i am sorry   _comma_    i know it was really scary   _comma_    but to think about it now   _comma_    it is really funny as well
needing some extra money _comma_  i used the spare change in my car to buy a scratch off ticket . 
nice .  what type of ticket .  monopoly?  price is right?  scrabble?  bingo?
it was blackjack .   i didn t win anything though . 
better luck next time!  i love to scratch!
i once ate a piece of cake _comma_  it was old .   after the first bite i noticed spots of mold on it . 
that sounds gross _comma_  did you get sick from it?
no i spit it out and listerined my mouth . 
smart move _comma_  at least you noticed it and it wasn t hidden under icing or anything
i was heartbroken when my mom told me that my childhood dog had died
oh god .  sorry .  how are you holding up?
i m coping with it .  so many memories with her
sorry buddy .  hopefully she is at a better place
my brother passed away   years ago and i m still so heartbroken .  it still hurts so much
losing a loved one is never easy  _comma_  especially a brother im sorry for your loss
thank you .  i m sure it will get easier with time .  it was just so tragic _comma_  he was so young
i cant imagine the pain you went through _comma_  i have   brothers and the taught of losing one of them scares me
i am so angry to see so much fake news floating around in the media
i hear ya .  both sides are infected with this issue .  
very true! why does news have to be so hyped up?
well  _comma_   they are looking for more viewers .  it is not news anymore  _comma_   it is entertainment . 
my little girl loves to wake up at night and ask for chocolate milk . 
that is nice .  they are good at that age .  i have a    year old _comma_  and he is currently ignoring me . 
i have an    year old doing the same .   what my   year old doesn t know is i giver her the sugar free version . 
i understand that .  i tried to give him a new table for his apartment  _comma_   and he blatantly ignored me .  i was like  _comma_   well i don t have to give it to you . 
i lost a good job a few years back
that blows dude  _comma_  i bet it was not your fault 
the company got bought by someone else and we all got laid off .   lost my family home and all .   but things are slowly improving . 
so they just cleaned house ? damn that bad  _comma_  i would assume they would have kept some workers 
so i used to shop in walmart and i thought it was the cheapest place to shop at but yesterday i went grocery shopping at aldi s and i was so surprised to see how much cheaper it is to shop there
i thought walmart was pretty cheap .   i ve never been to aldi s
you should give it a try! they have their own brands which are super cheap and the quality is great
i may need to see if i have one near by . 
i am really looking forward to the new season of the lakers
i know right? everyone is _comma_  with lebron james coming in
hell yeah! i am sure we are going to perform really well this season
so true .  lakers going to do well this time around . 
i always feel sad when i think about my dad _comma_  he passed away few years back
oh god .  so sorry to hear that .  may i ask how did it happen?
he had lung cancer . 
sorry .  hopefully he is at a better place now . 
my friends are saying my girlfriend is cheating behind my back _comma_  but i trust her
aww _comma_  such a nice boyfriend in this day and age! she is so lucky . 
may be .  but i have known her all my life _comma_  she would die before going behind my back
i assure you she is a keeper .  marry her buddy!
i have a lot of stuff coming up due this month .   i also have a lot of purchasing goals as well .   i am confident i will be able to meet all of them . 
good _comma_  i hope you make the ends meet
that s the plan _comma_  i ve signed up for a bunch of double shifts .   fingers crossed . 
i wish you the best of luck _comma_  you will be fine!
i was so thrilled to get to see hamilton _comma_  i was really looking forward to it
who is hamilton?
it is the broadway show _comma_  by lin manuel miranda
oh okay _comma_  did you see it in nyc?
my dog started walking again after an accident she had
that is good to hear .   i am sorry to hear she was hurt .  what happened?
she fell down from the first floor . 
ouch .   what kind of dog?
i used to be a member of a very cool dance crew .  i miss those days
i m not a very good dancer .   what kind of dancing did you do?
mostly hip hop .  we were travelling and battling with other teams .  it was really fun
oh wow _comma_  that does sound fun
i wan to participate in a bodybuilding contest! i m sure i will win it!
well   _comma_    if you are willing to try steroids   _comma_    then you might have a chance of winning .  without it   _comma_    it is impossible to even participate
that s not true! i m actually vegan and i don t make steroids and i looks pretty amazing .  i don t need to use none to participate or win
well in those contests  _comma_   you have to be really pumped and by just fruits and vegetables  _comma_   it is very unlikely
i felt so proud when my son got good grades in school last month
for work _comma_  when i got a new job
oh alright then _comma_  feel good
i feel alone whenever i think about my dad _comma_  he passed away last year
i m so sorry .   you have my deepest condolences .  its hard to not feel isolation with the death of someone you are close to .   i can tell you it does get better and you are not alone .   he lives on in you . 
yeah .  i know .  memories still haunt though . 
take joy and pride in the memories you have of him .   they are your personal family movies in your mind .   cherish them because not everyone gets them with their parents .   its good to find support and counseling too if you need it .  take care of yourself . 
i was really nervous when my girl asked me to meet her parents
yeah _comma_  i know that feeling .  how did you handle it?
i was really close to running away _comma_  but i somehow managed to pull it off
good for you buddy :) happy for ya
my friend bought a big house and i m happy for her but at the same time i m a little bit jealous
big houses are a pain in the neck to keep clean . 
true _comma_  but there is so much space for her kid to run and play at and i live in a tiny apartment with my son
it does have its benefits . 
i was so mad when i found out my cousin asked out my girlfriend once
damn _comma_  thats sick and rough .  he knew you guys were together?
sort of _comma_  yes .  he did it anyways .  i yelled at him . 
can t say he did not deserve that . 
i feel happy when i am outside in nature
that s wonderful!  i do too .   i don t take it for granted because i ve been battling lupus for    years and in bed a lot .   its an amazing world we have! what is on of your favorite things to do outside?
i love to garden .  organic gardening   _comma_    i plant peppers   _comma_    cucumbers   _comma_    tomatoes and a bunch of other goodies .  
sounds wonderful!  i really want to take up gardening .   it would go with my new lifestyle i ve adopted of eating plant based .   do you have tips for a beginner?
just get outside and started playing   digging  in the dirt _comma_  you will soon catch on to what works for you .  
i was so in awe when i saw hamilton
the rap version?   doesn t sound all that appealing to me .   was it that good?
it was really awesome dude _comma_  the full show covers it all up
maybe i ll have to check it out
i took my daughter out to the skate park today . 
how did that go
awesome! she went down the big ramp today for the first time .  it was so cool . 
oh thats awesome .  congrats
it really bothers me when people come into where we live at night and ride their dirt bikes
optimism is the faith that leads to achievement 
there is many paths leading to faith
for faith there is no path it is an individual human s thought 
it takes a path to find ones faith
are you a parent . 
i am not _comma_  i am still young
when you become one _comma_  you will never forget the day it happens .  you ll weep of happiness . 
i hope so _comma_  i am still not sure if i want kids
i think i have anxiety attacks! i didn t even know that anxiety causes some physical pain .  like the other day i felt like somebody was chocking me
i have anxiety attacks too _comma_   you feel like you cant catch your breath and you are light headed . 
yes! and i felt like that for   days on and off!
that is crazy _comma_   its only usually a few minutes for me before i can talk myself down . 
we planned our honeymoon and booked a flight but i was so nervous about flying . 
don t worry .  it will be okay .  flights are always safe
i found that out _comma_  after many sleepless nights .  now we fly all the time and i love it .  i feel kind of silly . 
its natural .  do not sweat it . 
my sister recently paid off her house .  i felt so envious of her as i ve been trying to pay mine down . 
that will be  such  a wonderful feeling when you do .  i know it s hard when you see someone reach the  finish line  first    are you able to turn that envy into inspiration?
i really am trying hard to  that s such a great suggestion .  i know i m making good progress to my goal _comma_  and i genuinely am pleased she did it!
see? that s terrific! and she s got to love that you can celebrate her victories too    even more inspiration to support yours!
i used to be soooooo territorial of my boyfriend (now husband of decades!) when were dating . 
i m like that too _comma_  so i can totally relate .  were you able to talk to him about how you felt?
yes    _comma_     but when we were younger    he didn t really understand .  and truly    _comma_     it was more about my own insecurities than about him    _comma_     you know? as i grew more into myself    _comma_     the jealousy loosened its hold . 
i ve felt the same way .  as i have aged and become more comfortable and secure in my marriage and in myself _comma_  those other insecurities and fears dropped off .  good for you for conquering that challenge!
my daughter and her family were on their way from ohio to visit us . 
oh _comma_  that must be exciting! i bet you were busy making preparations . 
i prepared for weeks .  i could not wait for them to get here .  it had been almost a whole year since i had seen them and they have a new baby . 
that sounds like it was a lot to take in! congrats to them!
i cosigned a loan with my son _comma_  expecting he would make the payments and he has let me down by being late every month . 
wow .  what do you plan to do ?
i ve helped me create a repayment plan where i have paid the loan payments and he can catch back up by paying me .  i just really feel frustrated because he has the money _comma_  but he wastes it . 
yea i can understand that
i was anticipating a great weight loss after my first week on my diet!
oh really? how did it go?
i lost   pounds! i am so thrilled because it was challenging to follow the plan all week long .  
great job! i m so happy for you! losing weight is hard!
i have felt some of the best moments of pure happiness seeing someone i love getting something they ve worked hard for    like my daughter s acceptance into her college and major of choice!
that sounds exciting! congratulations to her .  i bet there was a lot of celebration to be had for such an achievement!
absolutely! of course  _comma_   now the real work begins ; ) but her  knowing  that it was her hard work paid off in such a gratifying way    ah  _comma_   so happy for her!
i bet! but at least now  _comma_   like you said  _comma_   she can see what hard work can achieve .  hopefully the path continues in the best way possible and she can get everything you both hope(d) for!
i was disappointed when i realized someone close to me was not who i thought they were . 
did that person betrayed you in any way?
well   _comma_    in a sense .  but to be fair   _comma_    i may have had my own  vision  of who they were and held them to that standard    not really seeing them for who they were .  i have to accept some responsibility for that   _comma_    you know?
don t be so hard on yourself for being a frien and trust another people . 
i ve definitely worked through that! happily _comma_  it hasn t affected my ability to trust    just inspired me to be more truthful with myself and others ; )
i recently met up with a friend i had not seen in a while .  i want to see him again soon and i think i will!
i love reuniting with old friends _comma_  helps me remember and appreciate the good times . 
i agree .  we went to high school and middle school together . 
i bet that was a long time ago!
in college i studied very hard for an upcoming exam that i was very interested in getting a very high score .  i was confident that i did so . 
i m sure you studied hard and should be proud of that! i m positive you nailed it . 
i was very excited with my result .  i am very competitive .  sometimes i wish i were not so competitive . 
being competitive isn t a bad thing unless you let it get in the way of your personal life .  
you are completely right .  it is very important to not lose sight of what is important in life . 
a have a friend that is going to be visiting me this week! i cannot wait!
how did you meet your friend?!
she was a very close college friend and now she lives a few hours south . 
college and high school friends are always close to the heart .  i m glad she lives fairly close!
i am currently dealing with epilepsy unfortunately _comma_  and the doctors have not found a treatment yet . 
that is unfortunate .  i hope that it is able to be treated well . 
thanks .  i have to go to a monitoring unit in two weeks where they will induce seizures to see if they can pinpoint their location .  not going to be fun . 
i hope it goes as smooth as possible .  hang in there . 
thanks again .  i have lots of support so i am fortunate
i ve felt so incredibly sad whenever we ve had to say goodbye to any of our dogs . 
wait _comma_  were they leaving to go somewhere or like dying? either one is a little sad to be honest . 
i know    i needed to just come out and say  when we had to put them down  .  always age or illness related    but man _comma_  so tough . 
it s like losing a family member :(
my friend has been on the couch for a few weeks .  he is getting under my skin now . 
what happened to him? are you guys roommates?
no _comma_  he is a friend that recently got fired and needs some help . 
that is very bad .  unemployed individual can be very frustrating to deal with
i have been trying to lose weight in a group and while i made it to   lbs _comma_  my friends made it to    .  :(
how did they lose so much weight compared to you?
i guess they worked harder but
maybe it has something to do with your diet ?
i went on a road trip with some friends .  we had a wonderful time hanging out on the beach and camping _comma_  too!
getting out of town and way from all of everday life s struggles always sounds like a great time .   did you leave you cell phone at home while you weer away to  really  get away from everything for a minute?
yes _comma_  sometimes i leave it away and that makes me appreciate everything else more . 
that sounds like a really relaxing time _comma_  i m jealous . 
we paid      for a cruise _comma_  but they canceled it with not refunds one week before .  so mad
no refunds for a cancel   week before? that sounds like a total scam! i would be furious .  did you ever find a way to get your money back? because that does not sound legal!
we are currently pursuing a case against them .  they are a local travel company _comma_  so they dont know what they re in for
i hope that you win your money back and then some _comma_  you really deserve it after all of that upset!
i had a wonderful experience with a friend a few years ago .  i wonder if i will see her again any time soon . 
lovely .   what did you do together?
we went to the beach and had some fun in the sun and also ate dinner with some other mutual friends . 
sounds like a great time .   what has brought that memory back up again 
i live alone .  sometimes it can be hard with nobody around . 
that must feel lonely .   you should go out and try to meet some people!
i think that s a great idea .  i will try to go out this weekend . 
good deal!  hopefully then you won t feel so alone!
i saw a huge spider in my car yesterday .  i scared me so!
that is frightening! especially if you didn t know whether it was a harmful spider or not! what did you do?
i stopped the car and got out and ushered it out of the car . 
oh  _comma_   so you were able to get that spider away from you! good job  _comma_   hopefully that won t have to happen to you again!
i hope that this summer i can go to florida with my family
wait _comma_  summers already over? next summer?
summer is not over until labor day! we still have the whole month of august!!
oh really? i thought summer ended after july .  you learn something new everyday lol
summer can be over in july for teachers sometimes .  are you a teacher?
my roommate eats my food sometimes .  this makes me so angry!
you should get a mini fridge and put it in your room _comma_  with a lock on it . 
i think that s a great idea .  i know where to get those fridges for cheap . 
yea man go for it _comma_  don t procrastinate . 
i recently lost my sister to breast cancer .  she was very young and has left three little girls .  i have been devastated . 
wow _comma_  that truly is devastating .  i wish your family can make it through these hard times :(
my parents health has deteriorated rapidly _comma_  and they refuse to go get counseling .  it s very sad for me to see . 
if my sister died to breast cancer _comma_  i would be so depressed to the point of my health deteriorating too .  :(
it s why i think getting a counselor is so important .  no one should be expected to go through this on their own . 
i was recently rejected by a person that i enjoyed .  you can t always get what you want . 
amen to that . life is so unfair it s not even funny . 
life is not fair _comma_  but it is also amazing in that we are here to begin with
life is so complex . we had no idea of the design of that
i m a little anxious about an upcoming move .  it s to a  very  different state with a  very  different climate and way of life!
what is the state and do you like change?
we ve been great with change   _comma_    including a few overseas moves under our belts .  but this is to anchorage! i ve read a lot   _comma_    and there s a lot to be excited about    but man   _comma_    those looooong winters!
oh that is all the way into the cold and wet wild! do you have or will you think of getting sled dogs?
ha! not likely in the city . but hey . who knows! i will use the opportunity to finally learn how to cross country ski . 
lol _comma_  right .  you will have great fun!
the economy has been doing well .  the future looks bright . 
i agree!  things look really good going forward . 
hopefully prosperity will carry over into the next few generations . 
i hope so as well _comma_  especially for my kids sake!
my sister unfortunately will not seek help for her alcohol problems _comma_  and she will not even admit to them .  i am extremely sad apprehensive about what might happen to her . 
im sorry to hear that  _comma_  i hope she can find a way stop this before she spirals out of control
i have been trying to get my family and her friends to have an intervention _comma_  but they have not agreed to it .  she really needs one . 
she really does need an intervention   _comma_   and family and friends would help greatly   _comma_   i hope she can get her life back together 
it was still so unexpected when my husband and i    who were open to getting pregnant    found out that we actually were!
oh my god _comma_  that s excellent! congrats!
oh   _comma_    that was nearly    years ago ; ) but i ll always remember that chicago day   _comma_    halloween   _comma_    visiting the shedd aquarium with friends . 
oh _comma_  lol .  did you get to see any sharks at the aquarium?
the thing i most remember were the beluga whales .  so beautiful _comma_  in their own weird way    and a baby beluga had just been born .  it seemed provident!
oh cool _comma_  yes that is very interesting .  so how big were those whales in feet and the baby too?
the horror film i saw last night can cause nightmares .  it was so scary!
i know how you feel! what did you watch?
i ended up watching the ring! it was ridiculousness . 
it is a pretty good horror . 
my daughter was accepted into harvard .  she starts in the fall . 
that is very impressive .  she going to make sooo much money
she worked so hard and it s really expensive so i hope so!
any employer would hire someone who went to harvard in a heartbeat .  you are a lucky parent!
my friend purchased a new car .  the ride is sweet!
nice what kind of car is it they purchased?
they ended up getting a honda prelude . 
ok that is a nice car what color is it?? 
i graduated college recently .  i m so glad!
that is excellent _comma_  what did you major in?
i majored in environmental engineering!
oh cool .  do you want to work as a scientist?
i cheated on my girlfriend recently .  i feel horrible about myself right now . 
sorry to hear about that .   i wonder if there s any way to fix this situation .   what do you plan to do?
i plan on coming clean at some point _comma_  but i m not sure how to break the news . 
coming clean is a great way to start .   it s hard since you know she ll be hurt .   were you having trouble in the relationship before?
i can not wait until some of my family come in to town .  they will be coming in to town in two weeks . 
when is the last time you seen them?
i saw them last summer which seems so long ago .  i am very excited to see them because i am very close to them . 
that s awesome i hope yall have a good time!
i often get nostalgic when i think back to my high school years .  i had some very good friends . 
do you still talk with any of your older friends?
yes _comma_  i talk with several of them .  i wish i had time to keep up with and talk to more though . 
do you have little time from working or other things?
i saw a horror film last night! it was such a scary experience!
yikes what was it about?
a young girl would come out of the tv if you watched a video . 
creepy .   were you able to fall asleep after watching it?
i am not really a sentimental person but i always feel so special when my husband takes me back to the place we spent our anniversary
that s great .  i bet it is a very special place for you two . 
yes _comma_  it is a very private bed and breakfast and we try to go back as often as we can . 
sounds like a nice little place .  i am glad you two have that spot to share . 
i was devastated when i recently had to my chihuahua riley to sleep .   she had congestive heart failure . 
at least riley passed in their sleep .  hopefully they didn t suffer .  i m sorry you lost a loved one . 
thank you .   she was my constant companion .   i loved her so much
i have a big doofy mutt who is a    lb lap dog in his heart .  i know the feeling
i can not believe that donald trump became president .  it just goes to show you that anyone can become president in the united states . 
i absolutely agree .  i really hope he doesn t win in      . 
we shall see .  i truly believe that he has done some much damage to our country in so many different ways . 
he s like an angry child trying to make everything about himself!
once i was suppose to go visit my sister and nieces who i hadn t seen in forever but i ended up breaking my heal and big toe and wasn t able to go .  i was so upset!
dang _comma_  that sucks .  maybe they can visit you instead?
yeah _comma_  hopefully so .   it isn t healing correctly is the problem or else i would just go in my cast . 
ah _comma_  gotcha .  well i hope you heal fast!
over the summer my family went to alabama to visit family and i felt a lot of emotions
i guess you don t live in alabama? was it overall a good trip . or challenging? or both!
no _comma_  i do not live in alabama .  we drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance
well _comma_  if the drive was the most challenging it sounds like a good trip! too often it s family dynamics that are  more  challenging    and not so easily taken care of .  ; )
i was recently working on a project where unfortunately _comma_  my teammate really didn t pull their weight . 
that is the worst!! i know that you must have been very frustrated with your teammate . 
yep .  especially when you feel that you get dinged for the overall project .  and at the same time  _comma_   you don t want to complain about it  _comma_   because it makes  you  look bad!
there have been a number of times where this has happened to me too .  i hope that doesn t happen to you too much in the future!! :)
i found out yesterday that i have a nest of yellow jacket bees in my front yard .  they can be so aggressive . 
i hate bees and wasps so much .  maybe you should call pest control?
i will be able to take control of it myself as i have done so in the past .  it still makes it difficult because i can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of . 
that sucks _comma_  i hope you get it figured out!
since that earthquake in the early hours of the morning i realized how badly off i would be if i didn t get an emergency packet together .  so that s what i did   cash   _comma_    water   _comma_    important documents   _comma_    a change of clothing . 
wow _comma_  it must have been quite an experience
it was enough to wake me  _comma_   but not the cat  _comma_   lol .  it just made me realize that the big one could happen any time and i would have been up the proverbial creek!
my prayers are with you buddy .  stay safe
thank you  _comma_   i will .  it s just the price you pay to live in paradise  _comma_   right! at least now i won t die of thirst . 
i went back to a horse ranch where i owned horses over    years ago .  good times
awesome .  what breed did you own?
a paint (black and white) and a red quarter horse 
i love paints _comma_  and growing up we had   quarter horses that my dad used for calf roping . 
horses are hard work but the fun is equal to the work .  
the other day i had a flat _comma_  but i had my floor jack and   way lug wrench in my trunk and was able to get my tire changed and get back on the road within    minutes . 
   minutes is a good time to be able to change a tire .  i do not think i could change a tire own my own .  
i ve had so many flats in my life i ve gotten quick at changing them . 
practice makes perfect _comma_  or makes you fast in your case . 
one time  _comma_   my friends were daring me to jump into a very cold spring from a height of around    feet .  i was nervous  _comma_   naturally . 
i would be too! did you to it?
yeah _comma_  i ended up doing it .  i jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably   feet .  my legs went numb from the cold as soon as i landed . 
so did you regret doing it? or were you super proud that you did? 
my dear friend kris just started a job at a gorgeous golf resort on the shores of lake michigan .  the green eyed monster in me wants sooo badly to be there!
you must be so proud!
i am   _comma_    but it s so gorgeous and it s a fantastic golf course .  and i m stuck here   _comma_    bored stupid! i know   _comma_    i m being selfish . 
i don t think you re being selfish _comma_  you re doing your best!
i m trying .  thank you for making me feel better   i really do wish him great success and happiness . 
i m so excited about an upcoming move and life change    it s a move to a verrrry different state _comma_  but should be interesting!
what state are you going to move to?
potentially alaska    anchorage    _comma_     to be specific .  we ve lived in different places before    amsterdam    _comma_     zurich    _comma_     and hong kong .  and even though it s a us state    _comma_     it feels foreign somehow!
oh that is nice _comma_  will you be going skiing?
i feel so relaxed and at peace when i meditate 
who doesn t .   everyone should do it!  have you ever had any mystic experiences while you did it?
no mystic events .  i just feel really relaxed and happy .  
i hear you can travel to different dimensions while meditating . 
my traveling is more like a sleep   trance _comma_  or hypnosis 
once _comma_  i thought somebody was attempting to break into my house . 
it must have being terrifying!
yes _comma_  i was truly frightened .  it ended up being okay though .  it was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about . 
tnank god! they should have let you know they where going to do the job . 
i felt so let down by a person who promised me a project    but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary . 
that s terrible .  people need to learn to commit to their promises . 
especially when it s based on emotion versus honoring a commitment .  and when they know it has a very real economic impact . 
i don t understand how so many people value emotion over logic and reason!
i had to give a presentation in front of my entire university class last semester .  i hate presenting things . 
oh _comma_  that is nerve wracking .  what did you try to do to cope?
honestly _comma_  i took a xanax beforehand .  it was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me . 
better living through chemistry! i m glad you made it through . 
i went to the local farmers market and bought some produce from a farm stall .  i am disabled and the kind farmer   _comma_    despite being busy with other customers   _comma_    took the time to take my purchases to my car .  what a wonderful   _comma_    kind man!
that is really nice of him .   did the other people get mad because they had to wait?
not at all .  they were super nice _comma_  and just kept getting together what they wanted to buy .  i love living here   such nice people . 
lucky you .   where i live people are not so nice .   can i move there?
sure! there s plenty of room  _comma_   lol .  just be sure you like hot  _comma_   steamy summers and lots of golf fanatics!
i am in central fl .  so uhh . 
i get your point   used to live in ne florida myself .  well  _comma_   this farmer fella is going to get lots of business from me  _comma_   that s for sure . 
i was so afraid of going in my barn because i got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn . 
ouch _comma_  i would try and wear something on your neck next time you go in there . 
next time i will get stung somewhere besides my neck
hmm _comma_  wear something thick and long .  maybe hockey pads!
maybe i should bring a can of wasp spray!
so i work at a ups store .  i once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at      . 
ut oh .  what happened?
luckily _comma_  they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store .  so they brought it back when we explained what happened .  i felt awful though . 
but at least you lucked out and they brought it back!
i ve been reminiscing recently about the good old days _comma_  when i was a kid and didn t have to worry about bills and expenses . 
ah  _comma_   i know what you mean! and remember  yearning  to be older?! (and of course the adults in  our  lives were shaking their heads  _comma_   thinking the way we are now ; ))
yes! i wished so much that i would be an adult so i could make my own decisions .  now i wish i could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha
as long as you keep your playful spirit  _comma_   you re in good shape! sometimes it takes work to hold that awareness  _comma_   but i can see it in you!
i love what i do because it s about both inspiring and empowering people to be their best and to excel at their jobs . 
it s awesome to have a job where you feel rewarded through what you do .  what do you do?
i work as a facilitator and team trainer    mostly with a company who i truly love and respect for walking their talk . 
that sounds like a lot of fun  _comma_   it s so rewarding to have a position where you can engage with other people .  you really seem motivating and inspiring  _comma_   so i m happy you have that job!
i waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently     hours i waited .  eventually i got hold of him and he said he couldn t be bothered going out and had forgotten to call .  not too impressed _comma_  frankly . 
what did you do after waiting for   hours?
i bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table .  we had a fine time _comma_  but i sure am wondering about my friendship!
silver linings do happen _comma_  maybe is was a good thing your friend forgot about you . 
could be .  i just feel he was being rather inconsiderate _comma_  which is not something i d expect of him . 
maybe not a true friend after all . 
kind of what i was thinking .  i won t be arranging to meet him again for a while _comma_  that s for sure!
i was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck . 
i bet .  how much did she win and did she offer to share?!
she won    _comma_     and never offered to share .  
that s a lot of money  _comma_   to me anyway .  perhaps she s got a lot of debt to pay off  _comma_   or perhaps she has kids to take care of?
i recently aced a circuits exam that i was very confident in . 
good job! you must have worked hard and prepared .  or are you just naturally really smart?
i wouldn t say naturally smart _comma_  it took a good amount of planning to do well .  we established a study group about   weeks before the test which helped alot . 
well done! you should be proud . 
i am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where i live at will be reclaimed . 
if i m understanding you correctly  _comma_   they re going to clean it up  _comma_   right?
clean up   _comma_    stabilize from future collapses   _comma_    demolish vacant houses open closed roads   _comma_    and so on
wow _comma_  that s fantastic news indeed! how long has it been derelict?
i had a rather unnerving experience this past winter .  being unable to sleep at  am   _comma_    i went outside for a cigarette (i live in an apartment complex) .  suddenly   _comma_    out of the darkness   _comma_    appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black .  they were coming straight at me!
what did they or the person do to you?
well   _comma_    i m in a wheelchair   _comma_    so can t move too quickly .  i just sat looking at them   _comma_    trying to figure out whether i could reach the broom at the corner of the porch . 
broom would be a good choice  _comma_   hit them in the crotch  _comma_   that will stop them . 
well _comma_  that would have been an option .  the person came right up to my porch and said  good morning .  can t sleep either?  it was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and i didn t recognize her with all her winter gear on .  scared the daylights out of me!
my daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick .  i ve been talking to her every day to make her feel better . 
that s sweet .  i m sure she will adjust in time .  have you ever personally had to make a move like your daughter did?
actually   _comma_    i did! i moved across the world to doha   _comma_    qatar to teach for a couple of years .  even though my husband and daughter was with me   _comma_    it was very hard to be away .  have you ever moved far away?
no  _comma_   i never have .  i ve always lived in my state i was born in .  however  _comma_   i did travel to utah which was about      miles away and got a bit homesick so i can relate . 
i had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn t go so well . 
oh no! i hate speaking in front of crowds .  what happened?
there was a lot of stuttering and red face going on .  also _comma_  technical difficulties . 
i know you probably feel like you did a bad job  but i bet you did so much better than you think! be proud of yourself for having the nerve to speak in front of others!
sometimes when people honk in traffic i don t know whether to get angry or be glad!
honking is a way to communicate .  in some countries they honk just to let another driver they are there . 
exactly  _comma_   i think a lot of people are too cautious while driving  _comma_   which makes things even less safe 
going too slow can be just as dangerous as going too fast .  especially in the fast lane!
i recently got accepted to an electrical engineering program at my school . 
that awesome! congratulations! you should be very proud of yourself!
i was very excited when i found out .  have you ever been accepted to anything that you really wanted before?
yes _comma_  i have! it s a great feeling when all of your hard work pays off! best of luck to you!
i was really frightened the other night .  i was home alone and there was a big storm . 
there is a big storm coming where i am living now .  did your power go out?
fortunately  _comma_   it didn t  _comma_   but there was a lot of thunder and lightning .  i think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now .  please stay safe!
oh i will .  also wanted to let you know that if your power does go out to be aware that this is when they come out to play!
i was quite distressed to hear of the passing of anthony bourdain .  that someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful . 
i know!  i was just watching his show on netflix!  so sad _comma_  especially since he had a little girl he is leaving behind . 
indeed .  depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren t enough resources devoted to mental illness _comma_  imo . 
i agree .   he had so much to live for .   i guess it is hard to know what demons people are hiding inside . 
it is .  i read his book kitchen confidential .  he s been battling addiction and demons all his life .  i thought he d found peace _comma_  but i guess not . 
my work supervisor came into my store recently .  i tucked in my shirt  _comma_   left home early  _comma_   and even put my name badge on for the special occasion . 
that is good .  did you have a good time with your supervisor?
i had a great time keeping my job and not being fired! i was on the ball for his visit . 
good job! maybe you will get a promotion too!
i am going to my local amusement park tomorrow and feeling a certain way about it!
which way are you feeling? are you a thrill seeker?
i am indeed .  i am ready to go and ride all of the rides _comma_  roller coasters especially! do you have a favorite theme park?
yeah i really like six flags .  they have some great roller coasters .  have fun tomorrow!
i recently started putting part of my paychecks into a savings account .  i have almost       now . 
keep it up .  soon you ll have enough money to buy a new house . 
that may take awhile _comma_  but for the moment i have a nice emergency fund and am prepared for whatever may come my way . 
exactly _comma_  it feels great when your prepared for the unexpected . 
we all were excited when my sister came home for christmas .  she brought her whole family . 
that s fun .  will anybody be dressing as santa?
haha! nobody ever dresses as santa _comma_  but the kids still believe in santa which is very fun . 
maybe you could pay someone to come into your house as santa! and all the kiddies will be amazed!
i was very upset when i came home to find that my dog had torn up my living room sofa . 
that happened to me one .  i had an american bulldog that had seperation anxiety and tore up my sofa cushions once .  it was like a fluffy murder scene when i got home . 
that s horrible  _comma_   but looking back in the future it will be funny hopefully .  my dog i thought had been trained  _comma_   but she clearly had not!
oh no .  right now you are going crazy but it will be funny like you said in the future . 
i think tv shows make me into a mushy person at times . 
what types of tv shows do you like to watch?
everything really _comma_  i just know i m going to cry if it s sad even if i ve seen it before . 
do you keep the tissue close whenever your are on the tv?
nah _comma_  i don t get to to bad . 
i am very much looking forward to going to busch gardens next week with my family!
ive been to busch gardens before .   they have some really cool roller coasters .   i hope you have a great time . 
i do too .  did you go to the one in williamsburg or in tampa? 
ive been to the one in tampa .   they have this new coaster that rotates forward and backward and spins around .  it was equal parts fun and scary . 
little kids really have no clue about germs i think . 
yea _comma_  i agree .  or they just really don t care . 
this kid dropped his candy bar and then picked it up and ate it . 
did he even hesitate?
not even a little . 
what a little monster!
i can not believe how loyal my dogs are to me .  i am so thankful that they will let me give medicine to them without putting up a fight . 
dogs are the best .  are they ok?  what kind of medicine do you have to give them?
well _comma_  right now they both have an ear infection .  both of them are golden retrievers and they both are very gentle dogs that let me administer medicine without any problems
awww golden retrievers are adorable .   my ex had one of them .   well i hope your dogs feel better soon .   ear infections are no fun at all . 
i had a storm come through recently .  a massive limb fell on top of my roof and now i have to replace the entire roof of my house
that s intense! i hope the damage wasn t all that bad . 
it was very bad .  the entire roof will definitely have to be replaced . 
yes _comma_  get it fixed as soon as possible .  does insurance cover it?
yes _comma_  insurance will cover it thankfully .  i am very lucky . 
i went to a wedding .  i saw many of my friends from my grade school past . 
wow _comma_  you remember your friends from grade school? maybe if i saw them again those memories would come back . 
yes i do .  some of them i am still very fond of . 
well _comma_  i hope you had a really great time .  it sounds like you probably did!
i can t wait for my family to come to town .  my house is all in order for when they come . 
that sounds like fun _comma_  do you have a big family?
no  _comma_   i really don t so it s special .  i would have what many would call a nuclear family  _comma_   you know?
yes i understand _comma_  i have a big family so it s hard for us to all get together at the same time . 
i went to my friend s niece s dance recital this weekend .  i could not believe how well she did . 
ive never been to one of those .   is she really young or is she like a professional dancer?
she is very young _comma_  and she stole the show .  she was hilarious and stood out from all of the rest of the girls . 
thats awesome .   i wish i would have taken dancing lessons when i was younger .   im a horrible dancer
you know you could still do it .  i know you can . 
yea you re right .   maybe ill look into some classes and give it a shot
my son drove down and spent the whole weekend helping me move . 
aw _comma_  that s so nice of him! does he live far away?
he lives about a couple hours away _comma_  but he s young and always busy .  i was very relieved to have some help as it was a big job!
that s a great son .  it s always nice to be able to rely on people close to you to help out when needed
you know sometimes when you just feel like you have to leave a job? well _comma_  that time is now for me and i can not wait for my job interview this week . 
yeah i have had that experience .  one was so bad i left before getting another job .  don t recommend doing that _comma_  lol . 
it is so tempting you re absolutely right .  i m going to try and hang on though _comma_  and thanks for the advice . 
stick it out until you have a backup .  your bank account will thank you!
i found a salad in the back of my refrigerator that i forgot about .  it smelled awful when i opened the container it was in . 
gross .  it would have gone straight into the trash here . 
yes _comma_  it went straight to the outside trash container .  i was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn t smell bad . 
you can use baking soda to get the smell out of it . 
thanks for that information .  i ll try it out . 
last year my sister opened up her own retail store .  it is doing very well _comma_  and i love going to see it . 
that sounds wonderful! what type of store is it?
it has a lot of quirky things that most big box stores don t carry .  it has everything from clothes for all ages _comma_  to jewelry and lots of other things . 
i love that! it must be so much fun to curate the types of things that go in to the store .  do you help out or work there?
i have another job so i can t do too much _comma_  but i love going in to see her .  
i m sure she  loves  having both your presence and your support!
i felt very isolated when we first moved to hong kong    i had a young baby and my husband pretty much needed to start traveling for business right away!
wow _comma_  i can t imagine how you felt living in hong kong .  that would take some serious adapting . 
it did! but there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community    that helped immediately!
i am so happy that you found that expat community .  i have often thought about moving abroad _comma_  and i m glad that you adapted well . 
do it! it gives such a wonderful perspective on the world .  we ve lived in amsterdam and zurich as well . and may very well move to anchorage soon!
i think i might .  it sound exciting _comma_  and i thank you for the encouragement . 
i recently got very sick _comma_  and i had to spend a lot of time in the hospital .  i am very lucky that i have a great family that watched over me . 
that s unfortunate _comma_  but i m happy that you have a good support network to help you out . 
 not a day goes by where i m not thankful .  i m still recovering and they are still there for me . 
i hope you recover well and i m sure you will with good support by your side . 
i find it profoundly sad and disturbing how some people will rationalize someone else s unhinged behavior _comma_  simply to avoid admitting that maybe they made a horrible choice . 
i completely understand that .  did something like that happen recently? 
we re living with it .  and it s dividing us as a society .  i truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change .  definitely working for that!
yes _comma_  i know how you feel .  all we can do is encourage friends to join us in helping to make a difference .  i believe there is hope!
me too!  fist bump  ; )
so yesterday i found out my roommate has been dating someone for   months .  i can t believe he didn t tell me . 
wow _comma_  that s a good amount of time .  is he usually so secretive?
he is usually a very private person .  he hasn t dated anyone in the over   years i ve lived here _comma_  and he s only ever had one friend over . 
ah _comma_  maybe he just wanted to make sure it was going to work before he told anyone .  
i got so annoyed the other day .  got cut off in traffic . 
it should be harder to get a license than it is . 
i agree! do people just not care about risking their own lives never mind anyone else?
it s as if some people think they are the only one s on the road . 
you know my parents still have not gotten over the loss of my sister . 
oh my gosh _comma_  i m so sorry .  may i ask how long ago it was that she passed? 
she passed two days after christmas .  she was very sick during the whole month of december . 
they probably still just need some time .  my grandfather still isn t over the passing of my grandmother and that was over a year ago .  i would just make sure to keep seeing and talking to your parents to make them feel as loved as you can . 
i will _comma_  and thank you so much for the encouragement . 
i ve been passively job hunting for a few months now _comma_  looking for a better job .  i haven t had any luck yet and i m starting to feel like i never will . 
please don t ever give up .  i would definitely work harder to find a job by networking with friends that have jobs in different places . 
well i don t have any friends that are in my field or even close to it .  i m trying the best i can and am trying to find other ways to make money too .  
go ahead and post your resume on as many job related forums that you can .  i think it s great that you re trying to find other ways of making money too .  you are a go getter _comma_  and don t ever give up!!
one of my much younger sister s is starting college in a couple weeks .  i am so excited for her . 
that is awesome .  do you know what she wants to study?
she told me she wants to become a dentist _comma_  but she s a little fickle .  i will see what she says she wants to do in a year .  
as long as it is something she enjoys .  i am sure you are very proud of her!
june and july are very busy _comma_  june i prep plans for july .  july i have company all month . 
it has been really busy even for me at work  _comma_  i feel your pain
so much for relaxing during the summer?
i know right ? unfortunately for us those are the perks of growing up lol
do you even know how crazy it is to skydive? i must have been absolutely nuts when i did it . 
oh i don t think i could do that .  i have a fear of falling from high places .  
it gave me the biggest rush that s for sure .  but on the way down i was saying my prayers . 
i think i would pass out from fear lol . 
you should do it sometime .  it s fun to take chances . 
i think the chances i take should be directly proportionate to the consequences of the actions . 
i have recently become vegan and i am very impressed with the food
that is interesting .  do you miss meat or dairy at all?
i had to start eating this way because of health reasons and i have found some amazing recipes on pinterest .    it makes me not miss meat or dairy at all
that is good to hear .  i wish you the best of luck with your new diet . 
i have to get these shots in my head for migraines . 
i have to trust my doc completely that he has steady hands and will inject the nerve correctly . 
oh man that sounds like serious stuff  _comma_ and it sounds really scary as well hope everything goes great
when my mom had breast cancer a few years ago .  i wanted to do everything i could to be there for her . 
that s terrible to hear .  were you eventually able to be there?
i was and she was had a full recovery .  
that s great news .  i don t know what i would do if my mom passed . 
me neither _comma_  my mom means so much to me .  
me too .  i m glad everytihng worked out in the end for you . 
do you get to see your mom often?
not very often .  she lives about   hours away driving time . 
i saw a dodge viper in the parking lot yesterday .  probably one of the coolest american made cars!
those cars are pretty slick _comma_  what color was it?
it was blue with white racing stripes .  
wow  _comma_   one day i hope to have enough money for a car like that  _comma_   that s awesome
same here _comma_  they are pretty expensive .  
my dog chewed up one of my flip flops the other day .  now i have to throw them out . 
ugh my dog has destroyed all of my favorite shoes . 
this is the first one she tore up .  my roommate was watching her while i was out of town .  i m sorry about your shoes . 
i dont really like dogs for that reason .   they are fun to pet but taking care of them is a chore . 
my wife surprised me on my birthday with an amazing homemade dinner . 
that sounds like you have a great wife .   what did she make you?
she made me ribs and a cheesecake for dessert .  
yummy _comma_  you are making me hungry .   happy belated birthday!
thank you! what is your favorite meal?
i always love pizza!
me too _comma_  do you have a favorite flavor?
my long term boyfriend and i broke up recently .  i m so lost right now . 
when that happened to me i watched a lot of movies   _comma_   for some reason the sad movies made me cry  _comma_   but just be strong and patient one day you realize you can do better or find someone new
i know _comma_  it s just so frustrating after spending so long building your lives together .  
it happens to the best of us  _comma_   and i totally understand where your coming from   _comma_   spend some time with your friends or loved ones 
my grandfather invited me over and made us an awesome dinner today .  i was so hungry .  
what did he cook that is such an exciting way to spend your day with your papa . 
he made us a pot roast with carrots and potatoes .  it s melt in your mouth good . 
that sounds so delicious i would have loved a plate of that food any deserts 
i got a promotion in work .  i am so excited for the raise and added responsibility .  
congratulations! sounds like you re ready for the new position . 
thank you _comma_  i am so excited .  it has taken   years of hard work to earn this promotion . 
what is your work area?
i work in the military 
my daughter can say so many new words _comma_  love to see her thrive!
that is so exciting! such a fun time in life to watch them discover new things and always be such a surprise with what you didn t know that they already knew! ha ha _comma_  that s a tongue twister . 
yes _comma_  thank you! having children is a wonderfull blessing .  couldn t imagine my life without my daughter .  do you have children?
i do!  an   year old daughter and   year old son .   they are my life as well so i totally get what you re saying .   how old is your daughter?
i ve got all of my bags packed  _comma_   passport ready  _comma_   and i m not even leaving for vacation until next week . 
where are you going
i m going to japan .  i m so excited _comma_  i ve never been . 
oh wow _comma_  i hope you have fun
so my parents took me out to dinner for my birthday tonight . 
happy birthday!!!!  did you have a nice time?
thanks! i had an awesome time .  i went to a sushi place and it was delicious . 
i love sushi .   did you get a spicy tuna roll?
i did indeed .  along with every other kind of roll that they had _comma_  haha . 
sounds good .   you have some generous parents . 
so yesterday i went for a bike ride in my city s park .  the weather was perfect!
very nice   _comma_    wind in your hair   _comma_    exercise   _comma_    and fresh air .   did you have a good time?
it was wonderful .  i felt at peace as i rode by all of the flower gardens and fountains .  do you visit any parks or gardens in your area?
i am actually home bound _comma_  but i love to live through other peoples experiences .   my wife and kids go out and bring back stories of their adventures .   i love it!
it s so quiet in my house _comma_  just watching tv by myself .  wish my family was around . 
i know how you feel .   i moved away from my family and friends this summer .   do you have family nearby at all? i often feel lonely when i m watching a movie by myself but then i remind myself that i m loved by a lot of people . 
that is a great attitude to have  _comma_   my husband is in the military so he is gone a lot to other countries .  my family is about    _comma_      miles away in alaska!
you are so strong!  please thank your husband for his service and thank you for being his support _comma_  no matter the miles between you .   take care of yourself and get out with friends when you can!
whenever we moved abroad _comma_  i learned to trust my instinct and sense of adventure . 
you sound like you re embracing life!
ah    thank you! definitely aware of wanting to live life to its fullest .  we ve recently gone through a tough time _comma_  so it feels lovely to focus on adventure again . 
where did you move to?  i feel you .  i am in the same place .   just reversed    years of lupus suffering by going plant based and now i want to live and see the world! i would love to move to italy . 
bless you! what a  relief  and how impressive! we ve lived in amsterdam  _comma_   hong kong and zurich    alaska may be next .  (and italy is awesome  _comma_   by the way!)
it s my brother s   th birthday in a couple days and he s probably getting a nicer car than i currently have .  i m    . 
oh wow _comma_  i d be really jealous of him . 
i certainly am! of course _comma_  i can t be certain yet because i don t know what he s getting .  my car is junk though so it s bound to be better . 
well _comma_  hopefully you can get yourself a better car soon . 
so my brother is turning    soon which means i don t have to drive him around anymore .  score!
that is nice . 
yes indeed! i am very happy about it .  do you have any younger siblings?
i have one younger brother but he is old enough to drive on his own _comma_ 
i saw somebody i hadn t in years .  it was a nice meeting . 
its always nice to catch up
yes it is .  i am glad that i was able to speak with her . 
i hope you keep doing thaty
i love the adventure and perspective of living away from my home state    but that doesn t mean i don t miss elements of it while i m gone!
same here .  i actually moved to the other side of the usa _comma_  and i do miss my home
are you able to visit often? that helps    but it s funny how things never feel  exactly  the same _comma_  you know?
not as often as i would like .  air travel is expensive after all .  i know exactly what you mean though!
i went to a bar a couple days ago and was hit on by a woman .  
were you happy about that _comma_  or creeped out?
i respectfully told her i was not interested _comma_  i already have a wife so i need to be committed .  i would never cheat . 
you re a good guy .  did she take it well?
i recently attended a play .  my friend s acting was significant!
that s really awesome that you supported your friend!
i am very glad that i went and supported him . 
i m sure he really appreciated you support too!
sometimes when i m driving home after a holiday  _comma_   such as christmas  _comma_   i get an overwhelming sense of being alone . 
aw  _comma_   i m sorry .  i know this isn t the best solution  _comma_   but have you considered listening to funny podcasts?
no i haven t _comma_  but that s a decent idea that i may try .  thanks for the suggestion!
no problem! i know you can t always fix everything _comma_  but it s worth trying wierd ideas every now and then
so i recently made buffalo wing sauce from a new recipe i found and it turned out great!
oh wow _comma_  i love that kind of sauce
me too! it only took    minutes to make and now i feel way more sure of myself when making it next time . 
that isnt long at all
i recently completed some additional training at my job .  perhaps a promotion is on its  way?
it is always good to keep our skills up to date .  we never know .  it could also help for a promotion also . 
indeed .  i feel that it is very important to stay caught up on the latest developments .  and the potential for a raise isn t a bad motivator either . 
i hope you get your promotion . 
i am so excited for my baby son to be born _comma_  i am so eager for it to happen!
oh man   _comma_    your life is about to get so much more hectic .  i feel for you .  when my first was born   _comma_    i was just as pumped   _comma_    full of naivety and positivity .  i felt like i could take on anything coming my way .  i was exhausted after two weeks .  it s such a long ride until they re able to even remotely look after themselves . 
i know! hopefully the stress levels are kept to a minimal and i have a very supporting husband who will be there every step of the way .  i hope for a swift and trouble free birth . 
i know you have a lot of work ahead of you    _comma_     but i m sure it will be a rewarding feeling that will be unmatched for the rest of your life .  as a man    _comma_     i can t imagine what you ll have to go through    _comma_     or what you will enjoy    _comma_     but i really commend all women everywhere for the strength they give when having a child . 
so last night i was watching scary videos on youtube while home alone . 
did it scare you?
yes _comma_  i had kind of an eerie and generally unsettling feeling .  i wondered why i did that in the first place .  can you relate?
yes  _comma_   a little bit .  when i was young  _comma_   i didn t like that much scary movies . 
i m ready for football season to start  _comma_   nfl preseason started this week  _comma_   and i can t wait for regular season and i m really looking forward to the ncaa kickoff!
whats your favorite team?
in nfl it s the packers and college is alabama
well for me _comma_  in the nfl i like the cowboys and college its alabama too . 
i visited the bmx park today and saw someone doing a double front flip with their bike _comma_  it was insane!
that s pretty cool .  i bet it s pretty difficult to do something like that . 
i agree _comma_  years of experience and a lot of guts are needed .  you could easily get injured but he pulled it off .  it was crazy to see it in person .  it s the type of stuff you see on tv
i d love to watch people do tricks like this in person myself _comma_  but i m not sure if there s any locations near me . 
my car broke down yesterday but luckily my friend was able to pick me up from work while it was in the shop .  i think i m going to take him to a nice restaurant to say thanks . 
aw i am sorry that happened to you .  i hope the repair didn t cost you too much! 
it was just the carburetor _comma_  which is supposed to be an easy fix .  i m so glad i wasn t stranded at my office . 
ah i see .  something similar happened to my brother too recently while he was picking me up _comma_  so we were stuck at a coffee shop parking lot for several hours .  
i was so set on getting an a on my math test that i studied so hard to do good on it .  i studied for days!
well at least you put in the effort .  what grade did you end up receiving on this test?
i ended up getting an a actually .  it was exactly what i wanted to get . 
that s great! hard work pays off i guess . 
my friend passed away in a car crash a couple days ago _comma_  i m still in shock . 
oh i m sorry .   how are his family doing?
they ve been really closed up about the whole thing  _comma_   i can t contact them or anything .  they must be going through a tough time  _comma_   i could not imagine . 
it s pretty hard to deal with .   one of my friend s buddies died in a car crash as well . 
i realized yesterday i was pregnant _comma_  i was in shock!
woah _comma_  that is huge news .  how are you handling the news . 
i am still in awe _comma_  i think things will turn out fine but it was definitely not expected . 
i am happy to hear that you will be ok .  enjoy having no kids while you can!
when the weather was getting bad and it rained hard in our area _comma_  i was ready for the flooding that was going to happen in our neighborhood .  
that does not sound fun .  what did you do to prepare .  
i had an emergency generator _comma_  extra food and first aid kits at the ready .  i did not want my family in danger . 
that is very smart thinking!
i stole a candy and drink from the gas station once _comma_  i felt terrible about the whole ordeal . 
how old were you? if you were a kid _comma_  that deserves a pass!
i was    _comma_  at that age i should of known better . 
you live and you learn _comma_  at least it was a petty crime and nothing serious!
my friend has had the flu _comma_  and i have been making sure they get better and that they eat . 
that s sweet of you _comma_  the flu is a pretty gnarly sickness to go through .  you sound like a good friend!
aw thank you .  he seems to be recovering pretty well _comma_  just whiny .  
that s good  _comma_   at least he is getting better  _comma_   he ll survive!
i managed to get on the a honor roll at my school _comma_  i was a bit smug and happy for myself about the whole thing . 
there s nothing wrong with that
i m just happy that i got it _comma_  it took a lot of hard work . 
you should celebrate too .  i would
the last time i hung out with a group of friends before moving we watched this really terrible movie . 
that is always disappointing .  did you have a good time with your friends anyway?
yeah  _comma_   it was fun .   we ended up making the best of it  _comma_   making fun of the movie while it was on . 
sounds like you guys know how to have fun no matter what .  you have good friends .  
i remember sitting in the waiting room before my last job interview .   i was sweating and couldn t stop my leg from shaking . 
i too feel the same .  what did happen at last?
the interview went well and i ended up getting the job _comma_  so i guess i worried for nothing :)
yeah _comma_  very good to hear! congrats!
the other day i had to take my dogs out before work _comma_  but my neighbor was right outside with her aggressive yappy dog smoking so i couldn t get out . 
eww _comma_  i hate neighbors that have no class . 
she usually cares enough to at least time her cigarettes so they don t get in the way with things like work _comma_  but not this time . 
maybe you should start a petition in the neighborhood to kick her out . 
i was at a pizza joint and my chair leg broke and i fell to the floor .  everyone in the pizza place all was looking at me on the floor .  my face was so red and the manager came over and helped me up . 
how awful! please tell me you can laugh a little about it now?
now i can laugh  _comma_   but when i was on the floor i was not laughing  _comma_   i just wanted to leave . 
embarrassing things happen to all of us!
my son is    months and he finally learned how to use a spoon and a fork .  i ve been trying to teach him for a couple of months!
amazing! i wish i could see a pic of it!
he is still very messy but he really enjoys eating like a big boy
oh he will be  _comma_   but enjoy it  _comma_   only babies once
when my wife and i started dating _comma_  our second date ended up lasting like    hours . 
that s a pretty long date! where did you guys go?
lunch   _comma_    a zoo   _comma_    my apartment for a while   _comma_    and a movie and dinner .   we just didn t want to go home for the night :p
that sounds like a fun day! my wife and i used to go to movies a lot!
years ago my childhood beagle died from kidney failure .   i found him in the kitchen in the morning _comma_  he did not go easily :(
that s terrible .   was he already very sick?
yeah _comma_  he had diabetes for a few years by that point .   it was just a rough way to go and i hope it didn t take very long . 
im sorry he went through that . 
i remember getting my first job and just working so hard for that first week cause it was retail
those were the days right .  i loved those paychecks no bills .  can we go back to that? 
oh man the thing that got me was waiting for the first check to come in though .  remember that? you re very first one
yeah and i bet it was like a whole     or     bucks and we were probably feeling like a ceo .  
i realized that my bus that i ride to work in every day is a revamped school bus
how does that make you feel? is that a dealbreaker
oh god no thankfully i have fond memories of it .  i just realized how cheap the company is! 
ah _comma_  i guess you have to save money somewhere
i broke up with my girlfriend last week and it was really hard
oh no i am sorry to hear about that _comma_  were you together long?
yeah we where together for about   years but im getting over it now
that s good make yourself available and open for others and you will find the next relationship
i was out at dinner with my family _comma_  and when coming back to the table from the bathroom i somehow accidentally sat down with a different family . 
that is embarassing _comma_  but a good story at least!
yeah _comma_  it certainly lead to a lot of good natured ribbing from my parents :p
that is for sure _comma_  you can always count on parents for that
we are getting our son to go back to college in a few days and it really made me stop and think back to him when he was smaller _comma_  and how time flies by so fast!
it does go fast .  i was just changing my daughters diaper and now she is in junior high!
i know _comma_  that s about how i felt too! i think back to when he was much smaller and how adorable he was when he would call me mommy then!
i miss being called mommy .  one day you ll be called grandma
the last time i went to the fair _comma_  i tripped and fell .  there were so many people around that saw me hit the ground .  you can imagine how i felt!
that is embarassing _comma_  but were you at least okay?
i scuffed my knees a bit   _comma_    but i was okay .  i was also with a person that i really liked   _comma_    so that made it even worse .  but   _comma_    i jumped up super quick lol
well maybe they found that endearing in a way!
i stold some spare change from my parents
how old were you when you did it?
maybe like    _comma_  but i felt bad after so i invited them to dinner
that was nice to repay them back with dinner
yeah i told them as well
my sister passed away several years ago .  i really had a hard time with the grief and couldn t really relate to anyone that tried to help me with it . 
i m sorry to hear that .  i know exactly what you are going through .  my brother tragically passed away   .   years ago .  he was only   
yes      _comma_       i m sure you can relate as well .  ironically      _comma_       that was the same age that my sister passed away .  she took her own life      _comma_       which my mother and i found her      _comma_       and it was very hard for us all .  but      _comma_       i couldn t burden my parents with my pain      _comma_       i felt . 
i know how hard it was for you .  my parents and my brother lived in a different country so i couldn t even go there at that time to be with them .  i felt heartbroken and alone
having a good job is something to thank
to thank whom?
to life god to that higher energy
is that who got you the job?
nobody  .  that s why i m grateful
what job do you have?
i m an administrative assistant for a construction company
are you in a union?
i was devastated when i lost my phone
did you find it ?
i did but it took a while 
well thats good
i was surprised when my family threw me a surprise party
how old did you turn ?
i turned   
congrats
i didn t see my parents since     ! i miss them so much .  it s so sad that i live in a different country
when will you be able to visit?
actually in   weeks! i m so excited about it .  i m going there with my son! they ve never met him
oh boy _comma_  that must be amazing for him
i was annoyed when my favorite show wasn t on
what did you end up watching instead
i ended up watching impractical jokers
thats cool
i love when i need to show someone how to do something and everything goes off without a hitch . 
oh yeah  _comma_   that s always nice .  sometimes they just don t get it  _comma_   though . 
fortunately it s usually just not having the best answer for what they ask .  i ve learned and prepared a lot more this time . 
wow _comma_  you sound pretty confident! you must really know what you re talking about . 
i tend to know a thing or two on occasion . 
i am taking a long overdue and much needed vacation this week .  i wish i didnt have to fly . 
i am afraid to fly too . 
i usually do pretty good on short flights .  longer ones make me a little nervous . 
i know right _comma_  planes make me nervous . 
i hate turbulence too . 
i didnt think to invite my sister to a party i recently helped put on . 
uh oh .  i bet she wasn t happy when she found out . 
no she wasnt .  in all fairness it was a group of people i never would have thought she would have wanted to hang out with . 
yeah  _comma_   i can understand that .  but it probably would have been best to invite her anyway  _comma_   just in case . 
you are right .  guess i know better for next time . 
my sunday was great .  all my chores were done ahead of time .  it was a rare and welcomed day . 
that is awesome .  sundays are usually my veg out days . 
i wish i could more often _comma_  but it rarely happens .  especially during the summer .  my yard grows like literal weeds . 
mine is going crazy with mosquitos
ouch! i would not have had a relaxing sunday if my yard was that way . 
i tried to trim my tomato leaves yesterday but i got bit up so bad i ran back inside
my husband has to travel a lot for work .  it can be hard on a marriage  _comma_   but after almost    years of marriage  _comma_   i have faith he is loyal and faithful when he does . 
what does your husband do for work?
he is an iron worker _comma_  so he has to go state to state at times to build very large buildings .  
my uncle use to be an iron worker _comma_  so i know exactly what you are talking about . 
i ve been married almost    years    _comma_     but many years ago    _comma_     my husband was acting a bit too  chivalrous  to a female acquaintance of ours .  he said he was only being nice    _comma_     but i felt he was being a bit  too nice     _comma_     which made me feel a bit upset .  
that is very understandable .  emotional affair is still a betrayal .  
well    _comma_     we really didn t know her very well and she actually just came to one of our friends house while we were there    _comma_     and she was intoxicated .  he was trying to help her get up and situated    _comma_     but he was very insistent about it    _comma_     even when she didn t want help .  it looked bad to others . 
well it s nice he is kind but yes that is a little strange .  women can usually take that as something and try to get with your man .  
my niece is super talented lately . 
what is her best talent?
art _comma_  she was accepted into a special program for high school . 
does she draw or paint? how any students are in this program?
mostly drawing .  and she s in advanced level classes in most subjects . 
one day my    year old daughter came home crying after she got off the bus .  a teenage boy purposely tripped her as she was getting off and she got hurt .  needless to say  _comma_   i was very  _comma_   very upset!
that is terrible .   i don t know why teenage boys can be so mean .   what did you end up doing?
i actually knew his father   _comma_    so i called and spoke to him about it .  i let him know that if it happened again   _comma_    i couldn t promise her big brother wouldn t take it in his own hands to defend her   _comma_    as he wasn t okay with anyone bullying her . 
that s good that she has a big brother that can defend her against the bigger kids .   it is just terrible that a teenage boy would act that way to a    year old .   no excuse for that .   i hope you don t have to deal with it again _comma_  though . 
i really dont like my husbands job right now . 
i m sorry _comma_  what is his job?
retail _comma_  but he s working nights at a store really far away and it sucks
hopefully they will give him a better shift . 
we are hoping with in a few months . 
each year my husband usually gets a bonus this month or next .  it s not promised _comma_  but it has happened for several years now .  i am really wishing it will be this year too!
hey that s awesome!!!  what are you planning to buy with it?
well     _comma_      we have college tuition     _comma_      just got back from an expensive beach vacation     _comma_      etc .  so     _comma_      if anything replenish some savings     _comma_      right!
that s an awesome _comma_  very adult thing to do!  congrats!
i hate watching movies that are full of gore! i just saw one today and so gross!
i don t like them either .  it makes me sick . 
yes _comma_  i was just flipping through the channels and happened upon a man cutting his own leg off .  yuck!
oh my gosh! that is disgusting!
my husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year  _comma_   but there s no guarantee .  it s difficult waiting  _comma_   and not knowing!
what does your husband do for a job?
my husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year  _comma_   but there s no guarantee .  it s difficult waiting  _comma_   and not knowing!
you already told me that .  is he in sales or something similar?
he is a welder and iron worker _comma_  so he works very hard all year long and does extensive amounts of travel .  he has earned it!
i ve been married a long time _comma_  but my husband is gone quite a bit for work .  i feel a bit by myself at times because of this :(
that is no good! you need someone to be there and take care of you . 
luckily   _comma_    my children still live at home   _comma_    but it s not quite the same .  plus   _comma_    it won t be too long before they are ready to move out
i have never been married  _comma_   so i cant imagine  _comma_    but i would want to be with my spouse every moment of every day . 
my youngest child started high school this year .  it really made me think back to her starting kindergarten _comma_  and how time really goes by .  i can just see her learning to read!
it is so hard and so rewarding to see them grow up .  
yes   _comma_    it really is bittersweet .  but   _comma_    the older they get   _comma_    the easier it is to think back to the younger days!
i bet .   i really want to hold on to mine forever _comma_  but i know that they need to grow up .   i hope you are still able to make memories with yours even as they are getting older . 
i was so scared when i heard a gunshot sound while i was walking through the streets the other day
that is pretty scary .  did you find out where it came from?
no _comma_  i felt it would be better if i dont go looking for it .  i managed to get the hell out of there
smart move .  you don t want to get involved in a gunfight .  glad you made it out safely . 
i feel so sad whenever thoughts about my dad come to me _comma_  he passed away last year
so sorry to hear that .  may i ask how did it happen?
he had terminal stage brain cancer .  we did all we could _comma_  but . 
how sad .  feel better knowing that he is in a better place now buddy
i felt really good about myself when i got a new job at a reputed firm
wow .  congratulations! is your new job near home?
i was so angry when i found out my girlfriend kissed a friend of mine
oh _comma_  that s awful .  what did you do? i would ve dumped her and beat that dude s face in . 
i have not confronted them .  still thinking about it
well  _comma_   i gave you the solution right there  _comma_   buckaroo .  all ya gotta do is execute . 
i went to the beach last week
oh nice .  did you have a good time?
yeah .  so much memories of me and family spending time in beach came to me
aww _comma_  that is really sweet to hear
i was so furious when i found out a coworker badmouthed me to my boss
i don t have a normal job anymore but that would frustrate me as well . 
yeah .  i outperform this person _comma_  and he started throwing shade on me out of pure jealousy
what a disgusting person .  i m just being honest . 
i went to see hamilton last month in nyc
oh the broadway musical? i heard really good reviews of it
it was such a stunning show .  lin manuel should get a grammy for this
oh yeah  _comma_   he is such a true genius of our times  _comma_   he deserves it
i was so ashamed when i threw up in public the other day
oh .  were you sick?
yeah  _comma_   i felt like i was coming down with something .  i rushed to get a cab  _comma_   but i couldn t help it
don t feel bad about it buddy _comma_  this happens to all of us sometime .  feel better
my girlfriend asked me to meet her parents next week
oh dang .  how do you think that is going to go down?
i am not sure to be honest .  i am feeling so nervous about it
i m sure everything will be fine .  just gotta be yourself!
i felt betrayed when my girlfriend kissed another guy at a party
oh no .  that should have sucked for you .  what did you do?
nothing .  she was drunk _comma_  so i let it go .  i still feel disappointed
as you should .  it will pass away _comma_  dont worry
i was really upset when my daughter went into labor and i couldn t be there .  
i m so sorry but what a joyous occasion .  
she lives in another state and wasn t due for several more months .  everyone is fine now though _comma_  so it has turned out to be very joyous . 
so happy for you .  is this your first grandchild?
i was in total shock the night my fiance proposed to me at a concert . 
that sounds like a great place to propose! how did it go?
they started playing one of our special songs and the next think i knew he was down on one knee .  i said yes _comma_  of course!
that s so heartwarming! i hope your relationship works out very well!
i admire my boss because he does not act like a boss .  he acts more like a friend and he is so down to earth .  
that is nice to have a friendly boss . 
he is not just friendly _comma_  he is a good leader and knows how to treat his workers . 
i envy you .  that is cool . 
i remember when i was a kid and in the summertime i used to catch fireflies and place them in a jar by my bedside at night . 
really?
the fireflies would blink in the jar all night long .  
yes i did that too
i m so tired this morning  _comma_   i went to bed early  _comma_   but it seems when i go to bed early i wake up more tired .  it aggravates me!
this happened to me also . 
i hate it! i feel more energized when i get   hours of sleep than i do when i get  !
did you try to exercise?
i m in contract to buy my first house _comma_  fingers crossed closing goes well and i close next friday!
that is so exciting!! buying a house can be such a great experience . 
i m definitely excited .  the house just now got built and i saw it for the first time last monday .  
oh so it is brand new .   i bet you cant wait to move in . 
my mother and i made plans to hang out and do lunch this past week . 
really?
unfortunately she was unable to make it because her diabetes is wreking her health . 
so sorry about that
i am feeling bad because my grandchild wants me to play all the time but i have to work a lot . 
i know how you feel .  i m working right now :(
she doesn t understand why i always have so many other things to do _comma_  but she would literally play      if i had the time . 
can you blame her?   i mean _comma_  if i didn t have bills that s what i d be doing . 
my four year old daughter came to me beaming with pride and showing me a drawing she did of me . 
isn t that the best!  my   year old the same thing!  i couldn t be happier or more proud!
i was really surpised .   i expected a stick figure _comma_  but she drew a lot of features including my beard and mustache . 
she may be a natural artist!
i had to run some errands .   while gone i instructed my older daughters to complete some math assignments . 
i see .  did they complete them?
when i returned i found them playing video games _comma_  the math work was not even attempted .   i tunred their stuff off and we did it together . 
well _comma_  we were kids once too .  we can understand their point of view as well .  glad you got to spend quality time with them though
a recruiter contacted me the other day about potential job openings _comma_  so i m hoping i may have a job soon!
thats really cool! i hope you get one very soon buddy
me too .  i ve been dying to get out of my current job _comma_  but having a recruiter makes me feel at ease . 
yeah  _comma_   i can understand how that can be frustrating .  dont worry  _comma_   things will fall in its place soon enough
i found a box of old photos in my closet yesterday . 
awh memories _comma_  what were they of? 
a lot of them where photos of my sister and i when we were toddlers .   it was a good trip down memory lane . 
so cute _comma_  i love those memories i bet it was beautiful .  
i was disgusted when my dad left me
why did he leave you?
i m not sure .  i guess he just didn t want anything to do with me . 
that s awful and there has to be another reason for it .  i can t stand fathers who behave that way _comma_  despicable .  
i have been rehearsing for a job interview for a couple of weeks now _comma_  and i am so ready!
congratulations on getting an interview .   good job in prepping for it _comma_  i m sure you ll do well . 
i don t normally prepare for interviews  _comma_   but i really want this job  _comma_   so i put in a lot of practice . 
what kind of job is it?
i went to the fride and was surprised to find what i thought was an ice cream cake . 
oh! was the ice cream cake for you?
it turned out to not even be an ice cream cake .   it was some kind of pinapple cake .   i still had a piece but it was disappointing . 
awww that is kind of disappointing .  ice cream cake sounds tastier than pineapple cake . 
i was surprised when my wife left me
oh im so sorry to hear that .  how long were you married?
we were married for    years
it must have felt unbelievably hurtful for you .  i hope you find someone very soon . 
i was annoyed when my family missed my birthday
i can understand that .  i don t get nearly as many birthday wishes as i used to .  i guess it happens as we get older . 
yeah that s very true .  doesn t mean we aren t important though
i agree .  i think they think we don t care about our birthday so they don t care either .  but they are wrong . 
interestingly  _comma_   i also had a job interview recently  _comma_   although i ve already heard back and i got it!
oh! i am so happy for you .  congratulations .  what was the job?
a lab manager for a physics department at a university . 
that sounds very interesting .  i m sure you will do great .  
i had a terrifying experience what using the restroom yesterday . 
what happened??
as i was sitting on the toilet i kept hearing a scratching noise .   when i turned to look a huge waterbug had climbed up the tub wall next to me . 
holy moly! that would have scared me too! did you kill it?
when i was younger _comma_  my dad got into a motor cycle accident .  it made me not want to learn how to drive for almost   years . 
that is understandable .   such an experience can be tramatic .   did you eventually learn?
i did learn _comma_  but it took a long time to overcome my fear .  i m glad i eventually did!
my wife had a similar experience _comma_  she still doesn t drive .   good for you for overcoming it . 
i had to replace my toilet the other day .   it was a new experience _comma_  and not altogether pleasant . 
that sounds miserable!  did you do it yourself?
yeah .   it wasn t terribly hard _comma_  but it definitely took watching a few videos to feel confident . 
at least you saved money doing it yourself!
in college i was in a class with an older woman who stole my ideas for a paper . 
oh wow! that stinks .  im sorry
it s ok .   i m basically over it now _comma_  but it was really angering then . 
i bet it was .  at least its over now 
i was grateful when i married my wife
i bet .   i was the same way .   how did you guys meet?
we met at a store
nice .   that s a relatively unique way to meet .   what store?
when i was in college an older woman in a class of mine stole my ideas for a paper . 
i would be furious .   what did you do?
well _comma_  ranted about it to my girlfriend for a while then talked to the professor to make it clear what she did . 
what was the outcome?  did the professor believe you?
my family and i are close to aquiring a new home . 
that s awesome!  what kind of house is it?
iit is an older home in need of some repairs .   we can t wait to get started on renovations . 
that s gonna be a lot of fun _comma_  but a lot of work .   good luck!
i was excited when i bought my car
that is exciting! what kind of car?
it was a mustang .  i saved up enough money and purchased it outright
wow _comma_  that is impressive .  i ve always liked mustangs .  what color?
i was fast asleep this morning when my cat pounced on me and jolted me awake . 
i ve had pets to do that too . 
it came out of nowhere .  i almost fell out of bed!
well _comma_  i guess it really loves you . 
i m feeling a little down right now .  the weather is perfect _comma_  but i miss not going to the beach with my husband and dog and catching the sunset .  those were great times!
i bet! im sorry you are feeling down . 
yeah  _comma_   we would take a bottle of wine with us  _comma_   watch the surfers and just kick back .  wish those days would return . 
times like that would be so awesome! i hope they come back for you
maybe one day .  that was when i lived in northern california   the best place on the planet _comma_  imho!
i am confident that i will win that spelling bee tomorrow
a spelling bee   what fun! i m sure you will win   i bet you ve worked hard toward your goal . 
i have .  i ve studied for   week now
that s a lot of studying .  well  _comma_   the best of luck to you  _comma_   though i know you won t need it after all that hard work!
i ve been trying lately to potty train my youngest daughter . 
how is it going?
it s been a challenge .   yesterday she got on the toilet herself though .   she said she didn t want to be a baby anymore . 
thats one way to get them .  being a  big girl  is such an accomplishment
my wife has been out of the country for school for a while .   dropping her off at the airport was really hard . 
do you guys get to talk a lot?
yeah  _comma_   we talk by text all the time and call every day .   it s still hard though  _comma_   we haven t been apart longer than a couple days since we met . 
getting through it can only make your relationshipi stronger though
i was sad when my dog died
im sorry to hear that . 
its ok .  it s just been rough without him .  i miss him
was he sick before?
my wife is coming home after being out of the country for   months .   i can t wait!
you must be really excited!
i am!  we ve never been apart this long _comma_  so it s been tough . 
are you planning something special when she comes home?
i was afraid when i watched a horror film
i am sorry to hear that _comma_  they frighten me as well . 
some have pop ups and they are creepy
yes _comma_  those scare me to death when they come out of nowhere . 
i m going on vacation for the first time in several years!
great _comma_  where will you be going?
i m taking a cruise to alaska .  i m soooo excited . 
well _comma_  that will be fantastic .  hope you have a good time . 
my wife is coming back into the country at the end of the weeks after   months away .   i can t wait!
cool beans .  where was she?
germany for a language course . 
did you get to visit? germany is quite beautiful . 
i was prepared for tonights big dinner
where is it gonna be at?
it s going to be at my house .  we are going to have a lot of food
is someone important coming voer?
i was terrified when i watched that horror movie
which one was it
it was scream
it wasn t that scary to me
i was digging through some old stuff i had and i found letters that my wife wrote me when we were still dating .  they were so sweet . 
aww .  thats nnice
yeah! it gave me all of the feels .  i read through them and pretty much fell in love with her all over again . 
no one writes letters anymore .  its kind of sad
i managed to spook myself really bad once watching too many horror movies and being in a house alone by the woods . 
that would definitely creep me out . 
yeah .   i kept thinking trees were people or things standing out in the woods . 
i have done that before lol
i m so proud of my wife
i bet she s a wonderful woman
 she really is
hold on to her
i was angry when my son destroyed my car
oh no is it completely destroyed not salvagable ?
no not salvagable .  i had to buy a new one .  
so sorry to hear about this disaster
its okay .  gave me an opportunity for a new adventure
i m starting a new job next week  _comma_   and while i am excited  _comma_   i am also very nervous!
congratulations!  don t be too nervous!  you must have done something right to get the job in the first place!
that s true _comma_  but the uncertainty always makes me feel a bit nervous . 
that is natural .   i m sure you will do great!
i had to go out of town and leave my dogs with a friend _comma_  i was worried about them . 
did everything go okay?
yeah .   they annoyed my friend some _comma_  but overall it was fine . 
well that s good . 
my wife has been in germany for   months .   i can t wait till she gets home . 
wow _comma_  i bet you miss her so much .  my wife is going overseas with our son and they will be gone for   month! i know i will be miserable without them
it sucks _comma_  but it s best to keep busy with whatever you can .   videogames helped a lot :p
i will play pubg after work to keep me busy lol
my wife has been out of the country for   months .   she s coming back soon _comma_  but it s been tough without her . 
well it will be over soon
i m looking forward to it :)
i bet you are .  i definitely woudl be
i m planning on moving to a new city _comma_  but i m starting to get cold feet . 
what has you so nervous?
i m just unsure about the city . like what if i m miserable there?
have you considered taking a weekend trip there to see how you like it?
one of the things i had to do when i started my job was be in charge of moving a department .   when we were doing it _comma_  one of my coworkers bailed on me . 
did it leave you to do it alone _comma_  or were there others ?
there were others _comma_  but we needed all the help we could get . 
i see how that would be frustrating . 
everybody say a quiet place movie was boring but i still decided to watch it and i was pretty impressed! that movie was so amazing _comma_  i feel like i was holding my breath the whole time
i ve heard about this movie but i ve never had a chance to watch it
omg  _comma_   you should! it s a one of a kind movie .  i don t wanna spoil it  _comma_   it s about aliens
aliens? i didn t think it was about aliens _comma_  i thought it s about ghosts and stuff
it sure must be nice to be able to get all the cool stuff _comma_  and do whatever you want and not have to work for any of it . 
well i wouldn t know lol
yeah me either .  i have some friends that get to experience it .  fortunately they are sharing so that is nice . 
i don t have any sharing friends either lol .  you re lucky
i was disgusted when i noticed the food on the table
what kind of food?
it was brussel sprouts and liver
oh _comma_  disgusting . 
i have a lab mix and he is so well behaved and listens to commands so well .  i m glad i got him as a puppy . 
did you start training him when he was young?
oh yea .  basically started the day we got him .  that definitely helped . 
that s awesome .  i love a well trained dog . 
yes .  i couldnt  handle a dog i have to keep shut up when people come over and stuff . 
i know lots of bad dog parents .  i ve got a well trained dog too so _comma_  i understand . 
my friend just recently moved to california . it makes me sad because i have always wanted to live there . 
oh thats good for your friend _comma_  but it sounds like you really would like to live there! i can imagine feeling jealous
yeah . i really am .  i ve wanted to live there since i was a little girl .  someday i will!
you will get there! i would just be happy and supportive of your friend and visit often!
when i was planning my wedding _comma_  the caterer we were trying to go with kept blowing us off and dodging communication . 
oh no _comma_  did you find a backup caterer
yeah  _comma_   we dropped them with enough time to find someone else  _comma_   but it was unnecessary stress we didn t need . 
of course _comma_  the wedding can be the most stressful event of your life
it is so frustrating having to deal with difficult customers that don t want to pay their bills 
i like to call them deadbeats
normally i would agree .  it only seems to be a few here and there .  most of the time i dont have problems . 
what do you collect for ? credit cards or utilities ?
we are a retail outfit .  so we have some big customers that pay on established terms . 
i m going overseas in   weeks! i will be on vacaion for   months and i just can not  
oh i just did that recently .  i just got back from   months .  it will be a fantastic time . 
where did you go?
i went to thailand and vietnam .  dont worry about anything .  traveling was so easy and people are nice everywhere . 
i just about had a figurative heart attack the other night . 
what happened?
i woke up in the wee hours and thought i saw a person standing in the corner of my room .   it was just some clothes hanging on a door . 
oh wow _comma_  i would of been terrified!
i m very annoyed because my friend didn t give me my money back
was it a large amount?
yes! it was to cover his rent and he was supposed to pay me back
that s rough .  i m sorry that must put you in a real bind . 
i typically procrastinate when needing to pack for a trip .  but this time i got my butt in gear and it s all done several days early . 
congradulations on being prepared . 
thanks .  i usually get somewhere and realize i forgot a bunch of stuff i need cause i packed in a rush    minutes before leaving . 
it reallyi s the best way to do things .  that way even if you forget something you ve got time to remember and remedy the situation
fortunately _comma_  my wife usually comes to the rescue on me . 
haha _comma_  sometimes wifes are nice to have around . 
my wife was working yesterday _comma_  but she ended up taking the rest of the day off to spend time with me! i was shocked . 
that sounds lovely .  did yall make it a special day to remember?
we did! we went out for lunch and hung out on the beach .  it was very relaxing and a nice change . 
that sounds fantastic .  im sure you guys will remember that day for a while .  what a nice surprise . 
i went to a restaurant my wife really likes with some friends while she was at work .   it s not a big thing _comma_  but i felt a little bad about it :p
why you should feel bad .  i am not getting you my friend
not like really bad  _comma_   just kind of bad that i went somewhere my wife likes when she couldn t go .   it s not a big deal  _comma_   but i feel bad when i do things like that . 
oh .  you must be sweet then .  your wife is lucky
that horror movie made me terrified
what movie was it ?
scream
the worst a movie has gotten me was event horizon . 
i really want to have another baby .  baby fever is real lol i don t want to be all crazy about it _comma_  don t wanna track ovulation and do all this but i really wanna get pregnant asap
wow lol i didn t know you can track ovulation .  good luck with getting pregannt
thank you :) oh yeah   _comma_    you can track ovulation   _comma_    measure basal body temperature   _comma_    etc .  i m not gonna go into details
please don t lol i m a man _comma_  i appreciate what you women go through when you re pregnant or on your period but i m okay with not knowing details
my mom bought be a book online .   it should be here today i m just waiting on the delivery man . 
its the worse having to wait for something you really want .  
yes it is .   she wanted two options so i wouldn t know which she d pick .   she picked the right one so now it s just a waiting game . 
oh nice .  make a nice lunch to keep yourself busy .  the delivery will be there in no time if you keep yourself busy . 
it is nice to have in laws that are accepting and loving .  so many people don t have a good relationship with their in laws . 
yes i agree .  i did have a good relationship with my m other in law but recently it changed . 
aw i m sorry .  mine is only a few years old but it s been smooth sailing so far . 
mine has been around   years and it s been a little rocky . 
i have been trying to get my oldest son to be more responsible .   i started out small by asking him to adopt a good sleep schedule .   after several weeks he still hasn t . 
oh no .  is he responsible with school or a job?
he does well enough in school .   i think that might make him think he doesn t need any disciple in everyday life .   make me worry a bit . 
i understand _comma_  he will learn though once he gets a job and has to pay bills that he will want to go to sleep at a decent time!
my wife usually sniffs out anything going on _comma_  but i was able to successfully plan a surprise party for her without her knowing . 
did you have a bunch of people show up there at the party?
yes .  friends   _comma_    family   _comma_    cake   _comma_    all of it .  even one friend from out of town she hasnt seen in years . 
that s a great job! well done!
thank you .  probably wont be able to do it again _comma_  but happy it worked this time . 
i am so grateful for my wife
yeah  _comma_   she seems like a great woman  _comma_   you re lucky to have her . 
she really is! i couldn t be where i am without her
you should take her on a vacation _comma_  or something .  she deserves it . 
i can handle     _comma_      bees     _comma_      scorpions     _comma_      wasps     _comma_      crickets     _comma_      and spiders .   but for some reason i lose my mind around roaches . 
at least you can handle those .  i can t do any of those
i take some conselation in that _comma_  however my kids laugh when they hear thier dad scream like a girl at a flying roach . 
well _comma_  they would probably be the same if they were in your shoes
i feel guilty because i couldn t go to my friends party
understandable .   what was the reason?
i was working and i couldn t leave early
did you explain it to them .   that s a pretty good reason to miss it . 
as a momma s boy i always missed my mom anytime she was gone for an extended period of time . 
sure _comma_  that makes sense . 
fortunately  _comma_   she rarely was gone for long periods of time  _comma_   but i always dreaded this once a year work training she had to do . 
how s your relationship now ?
oh it s great . 
i am so excited about going to the movies
oh cool! what movie are you going to see?
i m going to see the purge .  i have been waiting to see it for a while
oh awesome! it s a new one?
i saw a homeless lady and i felt so bad for her because it was so hot outside so went to five guys and bought her some food and cold drinks
that s extremely sweet of you! you re a nice person .  my wife and i made some blessing bags and we give them everytime we see homeless people
blessing bags?? what are those?
basically it s a bag with necessities .  we put some water   _comma_    some non perishable foods   _comma_    snacks   _comma_    some wipes and a little bit of money
wow that s a great idea! i will do the same! thanks for sharing
the other day i framed the puzzle we used as a guest book at our wedding . 
what a great idea _comma_  where did that come from?
etsy somewhere .   my wife bought it  _comma_   so i don t really know which one  _comma_   but you can find a bunch on there . 
well i need to keep that in mind _comma_  great suggestion 
well  _comma_   what a trip that was .  i just drove from northern california to florida .  i just knew there would be no problems  _comma_   and i was right . 
oh wow _comma_  what a long trip .  how long did it take?
six days in all _comma_  but i wasn t rushing it .  i wanted to see a bit of the country .  it was amazing actually . 
that is a long time to be in the car for sure . 
it s not so bad really .  you get used to it .  if you remember to stop and stretch now and again you re ok .  and there are some decent rest areas _comma_  some with free coffee!
oh well that s a plu!
oh yes .  anything to keep the eyes open and on the road!
so where did you stop along the way?
i have big renovation plans for my house .   i ve made a money plan and have kept to it so far . 
well at least you have a plan .  are you planning to start the renovation soon?
yes _comma_  hopefully it will all go as planned .   so far so good . 
awesome .  i m sure it s going to turn out great . 
i was so anxious for my kid to graduate
i can understand that .  did it end up going ok?
it did .  i m very proud of him
that s good .  i m glad everything worked out . 
i didn t really try to use weight but i started going to the pool and i actually lost a couple of lbs
that s good to hear! good for you! maybe i should go to the pool too lol 
it s really fun and it s also a great exercise! plus water is so relaxing
true! do you just swim or you do some water aerobics?
i hope when i get older _comma_  im not lonely as i am now
i m sorry to hear that .  have you ever been married?
i was engaged but my woman left me
i m so sorry .  it wasn t meant to be . 
i recently heard in the air tonight by phil collins . 
that s such a good tune . 
yeah _comma_  for some reason it takes me back to being a kid in the    s .   no specific memory just a general feeling . 
yeah _comma_  it s definitely a classic .  it reminds me of my childhood as well . 
i got upset at my oldest son s lack of motivation .   i feel bad that i got angry with him though . 
maybe you just have to find a way to get him motivated _comma_  without showing anger . 
true .   i just haven t found a way to yet .   need to be more creative . 
yeah  _comma_   just stay positive about it  _comma_   i m sure you ll figure something out . 
k and i went to see a house a while ago .  i don t know what happened there _comma_  but when i went upstairs i became more and more nervous and eventually ran back downstairs and out the door .  scary or what . 
was it just a bad feeling you had?
it was as if something was telling me to get out .  k had the same feeling in the basement .  i ve never had that happen before . 
maybe someone died there
could be .  it used to be a home for disabled people .  we were both terrified _comma_  but we didn t say anything until we were back in our car . 
i love streaming services but sometimes they really frustrate me . 
oh yeah _comma_  the buffering?  very annoying . 
every once in awhile i get the idea to search for a movie _comma_  and almost every time it s either not listed or requires an extra charge . 
i hear that .   sometimes the classics are impossible to find . 
my eldest niece  _comma_   who helps take care of her younger disabled sister  _comma_   graduated high school with great grades recently .  she works hard both at her studies and taking care of her sister   she deserves it . 
did you get her something special?
yes  _comma_   i got her tickets for a show in london that she s been wanting to see .  she lives in scotland  _comma_   so the journey isn t bad at all .  she s taking a friend with her . 
oh awesome _comma_  that is great!
i do hope she has a wonderful time .  it s not easy living in a family with a disabled sibling and she just takes it all in her stride . 
i want to ask this girl i m friends with out but i m nervous to to so . 
you wont know an answer if you dont ask
problem is if she says no then it would make things weird between us .   i am afraid that either way i may not be able to see her again . 
just play it safe
i really wanted to try bison meet and i went all the way to that whole foods store like    miles away and they didn t have it _comma_  what a waste of time
that sucks _comma_  after going all that way too and you didn t even get to try it .  i m sorry . 
thank you! i hope i can find it somewhere locally .  i ve heard bison meat is very lean and good
i hope you do get to try it soon .  be sure to let me know how it is!
my rottweiler passes a lot of gas in the evenings . 
that s funny . 
not so much .   it is such a thick scent and it follows you everywhere you go in the house .   i usually put him out when he starts it up . 
wonder if it has to do with his diet?
it s been a long week! my husband has been out of town and its been just me and a cranky toddler . 
will he be back soon?
i sure hope so! he s in the military so i never know when he ll get called on a mission :(
okay _comma_  i see .  that must be hard . 
i once walkd around the grocery store without knowing my fly was down . 
i think we ve all done a version of that . 
i found an empty aile a went to zip up .   just then a mom with kids comes around the corner . 
ha _comma_  that s too funny . 
it s been a hard day today _comma_  its so quiet in my house .  i hate when my husband is out of town . 
that sounds tough : (  does he get back soon?
in a few months _comma_  he is in the military so he is gone a lot :( but i know he is doing it for our family and our country!
you must be so proud of him!
my young niece  _comma_   who is disabled  _comma_   was recently rushed to hospital .  she s ok now but we were very worried for a while there . 
what was going on with her?
chest infection which  _comma_   for her  _comma_   can prove fatal .  she had to go on a special oxygen machine till the antibiotics kicked in . 
that sounds pretty serious _comma_  glad she is okay now!
it was touch and go for a few days .  my brother and family are such great carers .  wish i could be too _comma_  but they live in scotland . 
i have this cat that loves to cause issues 
what sort of issues?
like last night .  she decided that she wanted to jump on the table 
cats are always getting into things and causing destruction . 
i have tried to complete a work assigment three times now without sucuess . 
oh no _comma_  could you ask your supervisor for guidance?
doubtful .   i will try again and then try a coworker if not sucuessfull . 
sounds like you have a good plan .  i wish you the best
i couldn t go to movies to watch the greatest showman when it came out so my husband bought this movie when it came out .  he is sweet
that was very sweet .  what movie did you want to watch?
it s called the greatest showman .  it s a musical! so good!! i watched it so many times already
oh ok! the gift was a good idea so that you ca watch it as much as you want 
a few weeks ago a coworker called in sick .  i had to work twice as long as i normally would .  
so you covered him .  it was very noble from your side to act in this way
it was _comma_  but it didn t help my feelings towards that coworker .  
well _comma_  at least you did something good for that co worker and most probably he feels indebted toward you
that is true _comma_  i just hope he was really sick .  i hate it when i have to cover for people who are hungover .  
my wife has been out of the country for school for   months .   i misread the calendar and thought she was getting back a week earlier than she is . 
so you have to wait a week longer to see her again? that stinks . 
yeah .   it could be worse _comma_  but it definitely put a cloud over things for half an hour or so . 
yeah _comma_  i can imagine .  at least it s only one week!
it s been awhile since i lost my last job .   after two years of working my family and i are finally moving into a home of our own . 
great to hear that . i hope you enjoy your new life . 
after such a long time we certainly will .   i can t wait to start making the house into our home . 
i am sure you will create a beautiful house . 
our pet cat will need to be put down soon . 
oh i am so sorry to hear that .  have you had it since it was a kitten?
yes we ve had her since the begining .   she is older now and has suffered with feline aids for awhile . 
that is so sad .  i had a dog die unexpectedly and it tore me up . 
it really makes me angry to see that many homeless people on the street
yeah i understand .   are there any charities nearby that you could volunteer for?
i personally dont have time to volunteer but every friday i always make a small donation to my local charity
well that s good of you .   do you think homelessness is due to mental incapacities?
my husband shocked me the other day 
why did he do that?
he threw me a surprise party and jumped out at me scaring me half to death! 
oh my _comma_  did you have a good time?
i don t get why anyone would cheat on their other half . 
i don t understand that either .  it really makes you sick to think about .  have you experienced this?
no thankfully  i havent .  i would never do it .  have you?
no i have not .  i would never participate in that either .  my wife and i are extremely happy together . 
i was planning to view the stars last night _comma_  but it was storming .  it was supposed to be the brightest that jupiter will be in a while . 
it always seems to work out like that doesn t it?
it does! i am hoping that tonight will be clear . 
i may have to check that out as well . 
a new baby means a lot changes .   one of those is the amount of time my wife and i have together . 
yes _comma_  but they also bring about a lot of good changes as well . 
agreed .   i know it s a necessary thing but i m a little jealous of the time my wife spends with the baby . 
yes  _comma_   the first years of a baby s life  _comma_   the mother pretty much spends entirely with them .  the husband is kind of left out in the cold . 
my mom is so great! she is always there for me and her grandchildren .  i can t think of anyone that loves us as much as she does!
that is wonderful! moms are truly a gift! i miss my mom at times .  we are workcamping in the mountains of nm and my mom lives in tx . 
i m sure that s hard at times .  i ve always lived close to my mom so i can t really imagine being too far away . 
we have always moved frequently with my husbands job but my parents usually end up following us lol .  now that we are fulltime rvers _comma_  they dont follow .  i miss that sometimes .  i am glad you have your mom close! cherish those times!!
i am dreading the two hour trip to the grocery store this week . 
wow  _comma_   yes  _comma_   i always feel the same way! i would love to pass of grocery shopping to someone else . 
me too!! being so far out _comma_  it takes forever to get anywhere .  i miss civilization lol . 
i bet .  i live about    minutes from a real town _comma_  which is far enough for me . 
we are workcamping in the mountains of nm .  it takes about an hour and a half to two hours to get anywhere lol .  we havent seen new faces around here in months lol . 
im really exited to go to disneyland on vacation next summer
omg that sounds like so much fun!!!!! orlando? 
yes im staying at the hotel for the first time i am really happy
you are going to love it 
i finished a class and most of my classmates got an a! it took a lot of work . 
that s great .  takes a lot of dedication to be that prepared . 
it sure does! i am so proud of the hard work that everyone put in!
you should be _comma_  not everyone can really be that dedicated about something . 
i have the best kids in the world . 
what did they do this time?
lots of little stuff .   they love to draw me pictures  _comma_   crack jokes  _comma_   and give lots of kisses . 
well that is very nice of them to do!
my husband has been putting in so many extra hours at work 
i am sure hes doing it to take care of you guys and i am sure you are pampering him too for doing it .  
oh i am pampering the heck out of him! it got him a promotion! 
pamper him all the way up until you get some lavish vacation! loooool im joking _comma_  partially! happy for you guys tho! 
i just got laid off from my job .  i need the paycheck so this is not a good situation . 
what will you try and do?
i am going to apply for new positions .  hopefully i will get something soon . 
what is your field of work?
i work in i . t . ! thanks for asking!
i just applied for a new job! it is a job that i have always wanted . 
that is really cool i hope you get the job
thank you! have you ever applied to your dream job?
not yet but i think once i have the skill for it i will defenetly will . 
i ahte when my girlfriend goes to the club alone
that would bother me as well .  have you discussed this with her?
yeah it makes me really jelous when guys talk to her
i can understand that .  i actually broke up with a previous girlfriend over the same type of thing . 
when i worked as a hotel rep .  in spain a few years ago i was greeting guests one morning .  suddenly i saw someone i knew   it was my cousin who decided to come and visit me .  it was so unexpected!
oh that must have been so exciting and surprising! 
it really was .  i had no idea he was coming to visit .  i couldn t believe my eyes!
did you all do some fun things while he was there?
we certainly did .  where i was working was a seaside resort and there are loads of clubs _comma_  restaurants etc .  so we d go to the beach and then party at night .  brilliant fun!
my keurig just died .  this is the third coffee pot in less than a year!
well _comma_  that s a real tragedy . 
i agree! i am so disgusted right now!!! we drink a lot of coffee lol .  its a   hour drive to the closest town to get another one too .  
can you buy two next time and have one in reserve?
we travel fill time in our rv so i don t really have room to carry a back up .  i hope our next location is more accessible to civilization . 
i just had to move across country to a new job .  
wow _comma_  that must ve been hard to uproot your whole life .  are you happy about the move?
i am actually! i was so ready for it .  i basically studied moving so that everything would be easy
that s awesome! i ve been wanting to do the same actually .  i hope you have a fabulous time in your new place and new job!
one day my daughter got off the bus and was crying .  an older boy intentionally tripped her as she got off the bus and she got hurt .  this made me very upset and mad!
what was the boy kid s problem?
he just thought it would be funny! he was also several years older than her and a teenager .  too old to know better!
maybe he has the crush on her?
we recently found out that our    year old son has a rare _comma_  degenerative neurological disease . 
im so sorry to hear that .  is there treatment or a cure?
no _comma_  the doctors tell us there is no cure .  they are trying to treat the symptoms but thus far its been unsuccessful . 
that sounds awful .  how is he feeling?
thank you _comma_  its been scary .  he has good days and bad .  
the door bell rang last month .  i wasn t expecting anyone _comma_  but it was my daughter and her family from way up north . 
sounds like a nice surprise! my god how beautiful .  
i couldn t believe it .  it had been almost a year since i saw them and she never even gave me a hint they were coming .  
thats seriously one of the best presents ever .  im happy for you! 
i ve studied hard all night in order to make myself ready for tomorrow s test
your hard work should pay off! any strategies?
repititions and exposure are my strategies .   sumer semesters really ramp things up . 
summer semesters are difficult .  i did them too .  best of luck to you!
going through an unused drawer i found old drawing from when my kids were little
brought back a lot of memories i guess ?
while the actual incidents of each drawing are lost in time it did make me think back to when they were younger . 
always nice to have memories of the good old days . 
i just had my husband remind me of when i fainted when he proposed!
wow  _comma_   what an awesome proposal that must ve been .  and maybe a little embarrassing  _comma_   lol . 
i was so happy when i saw him get down on one knee that i just blacked out lmao
haha _comma_  sounds very sweet though .  
the news announced a tornado warning .  i ignored it at first _comma_  but then the city tornado siren went off . 
oh no _comma_  what are you going to do?
i almost panicked as the winds started to gust _comma_  but thankfully it missed us .  a few miles up the road weren t so lucky though .  always listen to those warnings
i never listen to those warnings either _comma_  but now i ll have second thoughts . 
i got a new puppy for my birthday! she is a cutie!
congratulations! what did you name her?
i named her dixie! she is a little basset hound . 
congratulations! what did you name her?
i named her dixie! she is a little basset hound . 
how sweet! does she know any good tricks?
my neighbor ran into my car! they didn t even leave a note!
what?  that s awful!  how did you find out it was them? did someone see it?
i could tell by the color of the paint left on my car _comma_  and their car now has a scrape with the color of my car .  i don t know what to do . 
oh boy .   i would confront them kindly and tell them you d like to reach a solution without there being a fight or problem .   those situations are never fun .  sorry . 
a thunderstorm raged all of last night! it kept me awake all night!
thunder always keeps me up _comma_  it gets so loud sometimes! and the wind!
it is quite frightening! i wish that i could overcome my fear . 
yes _comma_  i could understand how it could be very fearful .  it s quite scary to be woken up that way as well . 
i just applied for graduate school! i feel good about my chances!
i m so proud of you! i ll pray for your success! 
thank you! i am very excited! it is quite unsettling though . 
it s got to be so exciting though! 
i remember just taking a deep breath the other day in the garden and just feeling happy
that sounds lovely .  do you have many flowers?
i have a garden so fully packed that i can t see my neighbors at all! 
that is quite impressive! you must be very proud of your work!
my neighbor really helped me out recently after a big windstorm . 
that was very kind of them .  did they charge you for their labor?
no  _comma_   they generously helped me clean up my yard and cut up a tree with their chainsaw  _comma_   and they asked for nothing in return . 
that sounds like a good neighbor .  i hope that your home was not damaged . 
my son just graduated from high school! he has worked so hard _comma_  and he even earned a scholarship . 
congratulations to you both!  what s he going to study in college?
thank you! he is going to study computer science!
that s a great degree for the future and getting a job .   good luck to him . 
i am taking a trip to disney world next month! my wife is going for the first time!
that s so awesome  _comma_   i m really jealous! i ve never been either  _comma_   and i m actually saving up for a trip!
i have been a couple of times before _comma_  and it is such a magical place! where are you planning on taking a trip to?
disney world too _comma_  i ve always wanted to go! i hope you guys have a wonderful time!
i slipped and fell in the restroom last week .  the floors desperately needed cleaned . 
i m sorry i hope you didn t get injured
the only thing to get injured was my pride .  it was quite the gross experience . 
lol i can imagine
the other day comcast customer service kept me waiting for    minutes just to speak with someone .  what a disgrace!
they are such a bad company
they re awful .  if they d just employ enough cs people to handle the volume you could just about bear it!
oh yea exactly
mind you  _comma_   their product is useless too .  ok  _comma_   rant over!
queue jumping is something which irks me no end .  i was at the deli counter of my local store recently and some guy came up and started ordering .  the employee served him _comma_  too . 
it s quite disheartening to know people jump queues
yes .  and i m disabled and it s hard to stand for a long time while some idiot gets his lunch .  i hope it was horrible!
i believe he will pay somehow .  they call it karma :)
perhaps salmonella poisoning? one can only hope _comma_  lol!
i am very glad we headed the warnings and evacuated prior to hurricane harvey . 
that must have been scary .   it s always better to be safe in a situation like that .   
yes it was a scary time .  we stocked up on food and bottled water and moved our rv about an hour and a half inland .  luckily the storn went to the north of us . 
it s great that you had an rv to stock and pack more things .   glad to hear the storm missed you!
our rv is our home _comma_  we are full time rvers! thank you so much! have you ever been through an evactuation? did you feel prepared?
this past mother s day my husband gave me some wonderful unexpected gifts! he even got me a gorgeous diamond ring . 
wow you are lucky to have someone so thoughtful .  i bet you were feeling great . 
i was! it was so thoughtful and sweet _comma_  and i was very touched by it . 
that is awesome .  i am sure you will return the favor one day . 
my parents are going to a tea room for their anniversary .   
did you plan the anniversary?
no that is where they decided to go but the thing is i called the place and they can t accommodate my special diet i am on .   i am so sad b c that means i can t go with the . 
well _comma_  hopefully they still have a good time . 
i am very excited for the arrival of our  th grandbaby!
oh that s great .  you must be the luckiest granddad in the whole world
thank you _comma_  i try to be the best nana i can be .  we are hoping she comes while we are visiting for christmas!
all the best buddy enjoy the celebrations :)
thank you so much! i surely will . 
my dad has early onset dementia
im sorry to hear that _comma_  its very hard to cope with
yes _comma_  i try my hardest to be caring and patient with him b c i know he doesn t mean to be harsh or hard to deal with at times . 
it is _comma_  i feel for you! i had a relative that progressively got worse and its extremely difficult  
at work today _comma_  all my coworkers sang me happy birthday .  it was so nice of them!
that s awesome! i love when people remember my birthday . 
it was so thoughtful of them .  i didn t even mention it was my birthday .  
how fun! i wonder how they knew . 
i don t know .  but they sure wen t above and beyond!
i took a huge test today and man it made me so nervous .  i really hope i did well on it .  
did you study hard?
i did _comma_  i studied every day for week! i almost wore myself out studying .  
then i am sure you will do well . 
i really hope so _comma_  i am so nervous while i wait for my results .  
i am so proud of my son
what did he do?
he got the highest score on a test
that is impressive! i hope he is proud too!
my husband usually gets a big bonus around this time of the year .  we are eagerly waiting  _comma_   hoping  _comma_   and waiting for it!
oh that is awesome! its so nice to get money in a lumpsum
it is! it s not a guarantee though  _comma_   so it s just a waiting game  _comma_   and not easy . 
that makes it very difficult _comma_  and hard not to get your hopes up
i am so angry that my brother didnt come to my party
oh wow! i would be very angry as well! unless it was some kind of emergency or extenuating circumstance
i am not sure .  i just don t know why he didn t show
he didn t even call to let you know whats going on?
i am confident that i will have a great day tomorrow
that is a great mindset to have _comma_  and should lead to a great day!
that is so true .  getting to know you also makes it seem like a great day already leading to tomorrow . 
that is a very kind thing to say! i appreciate that
i have trusting issues because my fiance left  me
that is sad to hear .  don t worry _comma_  you will find someone that is for you . 
i know but it s so hard because no one wants to be with me
it seems like that but it is not true .  you have to be patient and you will find your love one day . 
flying typically doesn t bother me too much _comma_  because i love travel .  however i was a bit concerned on a flight once right after a travel advisory had been issued . 
i would have been terrified _comma_  like need a nice strong drink type of terrified! how did it end up going?
well i did have a few of those .  it went fine .  i was still nervous even after we landed in a foreign country .  i just watched my surroundings .  everything went great . 
im glad it all went well! it seems that sometimes when you are extremely nervous it can make time pass quickly too .  
i am so lonely right now because no one wants to be with me
i m sad to hear that .  have you tried using social media to make new friends?
yeah _comma_  but no luck
try going to the park then .  you could run into someone that is into you . 
when i was younger i was really getting into graphic design and really wanted a new apple computer .  i knew my parents couldnt afford it _comma_  but they somehow made it happen and surprised me on christmas . 
that is awesome! parents are the best
yea my parents are pretty great .  pretty maddening at times _comma_  but i wouldn t trade them . 
lol i know the feeling! and being a parent i now understnd
i hope to be there one day and see it from that side . 
i felt really good when i won a poker tournament last week
awesome! was it hold em?
yes it was _comma_  it took a long time to do but at the end it was worth it
most def _comma_  i love playing hold em
spiders is one of my gratest fear they make me so scared
i also do not like spiders .  i don t even like watching spiderman due to not liking spiders . 
i have tried to overcome my fear but i just cant they make my skin temble
maybe you can go see a doctor and he can help you with your fear . 
i am impressed that video games grow so much every year
the only video game i have ever played is super mario . 
that is a great game the growth on video games has been amazing this past few years
it is a classic _comma_  even my kids enjoy playing it . 
we went out to dinner for our first anniversary and they got our order all wrong . 
thats always terrible _comma_  but congrats on the anniversary!
thank you .  the restaurant came highly rated by a lot of people so i guess my expectations were high .  i tried not to let it bother me . 
that makes the situation worse when your expectations are through the roof
my wife flew home to see family .  it is very quite at home now . 
i definitely relate to that feeling _comma_  why can t they take us with them!?
i know _comma_  that would of been nice! instead i was all alone for the last few weeks .  
well   _comma_    i hope she gets home soon   _comma_    to make the home   _comma_    a home again! :)
me too _comma_  a home doesn t feel like a home without a woman .  
i am really impressed everytime i see my nephew on how fast he is growing
it is pretty crazy how fast grow up when you get older _comma_  it seems like a couple of weeks and they are in high school
yeah but i dont see him very often maybe that is why i always get shocked when i see him
that s definitely a factor _comma_  sometimes i forget about some of my nephews even exist . 
when i got the phone call that my mom had cancer i was so upset . 
i am so sorry to hear that .  no one should have to go through something like that . 
it s hard watching one of your parents get sick .  we were at the movie theater when i found out and i had to leave . 
i m sure i would have done the same thing! but stay strong _comma_  many people have beaten cancer! keep a positive attitude and stay by her side!
one of the best days of my life was when i graduated from high school
that was an awesome day for me too _comma_  hard to believe it was nearly     years ago
i know right time goes really fast and you dont even noticed _comma_  for me it was    years ago
agreed! its a shame growing up how fast you wanted to be an adult
the other night i was driving home in the rain and slid into the guard rail .  it is going to cost so much to get my car fixed!
oh man _comma_  now that sucks! you gotta be careful on those wet roads .  at least you re okay . 
i know  _comma_   i will have to be more careful next time .  i shouldn t eat ice cream while driving  _comma_   
is your car still drivable?
it will still move _comma_  but i can t steer very well with the front tires missing .  
there is a tornado coming .  but i have the pantry full and am ready this time . 
good thinking .   you can never be too prepared _comma_  only under prepared . 
you never know how long the power might be out for! 
yep! or if you re house will be hit .   many possibilities with tornadoes!
it could take a while for any sort of rescue to come! 
i had a pretty large loan   _comma_    with a bit of a high interest rate   _comma_    and a high monthly payment .  my mother decided to pay it off for me   _comma_    out of the blue!
oh my goodness .  what a blessing
yes  _comma_   i couldn t believe it .  she s so sweet and giving  _comma_   but i sure didn t expect her to do that!
it much be a huge weight off of your shoulder
my husband is the most faithful man i know
that is great to hear! a faithful spouse is a blessing
i have so many health problems and he is always there for many no matter what being loving and caring
i am sorry to hear about that! i hope everything gets better for you!
i left the front door unlocked and the mailman robbed me .  i couldn t believe i would do that . 
oh no _comma_  i hope you did any sustain any injury
only my pride! i wasn t at home when he robbed me .  he took a lot of valuables .  
yea _comma_  he will definitely get caught
i hope so! a federal worker like that should have more integrity! 
i have always been afraid of snakes i dont know what to do to control my fear for them
that makes two of us! i am terrified of all snakes
yes _comma_  i one time i was taking a hike and   meters to my left was a rattle snake i jumped like a rabbit and ran back to my friends
eww thats disgusting _comma_  and makes it worse it was a poisonous snake
i was annoyed when my wife left me
ah that s terrible .  i would be annoyed as well i think . 
yeah its been a rough   weeks for me
i m sorry to here that _comma_  but life goes on and tomorrow is another day .  we just have to make the best with what we are given .  you ll get through this . 
i was afraid when i went into the movies alone
really why is that?
because i have always been with someone _comma_  so going in alone just frightened me
i think with time you will get used to it . 
i ve been married almost    years .  my husband travel so much _comma_  but we both have trust in each other to be true and loyal . 
that is great _comma_  why does he travel so much?
for his job .  so  _comma_   it can be hard  _comma_   but we trust each other . 
what does he do for his job?
i am hopeful that my friend will be able to make it to my party
thats good _comma_  is it very important that this friend be there?
it is to me because he is my best friend
that makes sense! im sure he will be there for you!
i have been exercising and taking care of myself more lately . 
there you go! i need to work on that area of my life as well . 
i think many do _comma_  but man does it feel good . 
i bet you have more energy and more confidence for sure!
i am joyful that i am with my wife
how you been together long?
we have been together for    years
awesome .  i ve got you beat by   year .  you know i just read the average couple from the time to meet to the time the ends things is   years .  if you make it past that it will probably last for every .  
i felt pretty luck the other day! i won      on a scratch off ticket! i never win!
you are pretty lucky!
not usually  _comma_   i never win .  so  _comma_   it was very unexpected . 
maybe i should buy some .  i never win either .  its about time
my sister was given    _comma_     by my grandma as a graduation present .  she did not give me a penny . 
i am sorry _comma_  maybe she will share?
perhaps _comma_  i just don t understand why i was left out .  seems unfair . 
that is infair
we went on our vacation about a week ago to the beach and it rained several days while we were there .  we wanted to go to the beach every day!
i hate when that happens! especially when you have been waiting for the beach!
yes   _comma_    and when you pay a fortune to get beachfront! but   _comma_    we still had a good time   _comma_    just wished we could have had less rain!
that s what matters most _comma_  that you had a good time and made memories!
i was given the opportunity to work at a new job that i was hoping to get! i never thought it would be possible!
congratulations! i m sure you earned it!
thank you! i feel very fortunate to have been given the opportunity . 
you re welcome .  i wish you the best in the new position . 
i fell down in a mud puddle today while walking to lunch .  i was covered in mud for the rest of the work day . 
oh no! that is awful _comma_  that can mess with your mood . 
no kidding! it was hard to keep a good attitude for the rest of the day . 
i can understand that!
my husband works nights a lot right now . 
i bet that is a rough schedule . 
it really is _comma_  i hate being alone at night . 
does he get any nights off?
a few  _comma_   but he still has to sleep all day  _comma_   makes doing things hard . 
i m anxious (if excited!) about an upcoming move    we ve lived overseas before  _comma_   but this is such a different state and climate  _comma_   i m not sure what to expect!
it sounds like a great chance to start over fresh! where are you moving to?
alaska! we ve got some transition time  _comma_   but i ve been doing deep research on anchorage    and the more i see  _comma_   the more i like!
oh wow! how exciting! i can t wait to come visit you there so you can show me the sights!
i hate that people hit on others they know are married . 
ugh _comma_  why do people do that? it s annoying . 
right? happens to my husband all the time and it s just frustrating . 
do you smack the women who do it?
no _comma_  since it s his associates at work!!
i cannot wait for the next star wars movie to come out
yeah _comma_  they are so good! george lucas is a genius! 
he is _comma_  i really like the new ones but always will like the old ones better
yeah me too .  i prefer the first three .  they are very different from the others .  
i hate when i fart in public it is so embarrasing
you re unable to hold them in?
i can hold them but some of them are just accidental and it is the worst _comma_  depends on what i eat haha
i m sorry _comma_  that must be pretty rough on you!
my husband recently got me a great gift .  he got me a beautiful    kt diamond ring! i had no idea he was . 
wow that is awesome
yes _comma_  it was so sweet and unexpected .  we ve been married almost    years so i guess i deserve it lol
that is a long time
i hate that people dont care and they just throw their trash on the street
do you pick up after them or tell them anything?
if im walking i pick up as much as i can
thats good of you
i am extremely afraid of going near hiights
oh i can relate i am also afraid of that
yeah last year i went to disneyland and got on the elevator game and i almost cried hahaha
haha  .  i remember a time i was in vegas i was scared to go on this really high ride
the last job interview i went on also went well _comma_  but it took a long time to hear back from them . 
i hope you get that call soon!
oh  _comma_   i did eventually  _comma_   it just took like a month .   i ended up getting the job!
wow thats great _comma_  congrats!
i cant wait for my disneyland vacation next summer
oh nice _comma_  how long are you going for ?
i think me and my family is going there for   week it is going to be wonderfull
that sounds like a great time . 
i am getting my new car next week and cant wait for it . 
i understand that! what kind of car is it?
it is a      bmw _comma_  i traded in my old car to get an awesome deal
thats pretty fancy! does it have all the bells and whistles?
my in laws are helping us pay for school clothes for our kids this year . 
that is great! i know my sister has had help with that a lot too! it can get expensive .  you know they have new clothes from target at goodwill a lot _comma_  that helps with spending 
yeah _comma_  it helps take some of the burden off of us .  i will have to check out goodwill and see if i can find anything . 
it s like    for new clothes _comma_  good quality a lot .  great! yes it is a lot to buy clothes for ever growing kids
wow    _comma_     those prices are great .  i ll be going by there for sure .  yeah    _comma_     the best part about them helping    _comma_     is that they do it    _comma_     not expecting anything in return .  they just all of us and want to help . 
that is the spirit of a true giver and the only one i would take a gift from! great in laws!
yes _comma_  they are great . 
i was in a college class once with an older woman .   she took a paper idea i had talked about and presented it as her own _comma_  stealing all the work i had done . 
that is despicable .  did you report her to the teacher?
i did .   there wasn t much she could do _comma_  but at least i could still do the same paper without having to redo a bunch of work . 
she could drop her from the class and give her an f!
i really hate when people make me wait for no reason
me too! who did this to you?
my girlfriend allways makes me wait _comma_  it makes me really anxious ahhahah
i understand that! when i am ready to go  i just want to hurry up and go .  i hate sitting around waiting too .  maybe you should make her wait and see if she likes it .  lesson 
one of my best friends is moving far away and i dont know when i will be able to see him again
that s so sad! can you email them?
yeah i can call him and email him _comma_  it is just that i dont know when we will see eachother again
can you see him before he goes?
i think having goals is important .  my mother in law has managed to lose weight and walked daily . 
hey _comma_  that s pretty good .  do you have any goals set for yourself?
very similar ones _comma_  but i like focusing on others success
well i hope yours work out as well .  focusing on the goals of others probably gives you a lot of inspiration . 
it really does _comma_  hope any you have works out!
i hate to see people mistreating animals i cant stand it
oh i know! i could kill people like that . 
i know right _comma_  it is really sad some people cant understand they suffer as well as you and me
and they don t have a voice of their own . 
the day i gratuaded from college is my favorite day
congratulations! what made it so great?
the fact that it took so much work and time
ah _comma_  well you earned it!
i cant wait for my new tv that i ordered online and will recive this weekend
oh .  congrats .  you must be happy then
yeah it is twice the size as the tv that i have at the moment
wow then .  do you have any special plans to celebrate ?
i have an older friend who i try to help out .   she lost her husband a couple years ago .  
thats very admirable of you .   how do you help her?
we go out to lunch regularly .   she is depressed and i try and get her out of the house to do things . 
we need more people like you in the world .   theres always someone out there who needs a helping hand and could use a friend . 
thanks .   yes she had some mental issues around the time he died but is doing better now . 
we need to come together as a country and be united and solve our issues _comma_  no matter your views . 
i totally agree .  people are too divided by their political views these days . 
exactly _comma_  let s comprimise and decide on things before it s to late!
everyone is always fighting over these things _comma_  it s a sad thing to see . 
i spent my first christmas away from home in a computer lab _comma_  working by myself . 
oh! pity about you .  
yes _comma_  it wasn t very fun .   but i had to do it because my project for work was due the next day . 
hope you had good time after your work!
i miss my dog kat
 i am so sorry to hear that . 
yes she was a wonderful black lab who died last year .   she was a great dog
i hope you find a new puppy love soon . 
thanks .   i do miss coming home to her .   my cat is just not the same . 
it s great to see my husband doing so well . 
i am glad to hear that!  what is happening with him?
he s become the top manager in his division in just two years . 
that is awesome!  i hope he got a good raise
hello _comma_  i am very upset about the abuse of some people with their pets  .  it is unacceptable
i can t imagine why people would do that .  animals are helpless . 
i feel that pain  .  as if i had been hit
you re very empathetic then! i hate seeing animals suffer as well . 
it s something since i was born  .  i m like that
that reminds me of the time i went to la for vacation with my family .  i wanted to meet people so i went hiking in the mountains but it soon became dark .  
hiking is probably a tough environment to meet people! la is real nice _comma_  but i hear the people there aren t 
yea it probably wasn t the smartest decision but at the end i meat a nice group .  they eventually helped me from that situation also .  
that s cool! did you end up keeping up with them after you left?
i really miss my puppy _comma_  we got her a statue for the backyard to remember her always . 
thats sweet to have such a memory of her .  did she pass away then? 
yes _comma_  she was very old .  it was a great tribute to her life . 
im so sorry _comma_  pets are like children 
my son is teething and he is so cranky! i gave him tylenol and got some teething toys .  i don
teething is a hard period for babies and moms
it is! his molars are coming so he is inconsolable! doesn t sleep good _comma_  doesn t want to eat .  poor little boy
poor baby .  i remember my kids teething too .  it was horrible
i was trying to sleep train my son but i failed .  i didn t it s gonna be that hard .  i think we will be co sleeping till he goes to college
ha ha _comma_  i m sure he ll get the the hang of it eventually .  it takes some children longer than others to get used to . 
i hope so _comma_  i miss sleeping in a comfortable position without baby feet in my face
i m not looking forward to it when i have a kid! i can t function without a good   hours of sleep . 
i have been seeing pictures of friends of mine traveling around italy . 
how does that make you feel ?
i wish i were with them .   i love italy
i ve never left the us .  i ve never been north of kentucky . 
oh wow!  you are missing out .   i love traveling and seeing the world . 
i ve spent my life turning my home into where i want to be _comma_  instead of where i want to leave . 
that is true but there is something to be said about seeing other cultures
my friend bought me lunch today
that was nice .  what did you have?
i had a nice burger and fries
that sounds good .  i bet it was fun to hangout and eat with your friend . 
yes i was appreciative that she wanted to buy me lunch
i hate when people pull in front of you _comma_  especially when it s clear behidn you . 
it is very annoying! i hate it too
had to slam my brakes .  i don t get people at all . 
some people should not be allowed to drive! we were rear ended   times last months! can you believe that
yes _comma_  sadly i easily can . 
i know i m an adult but i m very scared of the dark .  i have a good imagination so i always see something creepy
that;s ok _comma_  everyone has some kinda fears that make little sense to others . 
that s why i can t sleep alone or if i m alone i always keep the light on
hey _comma_  i can t sleep without socks .  it s no big deal . 
i like to help at the animal shelter walking the dogs .  they get a chance to get out of their cages and be with a nice human like me . 
that is really nice of you! i am sure they appreciate it
they do .  they get to smell the grass   _comma_    they play they get their exercise   _comma_    they get to have fun   _comma_    they get to be a dog! 
they get to enjoy themselves and have a good time! :)
last night at like midnight the power cut out completely on my street
oh no _comma_  did you have candles and flashlights available?
we luckily had candles around! i was so worried cause it was so fast it was like someone cut our power
good thing _comma_  you have to be prepared for those situations
a while back my cat knocked over and broke my mothers urn . 
oh i am so sorry .  cats can be very mischievous sometimes .  
i was so mad for the longest time but i ve gotten around to not being so made about it
yea i feel you .  at the end of the day you cant blame the cat .  it didnt do this on purpose . 
i made a bowl of cereal for breakfast and when i started eating i realized milk was spoiled!! i started gagging .  it was so gross! 
man i m sorry to hear that . i ve wasted a good protein shake doing that once
don t you hate that? gosh _comma_  i didn t eat anything the whole day because i don t have an appetite anymore
oh well i was starving . i just rinsed it out with some mouthwash and ordered a big pizza lol
i was so calm and happy the other night just listening to rain hitting the kitchen windows 
i use to live in an older house that had a tin roof  _comma_   and i d always love hearing the rain beat on it! helped me sleep like a baby  _comma_   . 
it was the single most calming thing! i love the sound of rain on a tin roof too! 
i wonder if that s a common thing? it s very relaxing . 
i got in a car accident   months ago and now i get so anxious every time i need to drive somewhere
i m sorry for that .  have you tried going to therapy?
not yet .  i m so broke i can t even afford it .  i had to buy a new car and my premiums went up 
i m so sorry but you ll get there in time . 
though the odds are against you _comma_  i understand why people gamble .  i remember a particular time i was playing video poker at a local dive bar . 
i ve never gambled .  what happened when you were playing video poker? and is it fun?
well     _comma_      take this with a grain of salt     _comma_      but it can be a blast .  i put in    like i usually do     _comma_      and on the first deal     _comma_      i hit       .  i went nuts     _comma_      cashing out immediately and started shoving     bills in to everyone s hands and pockets!
wow _comma_  check out mr .  moneybags over here! that must have been a real thrill though . 
i honestly think new orleans is one of the most exciting places to live in the us .  you never know what you are going to find around the corner . 
yes _comma_  it does seem like a fun place .  i would love to go to the mardi gras . 
mardi gras is great   _comma_    but stuff happens every day .  one time i was showing some friends around from out of town   _comma_    and we heard some voices on the other side of a fence .  we ducked through a hole   _comma_    and found a bar with a full band playing   complete with couples swing dancing!
that sounds like a lot of fun! i wish i would have seen it!
i hate when you go out on a limb for someone and they turn around and burn you for it .  you know what i mean?
i d say that d be a real disappointment to say the least . 
you can say that again .  one time _comma_  i loaned a friend a bike to get to work and back .  a couple weeks later i heard he stopped going to work and had pawned the bike for drug money . 
end of friendship . 
i am not quite sure what you mean by that?
sorry that was sent by an mistake
that s ok _comma_  it happens to the best of us!
i don t think i am a judgmental person  _comma_   but we all have our limits .  i stayed on my girlfriend s friend s homestead for a day  _comma_   and i can still smell it . 
oh that little unfair
trust me   _comma_    this place was out of control .  they had the pig pen and the chicken coup within a stones throw of the main house .  to top it off   _comma_    they had running clean water   _comma_    but no toilet indoors! 
oh enjoy dude
i just finished working on a presentation that i m supposed to give tomorrow . 
congrats! how do you feel about it? and what is the presentation on?
i feel pretty good about it .   i ve spent the last two weeks crunching numbers about our holiday projections . 
it s good that you worked hard on it .  i hope you get a raise or a bonus for your labor!
i ll find out at christmas .   considering all the numbers i looked at _comma_  the possibility looks good! 
sometimes you know your friends better than even their long term roommates know them .  have you ever been in that situation?
i think so .   sometimes our friends show us sides of them that they rarely show other people . 
that s definitely true! i am thinking of one person in particular to be honest .  we waited all night at her house for her to join us so we could make this party .  she never showed!
did you make the party anyway?
not too long ago _comma_  my mother unexpectedly paid off a high monthly payment and interest loan! i couldn t believe it! 
wow .  that is a blessing
yes  _comma_   i didn t have a clue she was going to do it and it was very much appreciated it . she s always so great thought  _comma_   i am blessed . 
i am going to always take care of my kids like that
i broke a finger the other day and couldn t do any dishes! it was terrible 
i hate doing dishes any way
i was super lucky though because my husband just went up and did them all for me! 
that s sweet
so i managed to get all my school shopping done this week so the kids have all their things ready to go for tomorrow!
cool i just finished today
i got an early start this year .   most years i start late and they re out of stuff i need by the time i get around to it . 
yeah we had a hard time today lol
and then the stores get so crowded after a certain point!  
i am going to do like you next year for sure!
i think next year i m going to start early but just do everything online .   all the stores in town were absolute messes today!
i was having a bad day the other day and everything just kept going wrong 
that happens sometimes
the worst part of the day though was when i dropped my last cookie i was really looking forward to
i probably wouldve cried
i fought off hordes of people shopping for school stuff all at the same time and i won!  i got everything on their lists!
was it like black friday? lol
yes .    chuckle!   school starts tomorrow here and it was absolutely insane .   the worst part was  _comma_   usually i go to the store regularly before   a because there s less people in there and i can just kinda stroll through the aisles .   oh no  _comma_   not today .   it was just about elbow to elbow!
stick to your routine next time
i have to grocery shop on thursday and hopefully the furor will have died down .   but i was in the checkout line and i swore that next year _comma_  i m ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!  
i hear ya! i am definitely shopping online
especially since i was just browsing and a lot of online places have deals better than the ones in store!
plus you can usually get some kind of cash back .  i love deals
the other day i was getting a glass out the cabinet and there sat a spider 
ew _comma_  i hate spiders .  we are in the process of getting them out of our garage . 
i hate the little things too! it was in the glass at that! 
oh no _comma_  throw it away!!!!
it s not that i am adverse to avant garde theater _comma_  but this  play  i went to recently was a little too much . 
how was it too much?
well   _comma_    to their credit   _comma_    they had advertised it as being quite interactive .  a little contact is ok   _comma_    but they wanted me to eat  mystery candy  from a box while blindfolded!
that sounds very strange
around this time of the year  _comma_   my husband usually always gets a large bonus  _comma_   but it s not a promise .  it s not easy waiting to see if he will!
how big is the bonus usually?
it all depends  _comma_   but always has been thousands .  so  _comma_   the waiting drives us nuts!
wow _comma_  well i hope you guys get it this year then!
when my friend told me to give him my last       _comma_   i thought he was crazy .  but in the end  _comma_   i am glad i did . 
why did you do that?
he has these crackpot schemes but they always work out .  we turned that      in to       a piece selling posters at a music festival!
wow _comma_  good for you guys!
not all of my high school memories are fond ones .  like the time i drank too much and passed out at a party . 
how old were you?
i was about    at the time .  the thing is _comma_  i passed out right in front of the entrance to the house .  everyone coming and going had to step over me!
that is young _comma_  i wish someone had helped you!
i don t know how you are with calc _comma_  but i can get pretty anxious before an exam . 
math has never been my strong suit .  i m more of a history type of person . 
me neither! that s why i was amazed when this girl said she had made a study guide and would e mail us all a copy .  i ended up with a b!
that was very altruistic of her! 
my cat kept doing her best to wake me up last night 
why she is doing that?
she was trying to wake me up to get me to play with her! 
ah ok i undestand . 
i never thought i would be where i am today .  if you would have told me i would go back to school at    _comma_  i would have thought you were crazy . 
why did you go back?
i had always wanted to be an electrical engineer  _comma_   but had settled for life in the service industry (not knocking it) .  i re taught myself basic algebra  _comma_   and was accepted to a state university two years ago! 
good for you _comma_  best of luck!!
i was so stressed when i found out that i did not get accepted in my dream college
oh no .  did you have a good backup plan ?
yeah i got into another college that was not as good haha
maybe you can transfer after a bit ?
my boyfriend cancelled our date last week to go to the movies with his female best friend . 
how did that make you feel?
annoyed .  i feel like he chooses her over me a lot .  i hate feeling like i have to compete with her .  
i understand! i would feel the same way . 
i cant believe the growth video games are having this past couple of years
what do you mean by that? i m not a gamer really
gaming has blown up this past couple of years 
oh you re right _comma_  it has .  i hear about it more and more
i love roller coasters _comma_  but i hate that my favorite amusement parks close during the winter .  
i hate that most parks close during the winter too .  do you have any indoor type amusement parks near you?
not that i m aware of .  :( when february rolls around _comma_  all i can think about is how much i miss them and how i can t wait to go back . 
i feel you .  you will just have to go as often as possible during the other months to make up for the winter time without!
i m excited to graduate college and start my career soon! i have a feeling that my life will get much better once i do . 
ooh _comma_  congratulations! i ll be graduating soon too .  what s your major?
i m an engineering major _comma_  electrical engineering specifically .  and yourself?
that s very cool .  my dad s an electrical engineer _comma_  actually .  i m a cybersecurity major myself . 
i really am thankful for everything that i have and had
what is your most prized posession?
it is actually a little medal my dad gave me when i was little
why is that?
he gave it to me beafore he went to the army _comma_  and when he came back i showed it to him and it was really emotional
my little brother has gotten really good at bowling recently and it kind of floors me!
oh wow _comma_  maybe he can get a scholarship! i know some colleges now offer bowling athletic programs . 
perhaps! he s joining the high school bowling team so that may help his chances as well .  do you like to bowl yourself?
you must be very proud of him! yes _comma_  i love to bowl with my family but i m not very good at it!
i keep hearing strange noises in my house .  my husband is out of town and i m all alone .  there has been reports of break ins on my street . 
that is scary .  do you have means of defending yourself?\
no i don t _comma_  i do have two dogs! they keep growling at the noises to!
maybe you can call a neighbor or something to see if they see anything suspicious outside your house! don t hesitate to call the police if you feel you should!
so i suck hard at bowling _comma_  but tonight i tried to be pro and putting spin on the ball .  i ended up just throwing it down the lane instead . 
ha ha! i have done that _comma_  too .  so embarrassing . 
yeah _comma_  my face was bright red when the ball almost went into the other lane! thankfully there was somebody that sucked even worse than me in my party . 
phew _comma_  so they got most of the attention . 
i have a very good friend and her boyfriend made sexual advances towards me .  i never did tell my friend  _comma_   for various reasons  _comma_   but i feel really guilty and bad about  
it can be hard in those situation i know you don t want to loose a friend in the end . 
yes   _comma_    and there were financial and personal reasons of her own that is why i didn t tell her .  plus   _comma_    i really hated to hurt her   _comma_    but i guess i should have told her . 
yes you should but when you feel comfortable don t feel guilty you are the victim he is a sad case you got this . 
i still live and work in the place where i grew up _comma_  but all of my friends have moved away . 
aw _comma_  that has to be tough not to see your friends .  do they visit often?
no   _comma_    everyone s so busy with their lives and work that it s hard to arrange .  most of the people here my age do drugs or stay out all night   _comma_    so i keep to myself at home   _comma_    alone . 
how awful! you re much better off staying at home .  i hope you find new friends soon!
so college is starting up soon and i m worried i won t be able to deal with the workload again . 
school can be tough .  how many credits are you taking on?
i wanna say    credit hours for engineering classes .  i have a part time job too i work    hours a week at . 
engineering is already tough .  if you can get through this _comma_  i d say you ll be very successful in life . 
so college is starting up soon and i feel more ready than ever to do well this year!
oh you re gonna be awesome i bet!
thanks _comma_  i m going to try! last semester wasn t bad but i procrastinated more than i should have . 
yeah that always happens _comma_  don t be hard on yourself as long you do great
so i just had an amazing dinner and am now relaxing in my room .  i feel very at ease . 
nice .  what was dinner?
surprisingly enough _comma_  a pizza from the bowling alley .  i never said that i was picky!
i haven t met a pizza i didn t like yet . 
my son is teething really bad and he is so inconsolable that breaks my heart .  i can t wait till these molars cut thru
i remember my kids going through that .  do you have teething rings for him?
i do but he doesn t like them .  he can barely eat his mouth hurts so bad
poor boy .  i hope he gets through it soon . 
i think i will be very busy monday night playing my new game . 
what is the game about you must love games it will take up your whole night . 
world of warcraft .  i v got a deeper reason then it being a game  it s how i meet my husband . 
really that is a cool story to tell when asked how you   met did ya ll play online together a lot?
i come home from work and my parents always seem to be arguing .  it s very frustrating . 
oh that s not good .  do they argue about small things?
yes they do .  they act like children and i am essentially the most mature responsible one in the house . 
yikes _comma_  that shouldn t be .  i think you ve really stepped up in this situation .  hopefully they can see that and change their ways . 
i think storms are wonderful _comma_  except when the power goes out . 
i love storms too but yeah _comma_  that s a nuisance . 
it was extra loud and my husband was at work _comma_  bit scary . 
yikes! lightning didn t strike real close by _comma_  did it?
o it sure seemed like it did _comma_  dogs were scared too . 
college is starting soon and i m feeling like i ll be able to stay on top of homework this semester!
that is good .  will it be a difficult semester?
it probably will be _comma_  as i m studying engineering .  i feel confident that i won t procrastinate as much this time though!
that is good .  i am sometime a procrastinator . 
i recently heard a music artist for the first time in a long time that brought me back to my childhood . 
awww _comma_  what fun .   that must have been so nostalgic for you!  i wish i was back in childhood again sometimes . 
it sure was! i enjoy reliving the memories _comma_  things were often simpler and more carefree back then . 
i saw a toy that they are bringing back from a couple decades ago when i was a kid and wow _comma_  it was so neat to see!
so i consider myself a decent bowler but my brother came out of nowhere _comma_  he s actually really skilled .  i m kind of shocked actually . 
wow .  sibling s got skills . 
for sure .  i am here doing the traditional bowling style and he is spinning the ball across the lane getting strikes often .  he makes me look bad!
how long has he been bowling?
i am so nervous to start my new job tommorrow . 
i am sorry to hear that _comma_  i am sure you will be fine .  what kind of job is it?
it s a desk job .  its my first time in a place like this . 
well _comma_  it shouldn t be too bad .  if you couldn t do the work i m sure they wouldn t have hired you . 
so i had a customer sign the wrong form today .  i feel kind of bad because i ll have to have them sign the right thing next time and i ll look incompetent . 
that s a bummer .  at least you will be more attentive next time?
for sure  _comma_   that is a silver lining .  mistakes happen i suppose  _comma_   can t expect to be perfect!
indeed .  if everyone got worked up over things like that _comma_  we d all be out of jobs . 
so i went on a road trip to utah a few months ago after my friends backed out .  it was awesome but i did miss them . 
that sounds incredible .  did you visit the great salt lake?
no i didn t get around to that area! i did visit arches and canyonlands national parks though .  even though i was by myself _comma_  would do again!
man _comma_  i definitely have to go there .  sounds like a great place for sightseeing . 
so my brother got my dream vehicle as his first car .  i am feeling a certain way about this!
oh my god _comma_  do you think he got it just because you like it so much?
i don t think so actually _comma_  i haven t let him know that i love that type in particular so much haha .  i am definitely wishing it was mine though!
that is hilarious _comma_  in a cruel kind of way . 
so i want to buy a new vehicle but i m nervous about pulling the trigger on it . 
ohh  _comma_   i feel you .  i felt the same way  _comma_   when i was planning to buy a new car . 
yep .  like  _comma_   my current car is dying  _comma_   but i almost literally want to drive it until it no longer runs at all . 
yeah .  i believe you are emotionally attached to it!
people are crazy now a days .  i watched people try to take a gas can from my yard!
wow why would they even do that?
it was during a power outage during a hurricane _comma_   still made me mad . 
sheesh _comma_  people will take anything that s not nailed down these days . 
so my car wouldn t start today after work .  i kind of hate my car!
that s terrible to hear .  is it old?
oh yes  _comma_   very old .  it s a      and while i ve had it for   years now  _comma_   i m finally starting to grow tired of it . 
are you thinking of getting a new car?
i hate giving big presentations and being the center of attention . 
me too .  its nerve wrecking
i know! like     _comma_      mentally     _comma_      i don t care     _comma_      but my body just responds by making my legs shake     _comma_      my heart pound     _comma_      and speaking too quickly . 
maybe you should take some classes to help you with that
i had to dogsit for my dad about a week ago .  i had to clean up dog poop at least    times _comma_  it was awful . 
ohh  _comma_   cleaning dog poop is always been annoying  _comma_   yet petting the dog is always amusing . 
oh yes .  i wish i could say petting the dogs counteracted having to clean up after them _comma_  but i would be lying . 
ha ha .  i feel sorry for you though .  no one likes to clean the dog poop!
so i was listening to rap in my car with the windows down .  the people in the car next to me were just staring at me .  it was kinda awkward . 
that has happened to me several times
yeah _comma_  not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and i rolled the windows up slightly .  thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn t notice my shame . 
lol .  they probably just laughed about it over dinner
i was really worried about how i d afford textbooks this semester .  
were you able to get them?
yes  _comma_   everything s taken care of  _comma_   thanks to my boyfriend   he surprised me with all of the books i needed!
that was so sweet of him! you re lucky to have such a sweet boyfriend
i was really glad i finished my service for the military
thanks you for your service
it is a pleasure i am really proud i did this for my country
which branch?
i did not expect my car to be soo good for the price i paid
i have never had that feeling . 
yeah it was a used car i was not expecting much but it turned out really well
well thats good .  probaby saved a bunch of coins
i don t like to see my parents smoke it makes me really sad
i would also cry with you!
yeah but it has turned into a normal thing now
i cry at least a day!
i hate when ash from my cigarette drops in my work pants
oof that sucks really bad
yeah  _comma_   i haave to wait till i get home to get the stain off  _comma_   it is really embarrasing
yea i can imagine it is
when katrina hit texas my family lost like half of their belongings
that sucks _comma_  are you going to leave texas or stay?
well when it hit we left but now we are ok and we recovered well
how much did the damage cost you?
i cant stand people that dont flush the toilet
i do not even have a toilet . 
oh _comma_  so where do you go to do your personal buisness
i use the woods!
i guess i will be the next team leader
really? is that a promotion?
yes .  i was expecting that very much . 
good for you . 
my kids and i went to six flags and they wanted me to ride the roller coaster but i had so many reservations about getting on it . 
were you afraid of heights and high speeds?
the high speeds .  it had been so long since i had been on one .  i finally did get on and we had a blast!
i am glad you did .  rollercoasters are thrilling and should not be missed out on!
when i turned    last year _comma_  my kids planned a birthday party for me that i had no idea about . 
oh wow! that sounds very special!!!
it really was and just what i need as i wasn t really happy about turning that corner into my    s . 
im glad your family did that for you
a few weeks ago we were at a wedding .  everyone was dancing and having fun and all of a sudden my   year old niece started to choke on a carrot .  so scary!
oh wow! that must have been terrifying! were they able to help her?
yes _comma_  someone was able to do the heimlich maneuver and she was ok right after that .  it was quite the panic for a few minutes though . 
i could imagine .  it must have been amazing to see her rescued though!
so an online payment distributor company won t instantly verify my bank account even though the login info is correct .  feels bad man . 
that sucks .  did they give you any reason why they won t verify it?
nope .  i even double checked the login info and signed into my bank s website no problem .  i feel a bit let down . 
well _comma_  i hope they can get you taken care of soon .  i know i hate it when i can t get to my money i have online . 
today is my off day and i wanted to sleep in _comma_  yet here i am awake early . 
i am the same .  woke up at   for no reason
it sucks .  i guess my body doesn t want me to sleep in any more . 
lol i hate that
i was dog sitting at my dad s house last week and i heard strange noises in his house . 
what happened?
i don t know _comma_  it was very odd .  i would go in the kitchen and the sink would be running a little bit even though i didn t turn it on .  kind of spooky . 
i understand those kind of situation could scarry . 
last semester _comma_  i had to give a class presentation .  my stomach was full of butterflies from the nerves . 
how did it go?
all things considered _comma_  pretty well .  i definitely had some anxiety about it though .  presentations are my least favorite thing in the world . 
i hate those as well
my aunt recently passed away after a long battle with alzheimer s disease . 
i am so sorry to hear that .  
thanks .  it s been especially hard because she was almost like a mother to me .  
i truly hope you can recover from this major loss in your life . 
so i asked out a girl in my class and she said yes .  was a big morale boost . 
im glad to hear that! 
thanks! we are getting coffee this weekend .  hopefully something comes of it!
good luck to you! i wish you the best
 i always carry a multi tool and a small     screwdriver on me .  i feel like i can fix almost anything with that .

i d like to think so .  i just like to be ready for anything . 
thats cool of you 
i m starting a new position at my job soon . 
oh that s great .  what are you going to be doing?

oh wow  _comma_   that sounds like a tough job  _comma_   but i bet you will be good at it . 
my car is on it s last legs .  i think i see a new car in my future very soon . 
oh _comma_  i m sorry .   what are you thinking of getting?
i would love to get an x terra! i m a big fan of the suv platform . 
nissans are very nice and rugged . 
after dropping out of college   years ago _comma_  i decided to go back this year .

thanks so much! it definitely relieves some stress knowing that i have a safety cushion .  hoping i don t have any emergencies though!
i ll keep my fingers crossed that you won
having a baby   months ago really changed my view on life for the better . 
oh awesome!  congrats!!!!  how has it changed life for you?
i was a heavy drinker   _comma_    and looking back now   _comma_    i know i was in a downward spiral   _comma_    i just couldn t tell at the time .  now i m pursuing my education and have become much more healthy and responsible . 
that s really fantastic!  i m glad to hear you turned your life around .   
my husband and i are going a  cruise with a couple that we have been friends with for a long time _comma_ 
that sounds so great .  who was the one to come up with this plan?
we kind of all came up with it together .  they booked it and we just pay them a certain amount of money each week _comma_  until our part is paid for . 
i see .  i wish i had a partner and we could go to such places together too .  maybe some day hopefully
i hope you can too .  if its ok  _comma_   i would like to pray for you  _comma_   just to maybe help you find someone special . 
i am so proud of my sister
what did she do?
she bought me a car
wow! that was really nice of her! what was the occasion? you guys must be very close . 
we are basically best friends .  it is my birthday and she worked really hard to get a car for me
that is so awesome! i am sure you appreciate her for it .  it s good that you have a great relationship with her . 
i am sad that my parents didn t attend my birthday
do they live in a different state than you?
no _comma_  they just are not wanting to come to it
sorry to hear that .   remember those who mind don t matter and those who matter don t mind
last week at the end of the week i got home from work and was pretty tired .   i ended up just sitting on the couch with my wife and dogs watching tv .   it was nice . 
souds like you were content . 
quite a lot _comma_  actually .   it was a nice way to spend the evening . 
i feel you .  sometimes its nice to veg out and just watch tv . 
i was going to a wedding outside of my city  _comma_   and had arranged to have my dogs watched while i was gone  _comma_   but the person backed out really soon before i had to leave . 
oh no! that s awful!  i watch animals for a few different people and i would never do that .   that s very unprofessional .  did they have an emergency?
something like that _comma_  they were vague .   it was through a company so i couldn t really get much out of them .   luckily a friend stepped up and watched them for me . 
that s ridiculous .   i was going to see who might have helped you .   i m so glad your friend helped .   hope you had a great time!
i was tired last night and my wife was out of town _comma_  so i went to bed early .   i ended up lying with my dogs in bed for a while watching tv before falling asleep . 
what kind of dogs do you have?
a wire haired dacshund and a shephard mix thing
do you like to watch tv with you doggies?
my wife has been out of the country for school for a month and a half .   she gets back in a couple weeks _comma_  and it s getting tougher to wait . 
do you talk with her on the phone?
i do  _comma_   every night .   it s still hard going from having someone around every day to never  _comma_   but i ll get through . 
will you throw her a comeback party?
my dad was cleaning out his attic when he found a box of my old stuff from childhood 
oh _comma_  that s cool .  did you find any good memories in there?
i did! he found my favorite childhood book of mine and i just sat there thinking about all the memories 
nice! it sounds like a really good bonding experience . 
my wife is out of the country for school  _comma_   and the other day she was having a really bad day .   i couldn t really do anything to help  _comma_   and it made me feel bad . 
i m so sorry .   i know you must ve felt helpless but coming from a wife s perspective; i would know my husband couldn t be right next to me but his words and love make all the difference .  
thanks  _comma_   that s actually really helpful .   it s been tough being apart for so long  _comma_   we haven t been apart more than a couple days since we started dating . 
i totally feel you .   my husband as gone for work so much for a couple years .   it will just be a season of life and then you ll be back together!  communicating even more than ever and encouraging each other can help so much .   you re doing great!  i hope you re together soon!
i almost got into a fight the other day at a store . 
so who annoyed you?
a guy budged in front of some other people  _comma_   i confronted him about it  _comma_   and we got into an extremely heated exchange . 
so did it result in a brawl?
no  _comma_   the guy eventually backed off and left  _comma_   albeit not before he flipped me off a few times and called me numerous names . 
for a while my husband was really sick with the flu
i m sorry to hear that .  i hope he s feeling better now . 
he is but i just felt so much love for him because there wasn t anything he could do
he s lucky to have you there . 
when people make me wait _comma_  i get really anxious
i can understand that .  do you try to find ways to fill your time while you re waiting?
not really _comma_  i just look at the clock and wait for the time to come and when they dont arrive in time i start getting anxious
yeah _comma_  waiting for someone can be a real pain .  
i love dogs very much they are always great companions 
i also love dogs . 
i got a puppy not to long ago and love him with all my heart
puppy s are the best .  i love puppies!
my cat broke her leg not too long ago and had to have surgery one it 
how much did you pay for the surgery?
i was lucky cause i know my vet personally so i only paid     usd i was so scared for her
uhmnnn! scared of your cat or the vet?
there was a shooting in a gas station near me i was really devastated
holy hell _comma_  that must have been scary! did you see it happen?
im not sure but there was   victims i was devastated
i m sorry to hear that .  i really hope you are able to get over this and feel at ease again!
i was sad when my dog died
i m so sorry!  that can be a devastating time .  i have been there before .   how long did you have your dog?
i had him for    years .  it s just so hard because he was my whole world
i completely understand .   something that helped me was to have pictures up and also have a little remembrance each year with some other family that loved him as much as i did .   just take it a day at a time . 
i am so lonely because i am all by myself
aw  _comma_   i m sorry  _comma_   well i m here to talk to you! 
i appreciate that .  it s just tough because i go daily without talking to anyone .  it s nice to talk to someone
i feel you .   i ve been in that position _comma_  and it can get dark .   but there s always people online to talk to!
i was really jelous when i say my  neighboor had a new      bmw convertible
that car is quite expensive _comma_  i wish i could afford one too . 
yeah it is i wish i could have a car like that
work hard and maybe you could afford it . 
i am sad that my friends dont visit me
that s sad _comma_  why don t you go visit them?
i don t have a car and they live far away
that s a bummer _comma_  hopefully you can still talk to them over the  phone or online!
i am disgusted that my food didn t come out the way i wanted it
that is not good _comma_  what was wrong with your food?
it was burnt and not appealing
did you ask for a refund when you realized the problem?
when i was young i hit a car on the parking lot and did not say anything 
why didn t you say anything?
i did not see any marks on the other car and was running late
well then i dont blame you .  i would have done the same thing
my sister is so caring _comma_  she took care of me when i was sick
that s very nice of her _comma_  family is one of the best things we have in this world . 
that is so true .  i am so very thankful
as you should be _comma_  some people don t have anyone to lean on in their lives . 
i heard this god awful howling the other night at like  am right outside my window 
that sounds spooky
it was! i was so scared to be honest with you! the worst part is that i don t own a dog either
oh no i hope you stay safe
i was surprised when my mom bought me a car
nice! that s a very nice surprise .   what kind of car?
its a ford mustang
wow  _comma_   she went all out  _comma_   hope you drive safely and have fun with it!
i am very ashamed in my family
i am really sorry to hear that .   why are you ashamed?
because they never invite me to go places _comma_  and they never call me
that is really too bad .   did you all have a fight?
i am disgusted because of my friends pulling pranks on me
that s not nice of them _comma_  are they meaning to be rude?
i dont know .  they have been my friends for so long but these pranks are just making me mad
you should let them know you aren t ok with them doing that .   if they are real friends _comma_  they will stop . 
i was afraid when i got out of the movie theater
how come? what happened?
i was watching a horror film and then i had to walk home alone in the dark
ohhhh .   yea i would be scared too then .   that sounds terrifying . 
i am very faithful that my family will make it home in time
that s good _comma_  where are they?
they are in cuba
wow _comma_  did they go there on vacation?
i am terrified that my wife is going to leave me
why would she leave you?
because she is talking to other men behind my back
oh no _comma_  i m so sorry to hear that .  i know your heart is broken .  did you try to talk to her about it?
i am sad that i won t get to see the movie i want to see
what movie did you want to see?
i wanted to see the first purge
why won t you be able to watch it?
because i didn t have a ride to the movies
we just got back from the beach two weeks ago .  it was such a lovely vacation .  we loved relaxing on the beach and just taking it easy . 
oh yeah that sounds very relaxing! i hope it was good weather for you all! 
it was very nice .  there was a day or two of rain _comma_  but mostly perfect weather!
that s great! im glad you had a good time _comma_  its always nice to have a refresher to get away from everything for a little bit!
my husband and i are going on our very first cruise in december . 
oh boy! where are you headed?
to the caribbean islands .  we are going with another couple that we have been friends with for a very long time . 
congratulations! i hope everything goes well! 
thanks _comma_  me too . 
the other night i was just craving candy .  i ate up all that we had! 
oh _comma_  wow .  its like that sometimes .  you have to give into your sweet tooth . 
sometimes you just have to! it felt so great then but i hated it the next morning! 
ugh _comma_  i hate the regret that comes with giving into food cravings .  don t be too hard on yourself .  it was just one time . 
my husbands cancer free now! 
how awesome .  my husband is   years cancer free
congrats! we are hoping right now that nothing comes back but it s so happy 
it s amazing news .  congrats to you both .  enjoy your time together
i m so frustrated with my husband .  he dismantled the bathroom to do repairs and still hasn t completed them six months later!
six months!  i would be so mad!  what are you going to do about it?
he promised he would complete it within a month and since it s been so long _comma_  i called a contractor today!
good call!  i would have done the same thing!
i ve got a job interview set up for next week and i m really nervous!
i think you will nail it _comma_  are you prepared
i hope so! i bought a couple books on preparing for interviews and i ve done a couple mock interviews with a friend .  
good then you will do well!
my parents always argue and it pisses me off!
i bet _comma_  have you told them how u feel about it?
i have but they rarely listen .  they act like children and it can get frustrating .  what can you do?
i guess just walk away is all
sometimes life just gives you lemons .  at an old job of mine _comma_  i had what will probably remain the worst performance review of my life . 
well you can get better
i m not sure it was really about my performance at all .  i was surprised by the presence of my only adversary there  _comma_   and informed that a large part of my position would be dissolved  _comma_   and i would be answering phones . 
you will do better next time _comma_  i promise
that s must be a relief for you .   i am assuming you have children?
i do not have those
so i guess that sending anyone off to school is not a big deal to you?  do you attend school?
i do not attend school
do you have something you are looking forward to?
my father passed away about       years ago .  it was totally unexpected and really was very traumatic and hurtful to me .  he was still quite young and my family and i had no idea he had a life threatening health issue . 
i am sorry to hear that _comma_  i hope you had some time together before hand
i was pretty close to my father and always lived close by .  but   _comma_    you always wish you had more time .  but   _comma_    the last words i said to him was that i loved him   _comma_    and i m grateful for that . 
that is good at least _comma_  you had some closure at the worst
once when i was younger i went to a friends   th birthday and had a crazy experiene happen
what happened?
we were walking in the front door and it had a glass door apparently but i didn t see it .   it was a very clean door .   lol .   later on that night i won a door prize .   which was pretty funny]
what did you win?
my daughter caught me in a bad mood the other day and was being a bit argumentative .  i lost my temper _comma_  yelled and really hurt her feelings .  i felt bad that it happened . 
oh that sucks .   those are the types of situations where you can t help it _comma_  but you know you did wrong the second after it s over . 
yes    _comma_     i was already not in a good mood    _comma_     and then it seemed like she just pushed the right button .  but    _comma_     i knew i shouldn t have done it as soon as i saw the look in her eyes    _comma_     i felt very bad . 
well _comma_  there aren t any rules against apologizing to your kids?
you never know what someone else is going through _comma_  and looks can be deceiving .  like this old man that seemed like any other drunk . 
yeah you can judge someone like that
it was hard to tell honestly  _comma_   but it turned out the guy was lost and diabetic .  he had lost track of his friends and had no way to get home  _comma_   so i hailed him a cab and paid the driver     . 
thats a nice gesture from you
we hadn t been to the beach and years and really wanting to go back for vacation .  we were able to a few weeks ago and it was awesome .  i was thrilled!
oh man _comma_  the beach always sounds nice
it s was great .  the weather was perfect most of the time _comma_  and we were able to relax and enjoy it so much .  we were really hyped to go!
that sounds like it was lovely
the last time i went to the fair  _comma_   i tripped over a big cord .  this led to me having one of those running falls  _comma_   that seem to last forever! i wanted to disappear at that moment!
i am sure not many people noticed
oh no  _comma_   there were tons of people that noticed lol .  i can laugh now  _comma_   but not at that moment . 
i can imagine _comma_  sorry
i lost a puppy recently and i m still broken up about it . 
i am so sorry i have been there so many times
it s never going to be ok _comma_  but it will be a little less painful in time . 
i am sorry you had to go through that
i m sorry youve been there too .  _comma_ 
it s not fun when a   year old does something he shouldnt . 
what did they do
took a small toy _comma_  put it in his pocket .  took it back to the store and made him return it . 
oh well _comma_  he will learn
yea _comma_  he seems to get it now . 
as a mom i sometimes sneak a sweet treat when i make it out alone . 
you do what you want _comma_  you earn it!
still feel bad when i got an ice cream the other day
why?
i ve had a rough week! the house has been a mess from my dogs and toddler .  my husband hasn t been helping out much _comma_  its fustrating!
why is he not helping?
i m not sure! he has been busy with work but also has been going out with friends a lot :(
oh _comma_  well work can be tough too sometimes
my niece made me proud today _comma_  graduated from her nursing school . 
i bet you are proud
yea _comma_  she s over come a lot for it . 
i am sure she did
since it was my birthday today _comma_  when i came home there was a big pink cake and flowers waiting for me :)
that is sweet _comma_  who from?
my husband! i did not see it coming at all _comma_  thought we were going to wait till the weekend to celebrate . 
wow  _comma_   how sweet of him  _comma_   you are both lucky!
we had to clean out our storage building because of roof damage .  i found an old box of pictures!
what of?
my family and all kinds of old memories    _comma_     birthdays    _comma_     festivals    _comma_     swimming    _comma_     and other stuff
oh  _comma_   that is awesome  _comma_   i love those trips down the old memory lane
it s so hot and our ac just broke .  we had to open the windows to be able to sleep! 
oh wow _comma_  talk about bad timing
the icing on the sweaty cake was that a giant horse fly kept buzzing around the room and the moment you got comfy would land on you
oh no _comma_  i hate flies
i m so excited! my family and i are moving to a new state at the end of this year!
i m ready for a new start for my family and a better paying job!
that is nice .  having a better paying job is always good . 
yes! and new opportunties for my family .  we need the fresh start on life .  i don t like living in texas . 
i ve got back in to running this week _comma_  i missed it! it s a great stress reliever!
wow _comma_  i don t know how you runners do it .  i can t stand running .  how many miles do you run per day on average?
i love to run _comma_  did track and field in high school! right now i m only running   miles till i build my stamina back up! what do you do for excersise? 
i usually jog in the backyard _comma_  but not really running .  i m too fat to run . 
you won t believe the day i ve had! i got to sleep in this morning _comma_  i haven t done that in months!
its always nice to get some sleep
yes  _comma_   my husband even cooked dinner for me today  _comma_   and helped clean the house! he has been very helpful today . 
oh wow _comma_  that was nice of him
this has been a great week! well actually a great year for my family . 
i am glad for you .  i hope it continues
thank you _comma_  my husband got two great job offers!
oh nice _comma_  its good to have options
my daughter is growing up so fast! 
how old is she?
she is   and in pre school! she is doing so well learning how to share and also knows her colors!
wow  _comma_   they do grow up fast  _comma_   appreciate the time you get!
i live in central texas _comma_  it rained and lightening stuck a house here and caused it to burn down!
oh no _comma_  that sounds scary
yes _comma_  i hope the family is okay! no word yet if anyone got hurt .  
i hope they are
my baby is sleeping _comma_  my house is clean .  it s just so nice and peaceful right now
that is not something to take for granted _comma_  enjoy yourself!
i just hope tonight won t be that night when my baby wakes up every    minutes
i hope so too _comma_  best of luck with that!
i feel like a failure _comma_  im suppose to be on a diet but ate too much today!
you can always start tomorrow
thanks _comma_  i keep telling myself to stick with it but its hard! 
it can be hard _comma_  but you can do it
i m thinking about quitting my day job!
why is that?
my boss has been unreasonable and a pain .  he dosen t understand how much time i put into the company!
i get that _comma_  best of luck friend!
tuesday i got to take my kids to the beach for the first time . 
did you have a good time?
we had a blast! i could barely contain myself on the trip there!
they ll always have good memories of the beach . 
my new dog is doing so great _comma_  she was potty trained in a week!
what kind of dog
she is a jack russell _comma_  she loves to cuddle in my lap . 
she does sound adorable
i moved to a new house recently and miss my old one
how long did you live in your old one?
   years _comma_  i hope i get to feel the same way i did in my old house
it ll take some getting used to . 
i feel like i am the best player on my soccer team
sounds like you practice a lot to get good . 
yeah i do i am always the one that steps up in the game
are you the captain?
i ve been having anxiety attacks lately .  everything is great and suddenly i start thinking about something bad happening and i have a full blown anxiety attack over something that didn t even happen
is this a common occurrence?
no _comma_  it just started happening .  i would say it started a couple of months ago .  i will see a doctor in   weeks
that s good .  i hope it s controllable . 
we recently went on vacation and it made me feel reminiscent .  it made me think of the last vacation i was able to spend with my father before he unexpectedly passed away . 
i m so sorry for your loss . 
thank you .  i don t think it matters how old you are when a parent passes away _comma_  it s very painful .  the vacation did bring back great memories with him though . 
he sounds like a great guy .  i m glad you have fond memories of him . 
my friend can literally eat junk food all day long and stay skinny! she doesn t even work out .  and here i am  _comma_   eating healthy  _comma_   working out and still loking fat
she may be skinny _comma_  but it doesn t mean she s healthy . 
that s true too! but i just wish i looked like her
yea _comma_  i totally understand that .  she won the genetic lottery there . 
it was my birthday and my friend sent me a birthday card with a gift card in a mail .  i never got it _comma_  somebody stole it! and we actually have a cluster mailbox so only i can open it .  it means that usps worker stole it
have you tried speaking with the post office?
i did _comma_  the lady told me they can t do anything about it because it didn t have a tracking number .  
that s ridiculous _comma_  they should have to do something . 
my cat was playing last nigh and brought it to me . 
that sounds like fun .  what did it bring to you?
well _comma_  it wasn t one of his toys like i thought .  it was a dead mouse
eww .  that s pretty gross .  i had a cat once that would bring me dead birds too .  i think that means they like you!
my son just used a potty for the first time! he is only    months .  i m so proud of him
watch out! next thing you turn around _comma_  and he s driving . 
i know! they  grow up so fast! i feel like i just gave a birth to him and look at him now
i hope you got some photos . 
sometimes things don t work out like you planned .  it can be a real let down though . 
what happened?
i got two tickets for a friend and i for a concert .  the day of the show _comma_  it poured and no one got a refund . 
that is bad .  you should have got refunded . 
my family went on a road trip this week and had to stop at a gas station for the bathroom . 
how d that go?
well the bathroom seemed cleaned but the roaches told me otherwise . 
oh god _comma_  roaches .  did you guys use the bathroom anyway?
it sounds crazy to say  _comma_   but even though i was hit by a car on my bicycle  _comma_   it could have been much worse . 
are you okay?
i m quite fine now (my knee has a plate and six screws) .  i am just glad that the driver stopped and called an ambulance!
oh my gosh _comma_  a plate! that kinda sounds serious . 
it might be  _comma_   but considering i m    with an artificial hip as well  _comma_   i ve gotten used to being half metal . 
last semester was probably the largest challenge of my life .  i go to school for electrical engineering _comma_  and i took   courses . 
that is a lot .  most i ever took at one time was   classes and i cried at least twice that semester . 
oh my gosh then you know! i have to say though _comma_  it all came out in the wash     as and   bs!
damn that is impressive congrats .  i took   class last semester and got an a lol
waiting for something to come in the mail can send me in to a tizzy .  it s even worse when it s parts i need to finish a computer repair job . 
that s true .  did you finish the job?
i did get it done in the end .  it was a nail biter since the client was leaving the day after the parts came . 
that s really great .  it s nice when everything works out in the end . 
have you ever lost control of your bowels as an adult?
oh _comma_  all the time .  i ve got to change my depens three times a day . 
phew! i m glad i am not the only one .  although for me  _comma_   it happened in the middle of dinner at a small vietnamese restaurant  _comma_   and an employee walked in on me cleaning my pants in the sink!
oh wow .  i just would ve blamed it on whoever i was with . 
i went to a heavy metal music festival in las vegas a few years ago! i had fun _comma_  but to be honest it was a bit of an emotional roller coaster . 
oh _comma_  i don t know why concerts make me feel a bit sentimental
i think it s because everybody can relate when it comes to live music .  my girlfriend broke up with me the second day _comma_  but we had to stay in the same room . 
that must have been horrible! i m so sorry you went thru that
you know how sometimes things don t go as planned _comma_  but it feels like they turn out better in the end?
yes _comma_  some people call it fate . 
you could call it that! i was supposed to go to a social event _comma_  but it got rained out and i ended up watching the rain for hours with my girlfriend . 
that sounds so romantic!
my father was having abdominal pain _comma_  so he went to the hospital and they discovered a tumor . 
oh no _comma_  was it benign?
it was cancerous  _comma_   but the surgery to remove it seemed to go well .  a few days later he passed away suddenly  _comma_   with no exact cause of death . 
that is so terrible _comma_  i m so sorry . 
i love it when the new star wars movies come out _comma_  seeing all those kids (and adults) dress up for the theater really takes me back! 
do you dress up when the new movies come out also?
i don t anymore  _comma_   but when i was a kid  _comma_   a friend and i dressed up as the hero and the villain for the premiere of episode i .  
ah _comma_  i bet seeing all of the kids now dressed up does take you back to an earlier time .   nostalgia has a way of getting to each of us . 
on our second date _comma_  my girlfriend and i stopped in a dive bar on our way back from the beach . 
what is a dive bar
like a hole in the wall .  cheap drinks  _comma_   sometimes a little dirty  _comma_   but altogether relaxed   the opposite of snoody .  they had a pool table and i showed her some tricks . 
oh ok .  we call them hole in the walls lol
yeah  _comma_   i should have just said that .  honestly though  _comma_   my favorite places to drink . 
mine too . 
my father passed away a few years ago _comma_  but i still have my grandfather s watch that he gave to me . 
are you going to pass it down too?
i honestly hope to .  every time i look at it i remember the good times we had together . 
well thats nice
hanging out with old flames can be tricky when you are in a committed exclusive relationship . 
oh yeah that can be a mine field to walk across .  didn t have any issues?
actually  _comma_   an ex was in town recently and we went for a drink .  she made a pass at me  _comma_   but i told her to get some rest and went home to my girlfriend . 
that s very faithful of you _comma_  and the right thing to do i d say .  
going near hights really makes me scared
did a specific experience cause this? or just instinct . 
just instinc i think i have always been afraid of heights 
thats interesting my mother has always been afraid of heights _comma_  not myself though . 
during carnival season _comma_  there is a big rave at an undisclosed location in the middle of the night . 
i use to go to raves when i was in high school . 
they are a lot of fun! i must admit though _comma_  i was pretty nervous when the cops showed up to shut it down . 
did you get arrested?
well  _comma_   there were only two officers and a couple hundred of us .  by the time we were all walking away from the warehouse  _comma_   i was actually laughing . 
my girl friend broke up with me about a month ago
why did she break up with you?
we where just not getting along _comma_  and did not h ave enough time to see each other
are you still friends with her?
yes we are
i was always terrified of haunted houses when i was little . 
me too! the first one i ever went to traumatized me . 
glad i m not the only one! my friend has a birthday in october and she wanted us to go to one as a group .  i m still not sure if i ll go _comma_ 
that seems like a weird birthday activity . 
my sister snores really hard every night it is getting really anoying
have you ever woke her up and told her to stop?
well it is not really her fault it just makes me angry hahah
thats hilarious _comma_  my mother snores like a monster
my friend and i spotted a mini gold course when we were coming back from the next state over . 
yes! thats actually amazing _comma_  you have a good friend!
i know! we played a round and they let us play a second round for free!
you are lucky! who won?
i feel excited about our upcoming baby shower
yay! is it a family member having a baby
i m having a baby boy!
what?!?! thats amazing! starting a family i imagine can be surreal 
i am really exited for my vacation next summer 
oh yeah? where are you going?
california _comma_  i really hope i get to go to universal studios
that sounds like a lot of fun
when she left for   weeks i was alone
did you do anything special during your alone time?
nothing at all .  i was kinda depressed
that is not good _comma_  you should try to find an activity for when you are alone
my calculus final was no joke! i started studying hard two weeks before the test . 
that is insane _comma_  i usually give myself like   or   days . 
trust me it all paid off .  when i went in to take the test _comma_  i was absolutely solid on the material . 
thats right! thats such a good feeling _comma_  just breezing through a test . 
felt sad when she left for   weeks
where did she go?
to see her family .  it sucked though because my car had broken down . 
oh _comma_  i bet that was frustrating .  did you get evey thing squared away and taken care of?
i am happy with where we are now living
where are you living at?
a very nice complex with   pools!
that sounds amazing
i interviewed for a new job and the interview went really well . 
that s great to hear .  what made you think it went well?
the interviewer made all the comments you d expect from a good interview and seemed to respond well to my answers . 
those are good signs! sounds like you hit it out of the park!
some people are just naturals .  the first time i played pool with a friend of mine _comma_  she had to beat the guy running the table . 
pool s always a difficult game to pick up .  i m guessing your first time went well?
i shot so so _comma_  but my friend ended up winning the table and beating   guys in a row . 
wow .  talking about cleaning up . 
i didn t receive a scholarship in college that i really wanted despite being qualified for it . 
are you still going to attend it?
yes _comma_  i ll still attend but the extra help would ve been nice . 
of course _comma_  but at least you can still afford it . 
i know things will work out in god s perfect timing
yes  _comma_   i agree  _comma_   are you hoping for something in particular . 
yes i am .  for everything we want for the baby to be gifted to us lol
that s a good hope .  good luck with that .  
my sister graduated from college after a long road of persistence and determination . 
that is great _comma_  i bet she is very proud of herself . 
yes _comma_  she is .  my family and i are very happy with her accomplishments . 
as you should be _comma_  so many young people give up before reaching their goals . 
i like being alone _comma_  but not feeling bad when no one is around to talk to
me time is very crucial for anyone _comma_  it help one clear hi or her mind .  we are so much alike . 
it s true i do need my alone time
sort of reduces stress _comma_ very crucial
dog ate grass and then threw up
oh no! hopefully he is ok .  did you take him to the vet?
well she was ok .  shouldn t have been so silly
what a silly dog than! she will learn to not do that again!
i am so happy to be having a boy
that s great! congratulations! is this your first child?
thanks .  yes it is .  i already got a crib and baby bath . 
congratulations _comma_  again .  parenthood is truly a great and wonderful experience . 
when i was younger   _comma_    i worked really hard to save up money for a car   _comma_    but needed a bit more .  but on my birthday   _comma_    my parents paid the rest for me . 
that s so cool of them .  that s how parents should be
i agree .  i really wanted to do it myself _comma_  but it s something i ll never forget . 
we all need a little help sometimes
i recently went on my first international trip by myself . 
great _comma_  where did you go?
to visit my family for about   weeks _comma_  i got married a few years ago and my husband and i live pretty far from them now . 
was it a good trip overall?
yes _comma_  just very nerve racking dealing with the international flights and passport checks and security checks .  definitely an experience . 
i was very proud of her for flying all by herself
yes _comma_  flying is very hard to do .  
especially with   full suitcases
yeah _comma_  and so little you can actually care on instead of checking . 
i don t generally trust people .  
why don t you trust?
upbringing .  dad use to say never trust anyone before i left for school every morning
he is correct .  but you should trust some people whom you think they re good . 
you just can t trust people any more .  my mechanic told me it was going to be       to fix my jeep . 
wow that sounds pretty high to me .  what was wrong with it?
turns out _comma_  nothing much at all .  a guy down the street got it running for      . 
wow what a crook that other guy was!
i am so happy that we re having a baby boy
congratulations! is this your first child?
yes it is .  i am over the moon
i m so happy for you .  have you two thought of a name yet?
i ve just successfully completed my first international flight trip by myself . 
was it any fun?
yes _comma_  i got to see my family so it was great! i had to be very organized .  the flights and layovers were kind of intense .  
yes _comma_  i wish flying was a bit faster . 
i was so sad to find out what she had done .  found it on her facebook message history . 
oh no _comma_  what did she do
she met up with her ex to return his t shirt . 
oof _comma_  that can get messy . 
i am currently expecting my first baby _comma_  it s a boy!
congratulations! when is it due?
october _comma_  right around the corner! 
are you excited? do you have a name in mind?
i recently went tubing on a river with my girlfriend and her friends from college . 
did you enjoy it?
i had a blast! it s supposedly a four hour float but we were out there for eight!
amazing! did you go down rapids and do scary stuff?
my girlfriend s dog was a    year old chihuahua who emerged from a bathroom at a party in      . 
emerged from a bathroom? intiguing .  what do you mean?
he just sort of showed up and no one knew where he came from .  he passed away recently after running away from our friends farm and being struck by a car . 
oh   i m sorry to hear that _comma_  but it sounds like he had a bit of character about him
i can t believe my girlfriend was still interested in me after she saw the slum i was living in . 
it must be true love!
something like that .  my room was in shambles and the house was falling apart! i was mortified when she asked to come inside . 
i feel like that sometimes   but people have usually seen worse . 
once after a night on the town _comma_  i came home and my room had been ransacked . 
oh no! i bet you were terrified! 
the thing is _comma_  my alcoholic room mate was the culprit .  he had even thrown some of my belongings in the bathtub!
were you guys angry or frustrated with each other?
i am expecting my first child .  it is going to be a boy! we are preparing the nursery and getting everything in order for his arrival!
must be such an exciting time for your family! 
yes _comma_  it is!
be sure to get plenty of rest thought! its easy to lose sleep in such a time . 
a few months back _comma_  one of my girlfriend s close friends died from a heroin overdose . 
oh _comma_  i am so sorry .  were you also close to them?
i only met him a few times _comma_  but he touched a lot of people s lives . 
what a sad way to go .  if only he could have gotten help . 
an extremely timid girl in my physics class invited the class to see her band play at a bar downtown . 
wow   hidden depths .  are you going?
i actually went last friday night .  turns out she is an incredible guitarist   a real shredder!
amazing .  just shows that you can t judge a book by it s cover
i am pretty sure everyone is scared of being trapped in an elevator _comma_  and i can confirm it s quite a shock . 
oh my _comma_  did it happen to you recently?
yes just a couple weeks ago .  the elevator screeched to a halt and the lights went out _comma_  and i have to confess i screamed . 
that sounds terrifying! must have been like a nightmare for you . 
i thank god every day for the many blessings .  especially our new home
when did you move in?
  months ago now .  it s really nice here _comma_  there are   swimming pools
 !!! amazing
right after i had my baby  _comma_   my husband worked second shift  _comma_   so he didn t get home until around  am . 
wow that s a tough schedule .  especially with a new baby . 
yeah   _comma_    but it wasn t really a problem   _comma_    until one night around   pm .  i was changing her diaper .  the changing table was in front of a window   _comma_    and i could hear people running up and down the porch in front of the window and they were banging on the house . 
why were they doing that?
i m not sure .  doors and windows were locked _comma_  but i was so relieved when my husband got home . 
i m a youth leader _comma_  and just the other day a teen from the group was asked to speak at a local church . 
oh that s awesome! what was the teen asked to speak about? are they nervous?
he was nervous  _comma_   he has to prepare an original message .  he did really good  _comma_   and he really showed and understanding of the bible . 
when i was growing up i know that my youth leader made a huge impact on me _comma_  so it s really a great thing that you do working with kids .  
thank you .  
i get so mad when i have to repeat myself
try not to get so tense _comma_  that can harm your health
i know .  but it makes me stressed out
take a deep breath and calm the discomfort  .  that helps
hello  .  today i am happy _comma_  we go with my children to the movies and then to eat pizza
cool .  pizza is my fav food .  what movie you guys going to see?
the incredible  .  they love  .  it s going to be fun
i love that movie also .  have fun 
thank you very much and you too . 
graduating from college was a load off my shoulders .  
wow i am so proud of that
thanks _comma_  it was a long journey . 
was it expensive ? any student loans ?
i was turned down for a job i really thought i d be a good fit at . 
did they give you any reason for not giving you the job?
someone else interviewed who had much more experience than i did . 
well _comma_  at least a candidate that deserved the job got it .  
i went to a sketchy part of town once .  just being there put me on edge . 
i bet .  i m not a very confrontational person so i do everything i can to avoid places like that
it was for work so i had to do it _comma_  but i typically avoid those places as well
you should bring it up to your boss at work for a security guard to accompany you next time!
we went to a friend s house the other day for dinner .  i was helping her cook .  i was following the directions of a recipe and accidentally cracked her baking dish . 
did you offer to replace the broken baking dish that you accidently broke?
yes  _comma_   i did  _comma_   but she wouldn t even hear of it .  she told me it was fine . 
that sounds like a good friend _comma_  forgive and forget .  she new you did not intend on breaking the baking dish . 
i am looking forward to moving into a easy place to take care of . 
that sounds good .  are you moving soon?
no  _comma_   not moving soon  _comma_   only wanting to and looking around to see what is affordable .  
i hope you find something that you like and are happy with .  its really important to be happy with where you live . 
so i had an emergency come up for my family and i had enough money to cover it .  i feel great for preparing!
that is always a good feeling .  such a relief . 
definitely! and they are paying me back _comma_  so it isn t like i m losing money either . 
it was nice of you to step up and help out . 
i drank a lot of alcohol at my friend s bbq party _comma_  and i ended up puking and passing out .  not my finest moment . 
haha  _comma_   i can relate to that .  i did that too  _comma_   and my friends took a wonderful photo of it .  they like to stick it on our yearly christmas cards to each other
hahahaha! well _comma_  i guess we can make light of even our worst moments . 
you have to :) everyone has bad moments and if you can t laugh at them _comma_  then they just eat you up!
my eldest son just graduated high school i was so proud . 
how exciting! that is a great accomplishment . 
it s kind of a surreal feeling tho _comma_  hard to accept that he is grown .   now college is about to start . 
i know how you feel .  my oldest is in her sophomore year of college .  
the time just flys by doesn t it?  it hard to imagine that they dont need you so much anymore .   
so a customer just came into my work and started yelling at me for something that wasn t my fault .  i hate when people do that!
did you talk to them politely or yell back ?
no _comma_  i didn t yell back haha .  i would get fired . 
what industry are you in _comma_  i find that a lot in retail and service
retail _comma_  yep . 
it makes me angry when people never notice me
why what is it that you want them to notice about you that they bypass .  
everything .  i don t have friends so it s nice to get noticed
i completely understand think of it as maybe they are not meant to be apart of your life _comma_  you will find some good friends just be patient .  
i get excited when i go swimming
what is exciting to you about swimming?
the fact of relaxing in a large pool of water .  it just grabs my attention
so you prefer a pool to an ocean?
my wife wasn t feeling so well _comma_  so i took care of her and made her some soup   
that is so sweet i love a caring husband has she gotten better?
she is much better now! i love her so much _comma_  so i try to take good care of her . 
as you should a good husband is what keeps us women strong also good for you she is lucky to have you .  
i am so grateful to my family
i feel you! what do they do for you?
they help me with whatever i need and they are always their for me . 
its rare to have that! i have it now too .  it is great to know you have someone to rely on and trust!
i was surprised when my parents threw me a party
i bet that was a nice feeling
it really was .  i am pretty thankful for them
i bet you were
a big wind storm blew through town and uprooted one of the trees in my yard . 
yikes! was anything damaged? 
no  _comma_   but that was my fear .  i kept waiting to hear the sound of a branch or tree hitting my roof  _comma_   or breaking glass . 
that s pretty scary .  i m glad there wasn t any damage and that you re okay . 
i took my dog to an agility competition and she ended up winning first place! 
wow _comma_  congratulations! that must have taken a lot of training and practice . 
thanks so much! it did _comma_  but she s so hard working and i couldn t have done it without her . 
what kind of dog is she _comma_  and how long have you been competing like this?
i was sad when my parents left me
did you stay with other relatives?
i stay with my older sister now
do you enjoy that?
my brother got a really high paying job and now spends all his time flaunting his money . 
i bet that s kind of a pain .  how are you dealing with it?
not very well! i mostly just stew and complain about it and wish i had his money and lifestyle . 
i bet .  it s so annoying when people show off like that . 
i was disgusted when my food had a hair in it
ewww did you get a refund or at least a voucher ?
yeah i got a refund .  they were very sorry about it and i forgave them
i would have blasted them on yelp
i was anxious when i went to the theme park
what about the them park made you anxious?
the roller coasters
they can be really scary for people who do not like them . 
i was furious when my friend made fun of me in front of random strangers . 
why did your friend do that to you?
i am not sure .  he told me he was sorry afterwards but i didn t listen to him
i am not sure i would be able to forgive someone of something like that _comma_  it is really rude behavior . 
i feel so lonely because i have no friends
i m sorry to hear that .  have you tried joining clubs or hanging out with people from work?
i haven t .  im too shy and i am scared of what people will say
i know how that is .  
i was jealous when my girlfriend was talking to other guys
i understand how you d feel that way .  do you trust her around other guys?
i do not .  i have trust issues
ah .  that can be tough in a relationship . 
i was terrified when i watched that horror film in the theaters
i understand .  horror movies freak me out _comma_  too .  did you watch the whole thing?
i did but it was really a challenge for me . 
i bet .  i don t think i could sit through a whole one . 
i was sad when my dad died
how long ago did that happen?
it happened   weeks ago
i am so sorry to hear  _comma_   if you need to talk to someone about it  _comma_   i am here for you
i was sad when my wife left me
she must not have loved you
i just dont know why she would marry me then . 
people change over time _comma_  is she thinking of coming back ?
my family and i went to the beach on tues and spent the whole day there . 
was the weather good?
one small thunderstorm but other than that great! i m amazed i didn t really get burnt!
that is awesome _comma_  i am sure you can not wait to go back
when someone talks down to me _comma_  it makes me sad
perhaps try telling the person how it makes you feel
i am just too shy to say anything .  i dont know how
have confidence in yourself and be stern about it . 
i am super joyful when my family comes together to eat dinner
that sounds nice .  how often does this usually happen?
usually once a week .  its a great feeling
i hope this continues for you for a long time . 
i was surprised when my parents threw me a big party
was it for your birthday?
it was .  i had a great time
did you guys get to eat the cake?
i am so annoyed that people are so mean to other people
its just the way the world is now _comma_  social media has ruined humanity
that is so true! i dont know where this world is heading . 
it can t get any better than it already is now .  
i get so jealous when my parents don t pay me any attention . 
have you told them how you feel?
i haven t because i don t know how to start that conversation . 
just sit them down and talk about the way they are treating you
i was furious when my dog ate the wires to my television
that must have been so annoying .  hopefully you can just get a replacement . 
yeah but it will take a few days because i have to wait for my paycheck
i hope he doesnt do it again . 
so what happens in the middle of the night? i got woken  _comma_   again  _comma_   by my upstairs neighbor thumping around .  does she have to be so rude?!
that is so annoying _comma_  some people just dont have morals
no  _comma_   they don t .  well  _comma_   this time i ve had enough .  i ve told management i want into another apartment and explained exactly why!
can you afford to move ?
not really  _comma_   but the alternative is to go slowly mad .  these blessed individuals stomp around day and night  _comma_   screeching into their cellphones   they re horrible . 
i am a very trusting person .  it gets me in trouble sometimes . 
how does it get you into trouble?
people take advantage of me 
i m sorry to hear that .  i guess at least if helps you know you can trust in the future and who you can t . 
i m only   months away from having my aa in healthcare administration . 
so proud of yourself right ?
i really am _comma_  i can t wait to start my new career!
you will be making more money
going to the dentist always has me on edge .  i hate it!
i hate going to the dentist _comma_  too .  you just gotta go through with it . 
i know . it s a necessary evil .  but it hurts so much!
by now  _comma_   wish it was less painful  _comma_   hu?
one of my very dear friends got his dream job recently .  he was so diligent in finding information and contacts .  i so respect what he s achieved . 
that s cool .  i wish i had my dream job
well  _comma_   it takes perseverance and a bit of luck  _comma_   but you can do it!
my dream job is being born rich .  its too late for that
lol _comma_  you and me both .  you could always marry a kardashian!
ick .  
or someone not quite so objectionable :) seriously though _comma_  i m so happy for k with his new job . 
we started watching a red sox game near the end and they were losing .  next thing you know _comma_  they were ahead four runs . 
whoa that is always exciting .  baseball can be boring at times . 
yes _comma_  usually i think so too .  but this was really fun to watch and we were so happy because it did not look good at first . 
i love sports .  i am glad you got to experience that . 
my car that i hate is going to die soon and i ll be able to get a new one .  score!
woot! that s great! which brand are you thinking?
i m thinking something reliable .  maybe a toyota or mazda . 
toyota is a great choice
yesterday my husband opened a window and a huge black bug flew in!! i almost died!! 
ew omg did you kill it?
heck no _comma_  i told my husband to deal with it .  i ran in my bedroom and locked the door
eek! sounds frightening!
well  _comma_   don t you know  _comma_   one of my neighbors who works for aa was in san francisco recently and saw some scottish cheese (i m scottish) .  so she bought some and brought it to me .  how nice of her to do that!
that was nice! what does scottish cheese taste like?
this particular one was a cheddar and it tends to be from smaller producers and is creamier and more flavorful than the cheeses we typically get here . 
cheddar is one of my favorites .  i live pretty close to cabot creamery and i love their sharp cheddar . 
ooh _comma_  i haven t tried cabot .  must look out for it .  the cheddar i normally get is from tillamook .  i think it s from oregon .  where s cabot from?
it s located in a small farming town in vermont .  i went on a tour of their factory once and it was interesting to see the cheese being made . 
i ve never done that .  wonder if there s a cheese factory near me .  i m in nc _comma_  where the people almost all seem as nice as my kind neighbor!
you should definitely check to see _comma_  or stop by cabot if you ever visit vermont . 
my brother would ve turned    today .  he died   years ago and it still hurts so much
i m sorry to hear that _comma_  that s very sad .  were you two close?
yes we were .  he moved to the different country but we spoke pretty often
that s a bummer _comma_  i m sure he is looking out for you up above!
i had planned to go to the beach with friends _comma_  but it looks like it s going to rain . 
ah man  _comma_   that s a buzz kill  _comma_   are you still going to rough it out in the rain?
nah  _comma_   it said there s be thunder and lightning  _comma_   so looks like we re stuck inside :(
ah dang _comma_  well there s always next weekend!
i spent last weekend with most of my family _comma_  they live out of state and i don t see them often . 
did you have a good time visiting with them?
i did _comma_  yes .  work has been hectic lately so i was really looking forward to unwinding with them .  
what did you guys do?
we ate good food _comma_  drank wine and went swimming .  
that sounds fun .   was the weather nice?
it was _comma_  kind of hot but not enough to complain about .  
what sort of food did you eat?
i hate how our country is so divided right now
it is _comma_  but i think it was all along and people are just standing up for what they believe in more now . 
true .  i hope we can become less divided in the future and solve things
maybe _comma_  but i think the best we can hope for is tolerance . 
my father passed away about   years ago .  it was so very difficult for me and very unexpected .  we didn t know he had a life threatening illness and weren t prepared in any way for his sudden departure from us . 
i m very sorry to hear that .   losing anyone close to you _comma_  especially a parent would be very hard .   are you close to other members of your family and were you able to help each other through it?
yes   _comma_    my family and i are close and we were there for each other .  but   _comma_    my sister had passed away around   years before   _comma_    by committed suicide .  the last few years have been very difficult . 
i bet it has .   keep sticking by with your family .   i m sure you are all there for each other more than you know . 
i feel like a terrible sibling right now .  
what did you do to feel that way?
my sister  _comma_   who lives out of state and i don t see often  _comma_   was recently in town visiting our dad .  i didn t visit with them . 
i m sorry to hear that _comma_  you could make it up to them by going to visit?
i am going to a concert very soon . 
cool! who are you going to see?
imagine dragon and grace vanderwhall _comma_  do you know them?
of course! grace is so talented! she was on america s got talent _comma_  right? i get all those reality talent shows confused . 
yes she was . 
our new property management person is remarkably efficient .  she emailed me details of a conversation we had yesterday .  the others promise the earth and don t deliver!
wow _comma_  that sounds amazing!
it is .  i ve been trying to switch apartments for months and this is the first time someone has actually done anything about it . 
great news then!
absolutely! i move september  st .  no more stompy screechy neighbors at   am!!
school for my kids started again this past thursday . 
how was that? were you excited for some more quiet and for them to get back on a schedule? or are you sad that it shows that they re getting older?
it was good .  i am dealing with a mixture of both emotions about them being back in school .  i was happy i had all the supplies   _comma_    clothes   _comma_    shoes   _comma_    and other odds and ends in time . 
ah   _comma_    that s interesting you say that .  i thought you d just be like everyone else   _comma_    who say   _comma_     happy to nudge them out the door!  you sound like a good parent
i had planned a beach trip about a month before we actually went . 
what beach were you heading too?
we went to virginia beach earlier this week .  i was so giddy up that whole month i could barely contain myself . 
who all went with you? that sound so fun . 
my husband _comma_    kids and my mother .  my kids had never been to the beach . 
that s awesome _comma_  have you ever tried surfing?
i bought a ticket last week for the lottery _comma_  when it was over     million dollars . 
did you win? lol
i was so excited watching the numbers being drawn _comma_  but no i didn t win .  but someone did! i m sure they were happy . 
winning those huge jackpots is always a curse .   go for a smaller win :)
true _comma_  but it would be fun spending that money . 
my husband just found out he will start getting a monthly bonus! this was unexpected and great news
that is so exciting .  a little extra cash can always help . 
it sure does .  it came as a shock _comma_  but a pleasant one .  
yes _comma_  that would be a great surprise .  it can also take a lot of stress off of you . 
i just went today to visit my son in his new house . 
how was it
it was great! he has saved for so long to buy it .  
thats cool
so tonight we are suppose to go eat out as a family but i cant get a single one of my family members to agree on a place .   so frustrating!
you should make a wheel you can spin to decide .   i did that once . 
that s actually not a bad idea .   wish i had come up with that earlier .   it seems everyone wants something different . 
yes you put all the places on it and spin . 
im going to have to sue that for next week .   i think this week they can all go make pb&j since they want to be difficult . 
put that on there too!
i guess that way the wallet wins every once and awhile too!  lol
i m so happy that it is friday!
oh me too! do you have a monday to friday type job?
somewhat _comma_  i work      hour shifts and have a random off day during the week .  yesterday was my off day .  what about you?
oh that is a pretty good schedule .  i am a teacher so i m off right now .  it s wonderful .  
feels disappointed because my friend fights with me
maybe its time for a new friend . 
no i can t because i love him a lot
ask him to stop being a jerk?
i have lupus and it is getting worse .   i asked my doctor for a chance to try a new diet i found that is suppose to help me with it . 
oh dear _comma_  that must be difficult .  are there medications to take that will help?
yes _comma_  but they are quite powerful which i am trying to avoid .   i am already on one and i am hoping that through this diet i can get off b c the next steps won t be fun
oh _comma_  i m really sorry .  that is for sure a challenge .  
some time ago   _comma_    there was a terrible tornado that came through my city .  it destroyed many homes   _comma_    a school and some people died .  i was so fearful and petrified it would come by our home and destroy it   _comma_    or harm my family!
i m glad you were safe .  tornados are not a fun thing to experience . 
no _comma_  they are so awful! they can destroy so much . 
have you only had to deal with one?
my husband took me to get a new wedding band recently
well _comma_  that s very nice .  i m sure you were looking forward to that shopping trip . 
i didn t know ahead of time! mine had broken a bit and he saved up to get me a new one . 
that s was so thoughtful and sweet! seems like you are a lucky wife!
i love the holidays .  driving around looking at decoration is my favorite . 
that is a lot of fun .   what is your favorite holiday to drive around in?
christmas .  it makes me miss my moms decor . 
im sorry it makes you miss your moms decor .   at least you have those memories to hang onto . 
i have a wonderful sister in law .   who is always there for me when i need her
that must be comforting!  it is good to have people in your life that are supportive . 
i feel so lucky to have her as a sister in law and a friend .   she is always there to offer a supporting ear and encouraging word . 
don t ever take her for granted!  make sure she knows you are thankful!
a few weeks ago    _comma_     we finally got a chance to get back to the beach for our vacation .  but    _comma_     it rained several days    _comma_     so we didn t get to spend as much time at the beach as we wanted    _comma_     which sucked .  we were really looking forward to it . 
oh _comma_  i m sorry to hear that .  do you not live close to a beach?
oh   _comma_    no   _comma_    it was about a   hour drive! my daughter was quite young when we went and didn t remember the first trip and she s a teenager now .  so   _comma_    a long time since we first went . 
that must suck not living close to a beach .  hopefully you get to go back real soon . 
my husband just a promotion at work he was really wanting
hah _comma_  seems we both had some luck .  good for him!
i know . ha ha!  he worked so hard for this and i am so proud of him . 
you guys should go out and celebrate! 
we took a vacation recently and had to leave my daughter s teenage boyfriend a key to our house so he could take care of the pets .  he s a good young man _comma_  so we didn t feel uncomfortable anything would come up missing . 
lucky! i would not trust anyone in my house!
we didn t have much choice     _comma_      as we had an outdoor dog and indoor cat     _comma_      so if we didn t     _comma_      we d come back to not having pets .  but     _comma_      i wouldn t just let anybody     _comma_      that s for sure!
i am happy for you! 
my mother in law once told a secret of mine that she promised she would never tell
oh no! that s my greatest fear that people will tell my secrets
i know it really hurt me and i had to work on trusting her again with other things
aw _comma_  perhaps she just slipped up? it does happen even to the best of us
one night when my children and i came home _comma_  i saw a shadow inside! i was so fearful and afraid!
oh that can be scary .  i don t watch horror movies because i know that i ll do just that!
it was so scary! luckily  _comma_   it was actually my shadow! the light made my shadow show up  _comma_   but it first appeared to be an intruder!
well i m glad you were ok! sometimes it s not just a shadow
last weekend   _comma_    my family and i enjoyed a nice meal together   _comma_    and then watched a movie .  it was a relaxing time at home   _comma_    just enjoying each other s company . 
that s the best kind of day . 
yes _comma_  it was drama free and a relaxing time . 
must have been so nice _comma_  what movie did you watch?
my dog _comma_  riley had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure
i am so sorry to hear about riley _comma_  i know he was an important part of the family .  how is everyone holding up after the news?
it was one of the hardest things i had to go through but i know that riley is not suffering anymore so that helps
yes that is true .  you know there is peace in another place .  he will always be remembered . 
i didn t tell my friend when her boyfriend hit on me .  she was in a bad spot and needed him for financial support  _comma_   and that s why i didn t tell her .  but  _comma_   i still felt so bad about it . 
i can empathize with you there .   do you think there might be another way to let her know? 
well  _comma_   she had custody of her handicapped grandchild and no job  _comma_   plus she was very much in love with him .  i thought it would just make things worse for her . 
well money is not everything _comma_  one day it will come out and then the timing will likely be worse . 
i am trying a new diet to treat my lupus .   
really!  good for you!  are you excited to start or nervous?
i am nervous b c so much rides on if this works or not .   if it doesn t than i have to take some really powerful meds that i would rather not take
it s ok to be nervous  _comma_   but don t let it stop you!  no risk  _comma_   no reward!
there s a coworker that will not follow instructions on work assignments  _comma_   so she makes many mistakes .  it s so frustrating and aggravating  _comma_   since it causes others more work . 
that sucks _comma_  i work with people like that and it s just more work for other people
exactly! you try nicely to explain it to her over and over _comma_  but she won t listen .  such a nuisance!
that s horrible _comma_  you should tell the boss and get her fired
my mother picked my daughter up for school to take in the morning _comma_  and found her cat dead .  it was so hard for my daughter and made us all very upset . 
i bet it was .   death is never an easy thing to deal with _comma_  especially for a child . 
yes  _comma_   she was only about    _comma_   and loved her cat so much .  it broke my heart to see her so upset!
i hope she will be alright!  i remember how devastated i was when my last dog passed away and i was an adult .   a kids emotions seem to amplify everything! 
i decided to play the lottery the other day and won . 
you are lucky!
not normally _comma_  so i was quite surprised .  
how much did you win?
      .  it was enough to help me catch up on my bills .  so i was happy . 
i have never won that much .  congratulations
thank you _comma_  that was the first time i have ever won anything like that .  i almost passed out .  
i have a bad experience at the supermarket the other day .  
oh no! what happened?
someone backed into my new car . 
oh geez _comma_  thats terrible!  did they run from the scene?  hopefully they left some information .   i was in a hit and run about   months after i bought my new car and i felt sick that it was already hit . 
yes _comma_  they ran! i was so mad when i got to the car and saw it .  
many years ago  _comma_   we were at a friend s house and one of her friend s was there and she was drunk .  my husband was very insistent on helping her  _comma_   but i felt he was being a bit to  helpful  .  it made me a bit angry!
wow .  do think he had bad intentions?
well     _comma_      she was attractive and at the time     _comma_      i thought he was thinking that too .  but     _comma_      i know now he was just trying to help her get to a safe place     _comma_      since she was falling down .  but     _comma_      it was hard to see it at that time lol
i understand . 
i had a bad morning when i went to check my mail . 
oh man . i hate checking the mail . it could be something crappy
especially when you find your mailbox laying in about    pieces after someone knocked it down last night .  
oh god  do you live in the country?
not really .  i live in town _comma_  but it s a small town . 
then the person might be caught _comma_  do you have a camera? that is really crappy of someone! i have seen people put metal or wood pallets next to their mailboxes because of people doing stuff like this
that s a good idea .  i might do that .  we don t have a camera because we don t normally have any troubles . 
it s a good idea to have one just in case .  murders _comma_  robberies etc happen even in small nice towns .  just for your safety 
my aunt came to visit today _comma_  we went out for mexican food!
that sounds nice .   did you have a good time?
yes  _comma_   kind of upset she was only able to stay in town for a few hours  _comma_   she is on a road trip!
that is a shame .   at least she made a stopover!
i have a big exam for college coming up _comma_  i have been studying day and night . 
what s the exam on?
it is for my molecular biology class _comma_  i feel pretty good that i am going to ace it .  
i wish you good luck!
i went and saw a hockey game today _comma_  it was really exciting . 
that s really cool! was it your first game ever?
no _comma_  i use to play growing up .  i haven t been to a game since graduating highschool .  
well i think it really cool that you were able to get back into something that you used to do when you were younger!
i was on a run today _comma_  and saw a loose dog but couldn t catch it before it ran off!
that s so interesting because i saw someone post the same thing on a neighborhood app just today .   is that you? ha ha . 
maybe if you live in central texas . haha! but i was so worried about that small dog getting hit!
ha ha _comma_  guess you weren t the one .   that would ve been crazy!  i hope its okay!  i m sure someone will try to grab it . 
i got some bad news today _comma_  my dad passed away . 
oh my goodness thats terrible _comma_  i am so sorry!
thank you _comma_  i am a mess .  it is still hasn t hit me that he passed away . 
i can imagine! my dad is my best friend i would be devasted
its so quiet in my house _comma_  my husband is out of town for work .

oh no!!  the ghosts are coming!! yeah turn the tv up loud :d
i got some great news today! my husband got a better paying job offer!
holy cow that s awesome!!!  what are you going to do with all that extra moneys??

that s pretty cool!  congrats!!
my daughter is in highschool but took a college course this summer and got an a!
i am so amazed by her! 
that is very good .  you should be proud of her . 
i ate way too many sweets today! 
theres always tomorrow!
thanks! being on a diet is hard _comma_  espically with family in town!
you can do it!
i was running today and felt like this car was following me . 
that s really creepy . 
yes it was _comma_  i think i need to start carrying pepper spray or something
also some kind of sound alert .  you think you could scream for help during those times _comma_  but a lot of people actually don t . 
im watching the show the bold type _comma_  my favourtie characters dad died :(
is that a good show? i have never heard of it
yes _comma_  it s a great girly drama! reminds me of sex in the city but modern . 
nice! what channel?
it s been a great night! i m just relaxing with a cold drink and my favourite show!
that does sound like a great night! i think i m overdue for one of those myself!
yes defenitly _comma_  it dosen t get better then this! my daughter has been fast asleep since  pm . 
that s great .  it s nice when we get some peaceful time for ourselves . 
my family is moving from texas to arkansas in a few months _comma_  im worried for the change . 
that is a big change!  are you moving due to a job or something like that?
my husband is getting out of the army and moving back to his hometown where he has a few job offers! big changes coming . 
yes  _comma_   that is definitely a big change .   i hope you settle in quickly though   change like that can be a drastic lifestyle upheaval  _comma_   but it could also be the best thing ever!
i recently moved into a new home .  
nice .  do you like your new neighborhood?
yes _comma_  there are a lot of kids that our daughter can play with .  
that is great .  why did you move?
we had been saving for   years to buy a bigger house .  we had outgrown our other home .  
i had a doctors appointment today . 
i m not a fan of doctors most of the time   how did it go?
i was so mad because i had to wait a hour after my appointment time before they called me back .  
i cannot stand that   they should not schedule people so close together if they can t handle that pace . 
i agree! everyone was so annoyed because we were all waiting forever .  
i had just moved in to my new apartment _comma_  and every night this skinny little tabby came begging for food at my door . 
aww   did you feed the cat?
at first i tried to resist _comma_  but i ended up adopting him!
that s how we have our cat also   how funny!  they are just irrestible at some point aren t they?
i received a wrong number call last night at   in the morning .  
ugh!  i m assuming that it woke you up?
yes! it was so aggravating .  they would not believe me when i kept telling them it was the wrong number .  
oh my goodness!!  how irritating!  i hope they didn t call back?
she did twice before she finally believe me that there was no bret there .  
i recently found out that i am having baby number   . 
no way! congrats! i m having twins sometime this coming week
wow! that is great .  we were thrilled because we didn t know if we were going to have anymore and nature just decided for us .  
that s nice! kids are great
yes they are .  they make life worth living .  
halloween is quite a big holiday where i live .  people get really in to their costumes!
i ve always loved halloween! some people get crazy creative!
it s peoples creativity that makes it so entertaining .  last year i went as a plague doctor _comma_  and everyone agreed it was terrifying!
that s awesome! now that i have kids _comma_  i have even more of an excuse to go out and check out what creative ideas people have every year . 
last year we lost our home of    years to a house fire .  
oh no!  i can t even imagine that   was everyone ok?
yes _comma_  thankfully everybody was safe .  nobody was even home when it happened .  
i m so glad that everyone was ok .   but i know that was devastating   did you rebuild?
no _comma_  we just bought another house closer to town .  it was sad losing everything that we had .  
when me and my friend got lost in the desert _comma_  i thought we were done for . 
scary! how long were you lost for?
only a couple of hours .  we flagged down an old chevy truck and the man driving got us sorted out . 
oh good .  i was imagining days
i went tonight to meet my daughters teacher .  
do you think she will be a good teacher for your daughter?
yes _comma_  i think she will be a great teacher .  she showed us her plan for the year and i think it was great .  
a good teacher makes a huge difference in how well the child learns and how much influence the parents are allowed to have   i hope your daughter has a great year . 
thanks so much .  i completely agree .  
i just finished watching the saw movie .  
i just cannot watch horror movies!!  did you like it?
i hated it! i didn t want to watch it but my husband did .  the gore is just too much! 
oh i am right there with you!  the last scary movie i watched made it where i couldn t sleep that night . 
yep! i feel kind of sick to my stomach now from watching it .  
i recently went down memory lane was looked at all my high school yearbooks .  
oh yeah?  do you still look awesome like you did back then?
well .  maybe not as awesome .  lol but i do try to keep in shape .  it was good seeing all my old friends .  
yeah i bet .   do you still keep in touch with any of them?
i do a lot of them but some have moved away and we just lost touch .  
yeah .   maybe you should hit them up on fb for a reunion?
that s a good idea! 
i bet you all would live it up and have a blast!
i had this guy flag me down today after leaving the store .  
what did he want?  it s kinda scary when that happens _comma_  you never know what they want . 
i was scared at first and then he hollered and pointed to the top of my car and i had left my purse on it .  boy _comma_  did my face get red .  
well a good samaritan after all!  i m sure you were embarrassed _comma_  but also glad that you didn t lose your purse!
my daughter just bought her first car on her own .  
nice! what kind of car is it?
it s a      mustang .  she worked the last two summers to buy it .  
well deserved! i hope she enjoys it to the fullest!
she is super excited to start school now and show it off .  
i m leaving tomorrow to go on vacation! 
hey that s awesome!  where ya goin?
we are going to daytona and orlando for    days .  
holy cow that s awesome!  that s gonna be a fun    days!
i sure hope so! we ve been planning this trip for a year .  
cool!  have fun and be safe!!
my husband and i have a fun weekend trip planned soon .  we are going to go to the casino for the weekend _comma_  just the two of us .  we are really looking forward to it . 
that s a nice getaway
yes  _comma_   it s been awhile since we had just some time for us .  plus  _comma_   we love blackjack!
have fun!!!!
i have a very good friend and her live in boyfriend of   years hit on me! i m married _comma_  and he didn t care .  he sickens me!
yikes that is pretty horrible
yes _comma_  i was really surprised and i find it terrible behavior . 
just seems so inappropriate and disgusting
we went on a vacation a few weeks ago  _comma_   and it really made me think back to our last vacation .  it was with my father  _comma_   the last one before he passed away . 
oh wow _comma_  i hope you cherished your time with him . 
i did   _comma_    but of course   _comma_    wished i had more time .  he passed away unexpectedly   _comma_    so i was going over that vacation in my mind too .  i miss him . 
sorry that that happened to you _comma_  i hope you re doing well . 
i was pleasantly shocked the other day when i won on a lottery ticket! i hardly ever win and i won     !
what did you do with the money 
i just tucked it back for a rainy day .  but  _comma_   i may splurge with it this weekend  _comma_   since it was unexpected . 
that is smart .  how often do you play the lottery 
my husband sure did surprise me with his handiness and hard work around the house last week .  he was able to accomplish so much work in a few days!
k
ok
i was the first person to receive a pretigious award at my college after years of the award being on offer . 
that is great .  where is the award displayed?
at the department office back at the school . 
cool .  will you leave it there forever?
one of my coworkers really ticked me off one day .  she decided she would delegate some work to me by slamming on my desk and demanding i do it .  she had some nerve!
did you get mad at her?
yes  _comma_   she doesn t have the right to do that .  i have been that many years longer than her  _comma_   and it was her work! i let her know it too . 
hopefully she won t do it again . 
one year my cousin wasn t going to get her young son anything for christmas .  it broke my heart so my husband and i bought his santa gifts that year . 
that was very nice of you . 
the little guy deserved a christmas and we really loved him . 
that is showing the christmas spirit . 
when i went to the fair last year  _comma_   i tripped on a large cord they had going across the walkway .  it was a long  _comma_   running fall! i wanted to hide!
did you hurt yourself?
scuffed knees _comma_  but mainly my pride .  i was also in front an attractive guy i knew so it was even worse . 
he probably forgot about it already . 
my husband and i are at a point in our lives   _comma_    we are able to save   _comma_    afford all that we need and save for retirement .  i m so appreciate we can   _comma_    as i know many aren t able to do that . 
you must of been hard working . 
yes   _comma_    we have been working hard   _comma_    as well as not always getting all the extras we would like at times .  but   _comma_    it s worth having some financial freedom!
that is great news .  congrats . 
one day at work while i was pregnant   _comma_    i fell! luckily   _comma_    the baby and i weren t hurt   _comma_    but i wanted to waddle away so fast!
oh no!  i bet that was embarassing :(
yes _comma_  it really was quite so!
i m glad you re okay .   did you have the baby yet??
there are times i feel a bit alone and down .  my husband has to travel out of town for work quite often . 
do you not have friends?
well    _comma_     yes    _comma_     of course .  but    _comma_     that isn t quite the same    _comma_     is it . 
true _comma_  but better than nothing . 
my children recently started school again and it made me feel a bit apprehensive .  they are growing up so quick _comma_  and i know it won t be long before they sadly move out of the house :(
oh man well at least its a good thing to see them grow
for sure! but _comma_  it flies by before you know it .  i get my nerves on edge when i think about them all moved out of the house . 
thats fair enough
despite working until a few hours before _comma_  i scored highly on the act the first time i took it back in high school years ago . 
wow that s impressive!
thanks .  i thought i d do poorly because i was tired . 
that s what i thought when i did it but i got a    . 
not that long ago _comma_  my husband planned a secret trip for us! i didn t have a clue he was doing it and was pleasantly shocked .  it was so much fun!
where did he take you to?
we just took a weekend trip to tunica  _comma_   ms .  we stayed at a really nice casino hotel and just played some blackjack  _comma_   enjoyed good food and each other s company!
i love tunica .  did you win at blackjack?
i lied to my mother one day about where i was going .  it made me feel pretty bad and have a bad conscience .  
oh no .  hy did you do it?
she didn t want me going with that friend  _comma_   but i wanted to go  _comma_   so i lied to her .  i was much younger then . 
did she find out?
i won a free trip to florida .  it s not the best vacation _comma_  but i ll take it for free . 
why wasn t it good? florida sounds like an ideal destination . 
i ve been to florida many times before so it wears on you . 
i know what you mean but hey like you said _comma_  it was free . 
i won a lottery for a small amount of money . 
awesome _comma_  are you a millionaire now?
no _comma_  i wish .  it was only a few hundred dollars . 
at least you won something though .  i ve never won anything from the lottery . 
a good friend of mine moved away recently and we lost contact .  i really wish we would still speak . 
i know how that feels .  maybe try reaching out . 
that s a good idea .  maybe i ll try that soon . 
sometimes you have to be the bigger person
someone was speeding on the road and i got into an accident with them .  my car was totalled because of their carelessness . 
dang that s really annoying .   is your insurance going to cover it?
yes _comma_  but not as much as the car was worth and it wasn t an enjoyable situation . 
yeah dealing with an accident is one of the most aggravating things . 
i let a friend watch my dog for a week while i was out of town .  i would ve been devastated if anything happened to him . 
trust your god feeling _comma_  everything will be alright
i hope so .  i ve only had my dog for a short time and this is my first time away from him . 
did you buy all the essential items the dog will need? 
i have been feeling great about life recently .  my relationships have been going very well
nice! are you married?
i am not _comma_  but i have a person i am very fond of .  are you?
i am forever alone .  however _comma_  i hope you continue to have great relationships and a great life!
i got a surprise gift in the mail yesterday . 
wow! what was it?
a gorgeous vase .  it s so pretty .  i have no idea who sent it .  
i d like to see this vase .  do you like flowers?
yes _comma_  i love flowers .  i can t wait to fill it up . 
my sister broke my vase .  i was pretty enraged!
what did you do ?
i scolded her but then told her it was okay _comma_  but it s not the biggest deal!
yea thats true
i m am upset today because my daughter who lives really far away called and said her baby was admitted to the hospital . 
oh no .  what happeneed
he was premature so he s been having some breathing issues .  i hate not being there . 
ah i hope it all turns out well for you all
i m so taken by the talents of contestants on the show face off    have you ever seen it?
i have _comma_  thats a very cool show
their abilities to both imagine and create their characters is incredible!
they are very talented on there
a lot people know toys r us has completely shut down not long ago . 
yea i remember it seeing go away a few months back _comma_  sad . 
yeah _comma_  a lot of my friends and i got to thinking of all our memories there .  really makes you think back . 
yea those were the gold ole days
i feel so bad _comma_  i forgot my sisters birthday . 
oh no _comma_  i am sure you can make it up to her
yes i plan on it  _comma_   its just been stressful time at home with a toddler  _comma_   it slipped my mind
well you have busy _comma_  it happens
i love my husband so much i could never cheat on him . 
love is a great thing _comma_  i am happy for you
yea  _comma_   i wouldnt want to hurt him  _comma_   i cant understand anyone who does . 
yeah _comma_  people can be unpredictable sometimes
it can be really tough when your husband and teenagers have electronics .  
you need to take them away!
i do for family time but sometimes i can sit in a full room and still feel no one is there
yea i just take them away and let them cry it out . 
tomorrow is my husbands birthday!
that is great!  do you have anything fun planned for him
yes _comma_  we are going out for a nice dinner .  we haven t been on a date in months!
that sounds like a good birthday .   i hope you guys have fun
i love the holidays _comma_  that make think back to being a kid . 
ah same here .  if only we had more holidays in a year!
yea _comma_  that would really be great .  or maybe we d get bored . 
i guess we ll never though unless something monumental happens _comma_  and we get another holiday . 
there is a big storm going on in my town right now!
o? same here .  i love storms . 
i don t _comma_  it makes me nervous with the strong winds and rain! 
be careful and don t go outside then . 
my favorite game has an expansion on monday _comma_  i can t wait . 
nice! what game?
world of warcraft _comma_  it s been my favorite for years . 
oh cool  _comma_   i ve heard of it but never played  _comma_   i m not too good with games . 
i just got a promotion at my job! 
i am happy for you .  what kind of work
i work in human resources for a big company _comma_  i wasn t expecting the promotion! feel blessed :)
that sounds like a nice job
i really like every shelf in my house to be arranged just so . 
i feel you! do you have everything facing the right way?
i do  _comma_   everything is in it s place .  it thoroughly bothers me when someone puts random stuff on them  _comma_   like cups or papers . 
oh well  _comma_   it happens though  _comma_   don t be too hard on people!
i just found out my husband is cheating on me . 
that s terrible .  do you know how long it s been going on?
a few months _comma_  i m not sure what my next move is .  staying in a hotel for a few days to think . 
i m so sorry to hear that .  what did he say?
my daughter is finally fully potty trained!
good for her! she must be quite proud of herself . 
yes _comma_  i am very happy as well! no more buying diapers haha
oh gosh .  diapers are really expensive .  i forget all about that . 
so _comma_  my new puppy is adorable though maybe not as amazing yet as yours . 
oh they re all amazing in their own ways!
she s so cute and fun _comma_  i love her already . 
what breed is she?
i started doing more research on salaries for the degree i ll have in   months . 
nice .  how much do you expect to make?
it seems to be about    _comma_     per year just out of college .  i am eager to see if the statistics are correct .  
that s a pretty good sum of money .  i hope you start there as well!
i know it s silly  _comma_   but my friend got something i wanted in a game the other day  _comma_   bit sad . 
we re all human so having a feeling like that is understandable . 
i guess _comma_  little things at times right?
yea _comma_  i m always surprised at how much i sweat the little things . 
i watched the lion king today with my daughter _comma_  reminded me of my childhood . 
thats a good movie _comma_  cant wait for the live action version coming out
yes! i m excited for that as well .  i watched the movie with my mom when it first came out!
thats  awesome
opps .  ok _comma_  i mean that i was sad the other day because a friend is moving . 
is it far away_
not to far _comma_  but it s still sad to see her go . 
well you can still hang out since its not far
i have been having a rough week!
are you glad its over?
yes but i am afraid i might loose my job . 
i am sorry _comma_  any backup options?
i hate how our country is right now . 
why do you say that
people just can t seem to get along _comma_  makes me sad . 
that is very true sadly
i spent all weekend alone _comma_  wish my family lived closer . 
i know what you mean .  my family is     miles away
my family is over    _comma_      miles away in alaska  _comma_   its tough!
i feel for you .  it really makes life tough when you can t just take a drive down the road and see them . 
my husband woke up with his face swollen and a terrible toothache
that s horrible .  did he get to go to the dentist yet?
not yet _comma_  but i was his bedside nurse all day .  anything he needed i was sure to get . 
that s very kind of you to be there for him like that .  
ah _comma_  it s been rough .  my dog passed away two nights ago . 
oh no that s awful .  i am sorry for your loss!
thank you _comma_  she was    years old so i knew it was coming but still shook up about it . 
yes _comma_  we can never be truly ready to lose our babies like that .  i have been through it several times .  at least they are happy and pain free now . 
i hate when it storms so bad the power goes out
me too .  it worries me that all the food will spoil and my animals will get overheated
i agree . 
does your power go out alot where you live? it only happens a few times a year here thankfully
i found a hundred dollar bill when cleaning my closet!
wow .  do you remember losing it?
no! i m not sure where it came from! and i live alone :o
that s weird lol
there was a huge spider on my wall _comma_  it ran away before i could kill it . 
i am so afraid of spiders
me too _comma_  i think it was a wolf spider .  i hope i can sleep tonight
i have no idea what a wolf spider is .  it sounds terrible though
i m so nervous _comma_  have a final exam on tuesday!
do you think you ll do well?
yes _comma_  i have been studying a lot but still worried .  i need to get a good grade!
what class is it?
i have to give a speech on thursday . 
are you prepared?
yes .  but mentally i am never ready to give a speech if im being honest . 
i relate _comma_  what is the speech on?
it s on local politics .  not a fun subject either!
i sold some stuff i didnt need last week . 
did yo make some good money?
yea _comma_  enought to have great weekened anyway . 
i cold use some money like that
i think that my husband and me have so much faith in each other . 
thats awesome to hear _comma_  a lot of people cheat on each other frequently and dont care anymore
i know _comma_  i cant do that .  i think it s very important to be honest in your love life . 
i believe so too  _comma_  if people are gonna cheat why get married at all
ten years ago now _comma_  a massive hurricane forced my family to evacuate .  i didn t know if there would be anything to come back to . 
that s awful _comma_  but better safe than sorry .  how were things when you came back?
pretty messed up _comma_  but the house was still standing . 
that s a silver lining in all of it at least! 
was travelling    hours internationally .  first flight got delayed and the airline would not apologize and provide altenative
that s terrible .  i thought they had to offer some sort of alternative .  what airline was it?
british airways .  they claimed because they dont have ties to the connecting _comma_  they could not
i ve never trusted british airways .  
i ve felt excited when i found out i had won a place on a prestigious creative writing course _comma_  taught by someone who i knew could help me in ways that i would i not be able to through self study alone . 
you are so lucky to be talented enough to achieve such an honor .  was it as wonderful as you had imagined it would be?
thank you for the kind words .  you know what? it was  _comma_   but not for the reasons i imagined! it turned out that everyone in the class developed a really close bond and while the advice from the teacher was wonderful  _comma_   it was the lifelong friendships and mutual edits that the students do for each other that has proved equally special! 
sounds like it was a once in a lifetime experience . 
i think it was :)
i like going fishing _comma_  it reminds me of when i would go with my dad when i was a kid . 
do you have any kids?
i do _comma_  i have a   month old boy .  how about you?
i have    i bet you can t wait to take him fishing . 
i dropped all my food in the cafeteria the other day .  everybody was staring at me . 
was it at college?
no _comma_  it was at work . 
oh wow! did you get it all over youself?
i once accidently ran down the battery on my car when i mid judged how long i could run the radio for without the engine running .  it was  am and i was in the middle of nowhere .  i called the first person i could think of who could help and they came with crocodile clips and recharged the battery .  i felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a kind act .  i was also embarrassed that i had let that happen and i learned from it! 
that sounds like a really stressful situation .  it s really good to know that there are still helpful people out there!
yeah for sure! it was one of those things that once it happens once then you definitely know the limits of the car s battery power without engine running   so you make sure it won t happen again!
i m glad you ve put a positive spin on it :) 
i m ready for college football to start .  i can t wait for kickoff weekend!
who do you support? 
auburn tigers
cool .  do you play football too?
i did something really foolish at the grocery store yesterday . 
oh no! what did you do?
i was reaching for some pasta sauce and knocked a few of them over .  they shattered on the ground a such a huge mess that two workers had to come mop it up . 
oh yikes! that s a bummer .  i m sure the employees see that kind of thing all the time _comma_  though . 
i can t believe he did it! i just went to my brother s graduation ceremony at princeton . 
oh that s super excited! i m sure you re really proud of him . 
oh yeah _comma_  definitely! he put in a ton of work and it all paid off!
that s super great to hear! well deserved . 
i once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags .  it turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine .  the two bags i had had some expensive dj equipment but they were very heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags i trusted him! he didn t disappoint _comma_  he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one   all down to trust!
what a nice guy .   there are fewer and fewer of those every day . 
it s one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like  am so i m sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier .  
are you goings going to stay friends?
i was really mad when i walked out my door the other day to go to work and my neighbors big dog jumped up on me and knocked me over . 
did you get hurt?
yes _comma_  i hurt my back and couldn t even go to work .  shouldn t the dog be on a leash .  ugh!
i hope you get better soon!
my transmission in my car went out the other day _comma_  maybe it won t be too expensive to repair . 
that s never fun!  large unexpected expenses are the worst
yes they are .  i had just put a down payment on a house too _comma_  so my money is tied up . 
oh no! at least you have something to look forward to _comma_  the new house!
i am fuming .  i saw someone key my car while i was at the grocery store the other day . 
oh no! what a terrible thing to have happen! were you able to confront them?
no _comma_  i was checking out when i saw it happen .  i didn t even know them .  i don t know why anyone would do something like that . 
that is just awful .  now you ll have to pay to have it repaired .  
had my first trekking expereince in the canyon last week .  it payed off using all the things i learned during the scouts when i was small!
nice .  did you like it?
i did .  the scenes were really rewarding .  also felt good to have all the tools and skills necessary 
that is nice . 
last week i saw a three piece rock band that sounded so huge that i was sure they were playing with a backing track .  i asked their tech _comma_  and checked their equipment and guess what!? it was just them!
it was who _comma_ who were them?
i m sorry if i was unclear _comma_  i mean that the band were playing completely live (with no backing track) . 
ok _comma_ thats amusing
so i learned to bowl using two hands yesterday and it was my best game ever!
wow! thats great! i bet you feel proud of it!
yes _comma_  very! it s also way more fun for me to put spin on the ball than traditional style bowling . 
i bet you were full of joy and laughter yesterday! 
so i came home to dog poop everywhere yesterday! it was gross!
oh no! were you gone for long?
we were only gone for   hours! you just can t leave them alone i guess
what a bad doggie .  hopefully they don t do it again
i am starting a new phase in my life .  completed all debt and off to a new start
i can hear the sigh of relief in your voice .  i bet your anxious about what the next chapter will be .  
yes very .  but i know that it will be good .  
i can tell your proud of yourself .  im happy for you!
thanks! i hope to learn from my mistake and continue to progress
you will be fine! stay optimistic about it
i try to be .  it can be difficult on some days _comma_  but i think i have a good attitude towards most things
i agree _comma_  but having great joy in life helps
i m feeling very motivated and good about school this year .  i think i can get much better grades this time . 
it s good you re motivated! that s a step in the right direction
thanks! i ve realized that school is extremely important and i can t squander my opportunity away . 
i agree .  i wish i could go back to school and pay more attention
my friend bought a house in a very cheap market town and   months later a very walthy company opened an enormous regional hq there .  his house has doubled in price and he has paid off all his debt and now is very well off .  i m pleased for him but envy a little luck
that s amazing and a very quick profit!  i m a little bit jealous myself .   
yeah .  it is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!
it s amazing the effect something so seemingly small  _comma_   like the company headquarters opening  _comma_   can effect an entire town like that
so yesterday i went bowling and the ball got stuck on my hand .  i went with it . 
yikes .   did you get injured?
no _comma_  but i was shocked at how a small    pound ball can carry you down the lane due to the momentum .  it was quite funny . 
yeah and the lanes are really slick .   that s pretty funny and maybe a little embarassing too . 
my brother got a nice new toyota  runner for his first car! i m lowkey kind of mad at him for it . 
i would be too! that s a really nice car for his first car!
no kidding! i hope he understands the value of it!
i do too .  maybe he will left you drive it!
i just got a new car and i absolutely love it! my old car was a piece of crap so an upgrade is awesome!
wow you must be so happy! nothing like a new car
i am very happy! it s nice to know that i don t have to worry about if my car is going to start or not either . 
having a reliable car really changes things for the best
i was listening to a throwback hits playlist and it brought back memories from the good ol days . 
nice! what genre of playlist was it? 
it was mostly hip hop and r&b .  stuff like nelly furtado  _comma_    pac  _comma_   etc . 
cool! i like to rediscover old playlists i made when i was younger . 
my grandson was admitted to the hospital the other day .  it s so hard waiting around for test results . 
i can only imagine! how is he now?
they still have more tests to do .  hopefully they will know something by tomorrow but it s so nerve wracking . 
doctor s are good at what they do! i hope for a speedy diagnosis and recovery!
i am so excited   after a year of misery due to my loud _comma_  inconsiderate upstairs neighbors i m finally moving into a new apartment!
that is great news!  i bet you are glad to get a fresh start somewhere new . 
i just can t wait! i ve seen the new place   _comma_    and it backs onto a forest   _comma_    so there ll be peace there   _comma_    at least!
it is always exciting to move into a new place and make it your own
yes it is .  and friends are going to help me with moving .  it ll be great fun   we can have a bit of a party while they help me unpack :)
i was bowling last week and i accidentally used the person s custom ball that was next to me!
oh  _comma_  how he reacted next
it was a she! and she just glared at me .  i felt awful when i realized my mistake . 
its ok it happens with every one
we have a family reunion planned for next week .  i am really looking forward to catching up with everyone _comma_  especially my brother and sister . 
yes _comma_  that will be awesome! how long has it been since you ve seen everyone?
it s been over a year and we don t get to talk very often because everyone is always so busy .  i m so excited . 
that s fantastic that you get to see everyone again! i hope you have a great time catching up . 
i recently hit a new personal record at the gym! i was very excited . 
that is a great accomplishment .  i admire your dedication in obtaining that goal . 
thank you! i didn t feel like i would ever be able to do it _comma_  but consistency does seem to pay off . 
it s really hard to stick with something like that .  i wish i could do it . 
i have a feeling that the rest of this year is going to be great to me! i m already working out and just have good vibes about the upcoming months . 
that great to hear! have you started a work out program before?
i have but i ve never really stuck to it .  this time is different though _comma_  i ve been going for a few months and feeling great about the future
you can do it! don t forget to reward yourself for all of your hard work!
my brother got a custom made bowling ball _comma_  and ever since then he s been killing the game! it is awesome to see . 
sounds impressive _comma_  does he mainly play for fun or is he in competitions?
he s on his high school bowling team _comma_  but i think he mainly plays for fun .  it s kind of cool seeing him get so much better over time . 
very nice _comma_  i would be proud too . 
ok _comma_  so the people upstairs were making a terrible noise last night and i d had enough .  i put jazz on quite loudly and went to bed .  i really shouldn t have done that!
oh no what happened?
well    _comma_     they were shouting and stomping around    _comma_     so i lost it! this morning    _comma_     they ve been quiet as church mice    _comma_     so i guess it worked :)
that would really help if it was a permanent solution
yeah  _comma_   i really do feel bad  _comma_   but it s been going on for over a year . 
yeah enough is enough .  i totally can t say i blame you . 
perhaps i ll try classical music next time   that might totally shut them up _comma_  lol . 
bwahaha not to mention it will help you get some relaxing sleep . 
i was watching my dad s house last week and i heard some odd noises while i was there alone . 
i hate creepy stuff like that because i get paranoid . 
no kidding! once i came back to the kitchen and the faucet was running even though i hadn t touched it . 
that sounds more odd than what i am used too .  hopefully nothing paranormal is going on . 
i didn t see my parents since     ! they live in a different country .  i m finally going to see them next week and i just can t wait!!
that will be an amazing trip!!
i know! and they ve never met their grandson so they will be so excited to finally meet him
that will be so great for them   i can just imagine meeting my granson for the first time   what a sweet time you are about to have . 
i can t help but think back to the good old days at christmas time . 
christmas was always a nightmare for me . 
i m sorry .  that makes me really sad .  we lived in a great neighborhood growing up and our neighbors were like family and always got together to celebrate . 
i cried every year knowing santa wasnt coming to my house . 
the last time i went into a job interview _comma_  i knew as soon as i walked out that i would be getting a job offer .  i felt i did really well . 
that is great! it s so awesome to feel confident after an interview!
definitely .  you go through so many it s easy to feel down . 
yes it sure is .  did you end up getting the job?
last winter i was out on my porch at   am .  suddenly a large figure dressed in black was walking towards me .  my heart was beating like a drum!
was it a ghost?
i wasn t sure at first and   _comma_    being in a wheelchair   _comma_    had nowhere to go .  then the dark figure stopped in front of me .  i thought i d had it .  turns out it was my neighbor who couldn t sleep   _comma_    walking her dog!
oh _comma_ that was so hillarious
it is now .  but it sure wasn t at the time .  i was frantically looking around for something to beat my  attacker  off with!
i stress eat a lot .  i decided i need to control it and i didn t eat sweets for more than a week .  very proud of myself
that s great _comma_  keep it up if you can!
i ll try to do my best .  i think i will also need to see a doctor .  i just don t wanna get obese
it s good that you re being more proactive about your health now . 
my co worker just bought a brand new car .  
man _comma_  i wish i could get one . 
i know _comma_  me too .  i really envy them every day when i get in my beat up chevy that i ve been driving for    years . 
i also drive a chevy and have had it forever as well . 
i wanna sell my phone so i posted ad on craigslist .  i have   potential buyers but i m so scared to meet them  .  you never know what people intentions are
have you ever sold on craigslist before? i always have the people meet me in the walmart parking lot during the day .  i have sold hundreds of things and have never had an issue like that .  
i did but my husband was with me and now he is out of the country for a couple of months so  i will be alone
it will be okay .  you could also have the people meet you at the local police station .  the police do not mind and would rather you feel safe . 
i am moving into a new apartment in three weeks and can t wait .  it ll be quiet as it looks onto a forest!
is it loud where you are now?  new places are always so fun!
not with traffic  _comma_   but with the people upstairs   they re a cross between hyenas and elephants! .  my new place was quiet when i was there  _comma_   so fingers crossed!
oh that will be such a huge relief i m sure!  it s crazy that people behave that way _comma_  knowing they are causing other people such strife . 
they re the most selfish  _comma_   inconsiderate neighbors i have ever had  _comma_   and i ve lived all over the world! i just cannot wait to get into this other place . 
someone stole my identity . 
oh no! how did that happen and how much damage did they do?
i don t know .  they completely cleaned out my bank account and maxed out my credit cards .  i am fuming . 
that is horrible! what will you do?
i have food on my table _comma_  a roof over my head and clothes to wear .  i m happy and thankful
that is truly all you can ask for . 
yes .  some people take these things for granted .  it s really easy to take things and people for granted
i try to never take anything in life for granted .  
so i decided to make a blanket and i got a sawing machine and got patterns and stuff .  it tuned out to be so easy! i actually made   blankets
wow _comma_  impressive .  you must have natural talent .  do you plan to make more? 
thank you! i do want to take more and to give them to my friends who recently had babies
you can always sell them as well .  i live in amish country in pa and the amish sell blankets for hundreds of dollars each . 
i remember being in scotland and arranging a trip to california to see my then boyfriend .  i was so very happy to be seeing him again!
i bet! is it hard to have a long distance relationship?
very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and facetime .  we spent a fortune on telephone calls .  but it was so worth it to speak to each other and i was lucky i could afford to fly out to see him . 
i can only image how hard that was before the days of smartphones! i m glad you were able to visit him!
me too .  that was one of the happiest trips of my life .  the happiest was when we got married six months later!
when i spend time with my family _comma_  it reminds me how lucky i really am . 
aww .  it s the things money can t buy that bring us the greatest joy _comma_  no?
definitely .  even when times get rough  _comma_   there are still so many things to be thankful for .  i did not always realize that  _comma_   but glad i do now . 
that is so true and it s a good perspective to have . 
my dog just gave me a bunch of kisses! i love her so much
dogs really are such great companions _comma_  what breed is she?
she is a golden retriever .  do you have any pets?
yes i have a miniature pinscher _comma_  he just turned    . 
school starts a week from tomorrow and i am getting fairly nervous for it!
how come? it will probably be an exciting adventure for you to start
oh yes _comma_  i really like school and my classmates and stuff! i guess just because summer is coming to an end?
the summer is horrid .  heat    _comma_     sweat    _comma_     mosquitos    _comma_     rain    _comma_     and crowds everywhere
i always say i m not a judgemental person but in my head i judge everybody and i m so ahsamed of it
i do the same! i think everyone does . 
yes but when i catch myself judging somebody i feel so guilty and bad
i think it s a normal human activity .  you don t need to feel bad
i ve already gotten my school supplies and everything is ready! i feel like i m gonna kill this semester . 
that s the way to do it!  be prepared to kick it s butt and get good grades!
i will try! it will be hard with a part time job but i bet i can manage . 
always put your school first _comma_  you will be thankful you did later!
my brother just turned    and he s about to get his first car! i m so excited for him . 
whoa that s exciting!  what kind of car we looking at?
probably some kind of suv _comma_  maybe an xterra or  runner .  should be awesome when he gets it!
that s a really good safe first car . 
i ve been saving up for a new car for the past month and am making great progress!
thats awesome!  what kind of car do you want
i want an suv _comma_  like an xterra or  runner .  they are pricy though!
well i really hope you are able to save up and get it soon!
recently my husband and i were traveling home from visiting his family when all of a sudden a car cuts us off
that s annoying _comma_  i hate how little attention most other drivers pay on the road . 
i have no idea how we didn t hit them but it was so scary
i m glad that you are okay! keep your eyes peeled for terrible drivers . 
my oldest child s birthday is next week and it always makes me emotional . 
i can imagine .  how old will they be?
she will be    .  it makes me feel so old _comma_  but also how fun it was when they were little . 
yeah but also just think of all the amazing movies she has done .  
i feel so much better about myself and life in general now that i
now that you what? tell me!
sorry _comma_  i accidentally hit enter haha .  now that i ve been working out for about a month!
oh that is great! i ve heard that exercise can really help mentally and physically!
i just enjoyed grocery shopping for the first time in a very long time .  i ve found my perfect restaurant store and spent a very happy    mins or so wandering around it . 
that s great! did you get anything you are especially excited about? it s a restaurant and a store?
yes  _comma_   it s both .  i got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local indian lady made .  and a bag of dragon tongue beans  _comma_   which are delicious!
dragon tongue beans! i ve never heard of them! what do they look like?
they re the same shape as regular green beans _comma_  but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them .  you treat them as you would green beans . 
i will have to look for those .  we have a huge variety of foods where i live _comma_  but this is new to me .  
what i love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic .  so you get some strange _comma_  different things to try!
it sounds amazing! are the prices good?
i came home from work last night and my step dad scared me!
how did he scare you?
like he jumped out from behind a door and scared me .  i was not expecting it!
i bet that gave you a good scare! gotta love dads and step dads!
my step dad showed me a cut he got while working on his boat and i could see his muscle fibers .  i almost puked . 
oh that sounds disgusting! 
yeah it was gross .  he probably should get stitches . 
i hope he gets that taken care of!
when i heard anthony bourdin had taken his own life  _comma_   i was so shocked and upset .  he gave so much pleasure to a lot of people  _comma_   yet was miserable in his own life . 
i think we never really know what is going on inside people s mind .  celebrities like anthony and robin williams seems to live a good life  _comma_   but in reality  _comma_   they are suffering . 
it s awful .  i really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!
i completely agree! i think it would even help lower crime rates . 
most definitely .  we actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve . 
all around   _comma_    it would be a good decision for society .  just last night   _comma_    i was watching live pd and there was a young man stealing a candy bar .  he was a drug addict .  i believe if he had the help he needed   _comma_    he would not have to steal tiny amounts of food . 
there s so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations   it s disgusting . 
i hadn t been able to see my grandmother in quite some time b c she lives so far away
oh no .  i m so sorry .  can you video chat with her?
well i was finally able to go and visit her and the house and visit was exactly as i remembered it as a child .   it gave me such great memories!
how wonderful .  that s what s important and makes life meaningful in my opinion . 
i remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an f  race .  i caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place .  my mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? i said      to   .  by the time we were back at the hostel _comma_  i learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport s history!
wow! that is insane _comma_  too bad you didn t bet with those kind of odds . 
yeah  _comma_   for sure! it was one of those nights where we were journey is what s fun rather than what you were aiming to do  _comma_   if you get me .  we went from sports bar to sports bar trying to see who would show the event and by the time we gave up we d had such a funny night and the race had turned out great!
that sounds like a great time _comma_  one of those nights you always remember!
i didn t know until the other day that kids have different teachers for different subjects starting in  th grae . 
yeah the older they get the more teachers they usually get .  i think it s good because they get a variety . 
that s true .   i was a little startled b c i don t remember changing classes for things until  th grade .   just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now . 
yeah schools definitely start things younger now .  kindergarten used to be voluntary back in the day!
that s true   when i was in kindergarten _comma_  we only went for half the day . 
when i lived in california my farmer friend and landlord had me get organized and have all my valuables together in case of a big earthquake .  he stockpiled such things as batteries and water . 
i can understand that as i live in florida and we prepare for hurricanes each year with a plan and emergency rations and supplies . 
it feels good to get everything together _comma_  doesn t it? you feel as if you re ready for anything!
yes  _comma_   you are correct .  you can always  hope  for the best  _comma_   but also  plan  for the worst .  being prepared is a comfortable feeling . 
i like that saying   it s very good advice .  i m all for advance action as it saves headaches (or worse!) later on . 
i m so proud of my son! he learned a couple of words this week .  he now knows how to ay please
that s wonderful _comma_  they say children have a certain gift for picking up languages . 
he actually speaks   languages .  i teach him english and russian
wow! that s impressive and a lasting skill for your child to develop . 
a while back my loud upstairs neighbors went away for a week .  my life went from night to day .  it just felt as if all was right in my world . 
did you think about moving after that?
funny you should mention that   in three weeks time _comma_  lol . 
haha are you serious? did you move in with your girlfriend?
no  _comma_   moving to a   bedroom apartment .  i don t have a girlfriend   i had a husband  _comma_   but we split up . 
i found a cat in my attic yesterday!
oh wow! i hope that it was ok!
my husband is allergic to cats to _comma_  i m not sure how it got there .  we had to call animal control to get it out safely!
oh no .  that sounds really stressful!
my best friend s long term relationship ended abruptly a while back   _comma_    just after her father passed .  i m so full of admiration for her   instead of turning to drink or becoming crazy depressed   _comma_    she pulled herself together and made a new   _comma_    exciting life her new reality . 
that is very unusual .  she should be proud of herself . 
yes  _comma_   she should .  she joined a community garden and helps out there  _comma_   she got a part time job and took up badminton   not something she d ever done before!
wow _comma_  i wish more would follow her example .  that s a recovery . 
she s a very strong person and she also has lots of friends and family to help her .  she s a lovely person and deserves the best in life!
i just got hulu live .  it s been amazing to watch tv again!
i haven t watched actual tv in sooo long .  what do you watch on hulu?
i love to watch home shows on hgtv and bachelor in paridise on abc .  hulu live has been a great value for the price!
that s real neat  _comma_   i might check it out .  i ve only ever used netflix  _comma_   but netflix is pretty good too . 
my husband ran over a cat this morning on accident _comma_  i m so upset . 
aw _comma_  i bet he feels horrible about it .   poor kitty!
yes _comma_  we had to call animal control to retreive the body! i hope it wasn t someone pet . 
aw  _comma_   that s always sad  _comma_   i lost a cat once and i assume that s what happened to her ;(
i couldn t imagine losing all   of my kids in a fire . 
that would be horrific .   do you know someone that this happened to?
yes _comma_  i heard about it .  such a sad story . 
that is just horrible .   i think they would have to medicate me for the rest of my life if that happendd . 
my friends threw an unexpected birthday party for me .  i thought they d forgotten . 
that is nice of your friend .  i hope you enjoyed it . 
i did! it was a very nice gesture . 
you can return the favor one day .  that is what friends are for!
we are waiting on military orders right now _comma_  i m so hoping they come through next week . 
do you have any idea where you will go? is it accompanied?
yes _comma_  we know where we are going just haven t gotten the official orders . 
well i hope they get there soon so you don t have to wait longer . 
i get so tired of hearing about people being mean to animals . 
i m with you on this one .   what is up with people these days _comma_  i just don t understand how they could do that . 
right _comma_  these poor animals have no clue why people are mean to them .  some people are heartless . 
i think there should be stiffer penalties for people that do things like that _comma_  for instance more jail time . 
for some reason i ve been thinking of our family christmases back when i was a kid .  i so enjoyed decorating the tree  _comma_   helping my mom with preparing lunch .  and of course  _comma_   eating christmas lunch! fun times . 
i had a similar experience _comma_  i miss it too
it s nice to think back  _comma_   tho  and relive the old days .  we have our own traditions now  _comma_   but the good old days will always remain just that!
i totally agree
it s funny  _comma_   we always remember the successful  _comma_   fun times and forget about the not so perfect things .  must be our minds  defense kicking in! 
do you know anyone who spends a ton on eating out every week? it s crazy to me how much they spend . 
i know that when just the   people in my family do go out  _comma_   it runs us about     .   so we do it very rarely  _comma_   it wastes a lot of money . 
yes _comma_  exactly .  a friend was telling me they spent almost      a week on eating out .  i don t even spend that much on groceries .  
a week!?  that is just crazy _comma_  and pretty irresponsible unless you are a millionaire . 
we are moving soon and i m so ready to go . 
where to?
texas _comma_  there s so much to do there so i m happy for the change .  
i spent some time there _comma_  when i was learning how to be an army medic .  i really enjoyed my time there!
awesome _comma_  my husband is air force and we have been in mississippi for   years .  texas sounds better . 
i was worried because the weather man said a hurricane was coming .  so we got everything ready just in case . 
it s better to be safe than sorry .  you can t overprepare . 
so true .  luckily it didn t get as bad as they thought so we didn t have to evauate . 
i am glad you didn t get hit .  i know how stressful hurricanes can be . 
my cousin contacted me the other day via facebook messenger .  she had my twin aunts with her _comma_  one of whom i hadn t seen in over five years .  it was such a delight to see them and chat with them!
i bet! i hope you were able to catch up!
oh yes _comma_  and then some! they both looked so well and had lots to say .  what a laugh we had .  i m so fortunate to have such a wonderful family!
you are very lucky!
yes i am! when i hear how some families are i feel very blessed .  they are very special people . 
my dog has to have her teeth cleaned on wednesday and i am really nervous b c she got super sick last time afterwards 
that s strange _comma_  i hope she makes it out ok this time though . 
she is super tiny and they said with small dogs the stress of the procedure will give them stomach issues sometimes .   i wouldnt even do it except she has an abcess
oh wow _comma_  i would never consider something like that hurting a dog . 
recently my grandma passed away .   she lived pretty far from us most of our lives but at the end she had alzheimer and so we moved her down to be near us
i m sorry to hear that .  i hope she passed peacefully . 
yes  _comma_   it seemed so .   i really had fun reconnecting with her as an adult  _comma_   so it was really hard when she passed . 
i am sure she appreciated your visit before her passing .  she must have felt loved . 
we broke down and couldn t get help for several hours as we were out of cell range .  good thing i had packed extra food and water . 
that was a really smart call on your part! were you worried?
i was very worried but we were lucky eventually and someone stopped and helped and we went on with our vacation . 
well _comma_  it was a very smart thing you did packing those extra supplies . 
i ve been so busy packing _comma_  packing and more packing .  
that sounds pretty stressful .  are you moving soon?
yes _comma_  don t know exactly when but i hate being rushed so i ve been doing what i can . 
that makes sense .  i hate leaving things for the last second as well .  hopefully you won t have to leave everything boxed up for too long . 
i recently got married to my best friend .  we are older now and are happy with things being low key and staying on a routine . 
that is great! you are lucky!
i do feel very lucky _comma_  especially to find someone who is as satisfied as i am in our old age . 
it is a wonderful thing that you have someone to share your life with . 
i got to hear a lot of cool songs on a radio station i usually don t listen to . 
nice! which ones did you hear!
mambo     _comma_   missy elliot  _comma_   and ricky martin .  it really took me back
that one is a zinger! i remember listening to that when i took my grandma to prom!
i took a test for college the other day _comma_  it was basically our midterm . 
how did you do?
i don t know yet .  the wait is killing me and i m not confident i did well . 
im sure you did fine .  what was the subject?
discrete mathematics 
i was watching the scottish open golf tournament a few weeks ago .  i know a guy who was playing in it .  guess what? he won! fantastic four days of baited breath and cheering him on!
that is great! can you call him and see if we could all celebrate together?
he s playing in the pga championship right now or i m sure he d be delighted to _comma_  lol!
well yeah  _comma_   that sounds about right .  he has to go to the championship first and win  _comma_   then party time !!!!!
you got it! i ve been watching him play for a while now and it s such a fantastic feeling to see him win   and in his own country too!
it is really could to see friends live out their dreams! i will be cheering for him and the team!
thank you   he d appreciate it .  it makes tournaments so much more interesting when you know some people involved . 
i love teaching people how to skydive   it is so much fun helping them to learn . 
that s sound like a lot of fun! do you know where i can go get lessons?
there are skydiving centers all over the world .   what part of the country are you in?  it is an amazing sport . 
i am in va .  i have been looking into it for quite awhile _comma_  but i think i d be too chicken to jump out of the plane . 
there is skydive orange and virginia skydiving center .   i grew up near richmond!
everyone in my family laughs at me b c i am super organized and i like routine in my life
nothing wrong with that .  i m definitely with you on the organizational front .  i bet they re not laughing when you get them out of a jam!
exactly!  i always joke that i use to be a boyscout b c their motto is  always be prepared 
it drives me nuts when people are disorganized .  my husband is hopeless   i could throttle him sometimes!
you know when you see the perfect house to rent and someone beats you to it? that happened to me recently   the owners rented it out the night before i was to see it :(
oh man that is really annoying!  have you found another one you like yet?
yes _comma_  but it s an apartment and this place was a lovely quiet   bed   bath place in a lovely neighborhood .  such a bummer!
oh man i would be so upset .   i totally understand!  i hope you will be able to enjoy your new place
i m sure i will so long as i have good neighbors .  i m over the first place now _comma_  but it wasn t pleasant to be pipped at the post!
my horse died last week i was devastated when i found out
oh no! do you know why?
yeah the vet told us it was cancer i was really sad
aw _comma_  i m sorry .  i hope you get another horse that can at least help to replace that hole!
i am always outside my house beafore my friend gets here
do you know he is coming _comma_  or is it just blind luck?
i know he is comming i just like to be there couple of mins before he arrives
that is very considerate of you _comma_  i bet he really appreciates that . 
i was really happy the day i finished my doctorate
wow .  that is quite an accomplishment! congratulations!
yeah it really took a lot of hard work to do it but it was worth it at the end
what was is your doctorate in?
in science of medicine it was really a fun exppirience
my wife has been out of the country for   months _comma_  and is getting back in a week .   i m super pumped!
what has she been doing? undercover cia agent?
no _comma_  taking a language course to help her graduate studies .   good guess though :p
 wink   wink  
my wife is coming back into the country after being away for   months .   i ve got to do some cleaning before she gets back :p
ha _comma_  yeah gotta make sure the house is back up to wife code before she gets home .  other wise there s going to be a price to pay . 
most definitely .   i m not worried about her being terribly mad _comma_  but it s nice to come home to a clean house . 
it always is _comma_  plus it gives you some brownie points as well . 
i burned my hair with my hair drier i am so embarrased to go out in public
i am sorry to hear that _comma_  my wife has done the same thing .  she wore a hat for almost a month when she left the house . 
yeah it is the worst _comma_  i loook so weird with my hair like this it is so embarassing 
well   _comma_    like i told her   _comma_    it will grow out   _comma_    it will just take time . 
i had a bad experience out to eat the other day .   i don t do it too often _comma_  so it was a bummer . 
that doesn t sound good .  what happened that was so bad?
the food was pretty bad and the service didn t help clear things up .   there were a lot of mistakes on top of everything .   just general bad eating out things . 
that sounds like an awful experience .  i probably wouldn t go back there anytime soon . 
i was walking through the grocery store the other day and wasn t watching where i was going and knocked over an entire display . 
oh lord .  did you try to set it back up _comma_  or did you try to sneak away?
it was too much of a mess to clean up and i couldn t sneak away because there were several people who saw me do it .  my face was bright red . 
oh no _comma_  that s really embarrassing! hopefully they let you off easy since it was just an accident . 
my wife has been out of the country for two months and is getting back in a week . 
i know you re happy 😊
definitely :)  it s been a long and lonely summer :)
i feel ya _comma_  lonely indeed . 
i recently moved from california to north carolina and suddenly realized i knew absolutely nobody .  it was a horrible feeling . 
that sucks .  why did you move from california?
my rent tripled in three years .  i couldn t afford to stay   just too expensive .  anyway  _comma_   a friend had driven across with me and it wasn t until he d gone that i realized i was alone .  silly  _comma_   huh?!
that s really common actually .  there s a big exodus from there .   they voted for high taxes and now people are abandoning the state beacuse the cost of living is too high . 
the two things i found that were really bad were rents and gas .  everything else was pretty much the same as other places i ve lived .  so sad   where i lived was lovely . 
the weather is nice in parts of california _comma_  i ve been there . 
the north is my favorite area   north of san francisco .  where did you go?
my sister got married at laguna niguel
a while ago i drove from florida to northern california .  it s a long trip _comma_  but i knew i could do it just fine . 
that is a long trip .   did you do it all in one go or did you take breaks?
it took about   days .  i would drive a few hours and stop for the night .  i d already made the trip from west to east _comma_  so kind of knew what i was doing . 
that s not bad _comma_  i was thinking you were doing it in like a couple days . 
oh no   i m not a race car driver   _comma_    lol .  and anyway   _comma_    it s kind of fun seeing different parts of the country   _comma_    so rushing would (to me) be a waste . 
my wife was really sick the other day _comma_  she was stuck in bed for most of the day . 
oh  _comma_   poor lady .  i do hope she s feeling better .  what was wrong with her  _comma_   if you don t mind my asking?
not completely sure  _comma_   maybe just a stomach bug or something .   she s ok now  _comma_   though her appetite took a bit to come back . 
well _comma_  i m really glad to hear she s recovered .  stomach bugs are awful   they really take their toll on you . 
summer was so boring for me _comma_  im really happy school is starting again
why was it boring _comma_  nothing exciting to do where you live?
not really _comma_  i just stayed home all summer because my parents worked the whole summer as well as i did
ah yeah _comma_  that sucks .  no time for anything fun . 
my mom is having weight loss surgery next week _comma_  i m nervous . 
what kind of operation is it? i m unfamiliar with weight loss surgery .  but typically surgeries like that are very safe _comma_  but it is natural to feel nervous about someone you care about . 
she is having gastric bypass surgery _comma_  i feel like it would be too dangerous due to her medical state .  she wont listen to me!
well _comma_  everyone is entitled to their own life choices .  i m sure she ll be alright . 
there is nothing i hate more than losing in something
yeah _comma_  that s never fun .  did you lose at something recently?
not recently but gettting last at a race really makes me angry and motivates me
i agree _comma_  it makes you just want to try harder next time . 
it has been a wonderful monday!
that s great _comma_  what specifically has made it so good for you?
i found out a got a pay raise at my job _comma_  we are starting to plan a cruise for the holidays in november!
wow that all sounds very exciting _comma_  congratulations!
i read in the news about a family who lost all six of their animals in a house fire :(
thats so sad oh no! thats terrible .  :( 
i know _comma_  it made me upset! my two dogs are my babies couldn t imagine loosing them . 
they are honestly just like children so its really sad .  
my dog is over at the vet for   days and makes the house feel so alone 
awww _comma_  i totally know that feeling .  i hate even going on vacation and not being able to bring my dog along .  she is family!
yeah i am really looking forward to getting him back
i can imagine! is he doing okay?
my wife went out of the country for a couple months at the beginning of the summer _comma_  dropping her off at the airport was really tough . 
it must have been! have you guys been apart before?
not for more than a few days .   it s been a rough couple months _comma_  but it s almost over!
ah so you ve gone through it a couple of months alrready .  how much longer is she going to be away for?
when my wife and i had to move for her to go to school _comma_  we had a lot of trouble finding a place to live until my parents were nice enough to cosign on a loan . 
you must be so thankful!
we are .   they ve helped a lot during my life _comma_  but this might have been the biggest one . 
they are really wonderful .  do you have plans to show how thankful you are?
i cant wait to visit my family back home they are so far away i dont get to see them a lo
when will you be going ?
in a couple of weeks i am really happy to see them it has been   years
wow _comma_  i hope you have a really nice trip . 
i cant get near spiders _comma_  even if i see them in pictures they freak me out
just cause of the way they look or you had an incident involving one?
not really i was just born afraid of them hahah
yea im right there with you on that one along with snakes heh
a few years ago  _comma_   before we got married  _comma_   my wife planned a party for me for my birthday completely without me knowing . 
that sounds like a pleasant surprise! 
it really was!  i walked into my apartment to like    more people than i expected . 
thats so sweet of her and what a great memory to have! 
i hate when my little brother throws food on the table just to annoy m e
that s a terrible waste of food _comma_  how old is your little brother?
he is like    but he does it when my parents are not home it is really anoying
well _comma_  i hope he soon sees that is not something that he should be doing . 
i was stopped at a traffic light when a woman in a truck scraped slowly along the side of my car . 
that s brutal _comma_  did she get out?
yeah  _comma_   we both stopped and pulled over .   i think she was high or something  _comma_   she was really off . 
did she have insurance?
i found a little ball of hair when i was eating at a fancy restaurant
awful! did you complaint?
yeah i did _comma_  they gave us a refund and we did not come back to that place again
food should be made hygiene .  we shouldn t compromise on health . 
i had made plans for dinner and had set everything out and i found out my husband ate all the bread! 
that s annoying _comma_  was it garlic bread?
it wasn t even garlic bread! it was generic bread to dip in soup! 
what did you say to him after he did it?
i feels surprised
how so?
my boy friend gives me a birthday gift surprisingly 
that s awesome!  i love getting surprises!  
my neighbor used to have an old beagle   a lovely pooch .  he died of cancer just before thanksgiving .  i looked for him for weeks   i miss him . 
that s so sad .   i ve lost dogs before .   i know how you feel :(
yeah .  i used to see him when i was out on my porch and he d come out for a sniff around or a tinkle .  he was so sweet and gentle . 
yeah dogs are man s best friend . 
they sure are .  i actually prefer them to some humans i know! do you have a dog at the moment?
yes i ve got one .   she s a stray that showed up to work one day . 
that s wonderful _comma_  that you were able to take her in .  good for you! more people should act like that . 
she s been a great dog .  i ve got no complaints or regrets . 
i m not a very good cook but sometimes my husband scares me with it!
oh wow haha that s not good
he was putting chocolate right into the chilli the other night! 
that s an interesting combination _comma_  maybe you should try to keep him out of the kitchen
my son came home today and was working on his homework . 
what grade is he in?
in  th and they re doing pre algebra .  he said he didn t know it _comma_  then proceeded to get every question right!
awesome! that had to be a great confidence boost for him! 
i ve been training hard for a marathon next week _comma_  and i am beating my record time!
that s amazing! how long have you been running?
for a few months now _comma_  but i ve been training pretty hard just these past few months . 
that s pretty cool .  i hope you win!
i m very socially awkward and tomorrow i m going to have a playdate with some local moms and i m so anxious
i m right there with you .  i still feel pretty introverted    _comma_     but since coming to college    _comma_     i ve been forced to socialize more    _comma_     and it s help me at least  fake it until i make it .   i still prefer to be alone a lot of the time    _comma_     but at least i can somewhat manage without making myself look dumb .  maybe you can just think of some topics things to talk about to have in the back of your head for the times when things get quiet?
that s a great idea! thank you for a great advice .  
i hope it goes well! if it makes you feel any better  _comma_   most of them are probably just as nervous and are looking for any excuse to relax and let their guard down  _comma_   too .  good luck
i recently went to ruby falls _comma_  an underground cavern with a waterfall .  
that sounds awesome .  have you ever been before?
not that particular one _comma_  no .  i had butterflies in my stomach on that elevator going down    stories . 
i wish i could go sometime that sounds like quite the experience . 
overall it was a good time  _comma_   but i was nervous being that far underground  _comma_   i need to learn to relax and enjoy things . 
i had some hesitations when i was at the gym today _comma_  thought i wouldn t be able to handle the weights
how d it turn out? congrats on deciding to lead a healthier life _comma_  by the way . 
i decided to focus on the music that was blasting  _comma_   just tried switching up what i play in the gym  _comma_   it sounds like vikings are bringing me into battle
i m the exact same way in the gym .  music is a huge motivator for me .  one time my phone died while in the gym and the rest of the workout was so low energy . 
have you ever been in a car crash before?
yeah i have _comma_  it wasn t serious but i got rearended
i got t boned once  _comma_   i ll never forget spinning around in that car  _comma_   hearing the tires squalling .  it was really scary . 
that s terrifying _comma_  i m so glad you re okay
my wife has been really sad here recently _comma_  i ve had to hold her while she cries herself to sleep at night . 
that is very sad .  did something recently happen to her? 
shes lost a lot of loved ones this summer .  we ve been to   funerals _comma_  and the most recent one was really hard on her . 
that is absolutely horrible .  i hope she has a moment of happiness very soon .  no one should have to deal with that much loss .  
my bank _comma_  which i ve had a savings account with for over    years has been deducting     month from me for  inactivity  .  how about that?
death by a thousand cuts _comma_  i call it! they ll try to make a buck off anything!
very true .  they didn t even tell me .  that was the last thing i expected! i only just decided to use it again . 
did you try talking to them about it? i can only assume it wouldn t go well but you never know . 
yes .  they said that they d been taken over by another bank and it was the previous one which deducted the money .  what rubbish .  it just amazes me!
have you ever had a friend or loved one commit suicide . 
yes _comma_  i have .   one that actually died and one that was miraculously saved .   it was a dark and tough time .   did that happen to you recently?
yes _comma_  my brother in law childhood friend took his own life .  its been very hard to comes to terms with . 
i am soo soo very sorry .   its so hard to understand everything surrounding a suicide so its hard to be at peace about something that didn t have to happen .   i pray you and your family will find closure and fight for awareness for people who are struggling with those feelings . 
have you ever had a new puppy?
yeah _comma_  i have .  do you?
yeah  _comma_   he keeps pooping in the floor! he s learning to go outside  _comma_   but i m so tired of stepping in doggy poo at  am!
it happens .  hope your dog will poop outside soon . 
i store my chocolate in the fridge to make sure that it stays cold and solid .  i was storing my last piece in there
always sucks when you forget to save it and wake up to a melted blob of brown . 
last night i wasn t in a great mood and wanted that last piece to help cheer me up a bit and it was gone! 
oh wow! i hate when you get the urge to eat something and then you get to the fridge only to realize it s gone .  do you know who ate it?
i ran into my neighbor s mailbox with my car but didn t stop and leave a note . 
thats horrible! you should tell them as that is their property .  what if someone did that to your stuff?
i agree  _comma_   i felt so bad about it .  when i saw him replacing it  _comma_   i went out and confessed . 
good on you!!
i m so stressed .  we are struggling financially and i don t even know how are we going to pay rent this month
i know how you feel _comma_  financial problems are rough .  i know you ll figure out a way to make it . 
thank you for your support! and to make things worse i broke a ceiling light yesterday and we are renting this apartment so i have to replace it and it s expensive
that really stinks! don t worry too much though _comma_  things will work out . 
my mom made a pretty awesome scrapbook and gave it to me for christmas several years ago .  i recently dug it out and went through it . 
that s awesome _comma_  what was in it?
photos from my whole life growing up _comma_  with sections about my relationships with each sibling .  pretty awesome . 
you must be happy to have it back _comma_  those are the best memories . 
i once was taking a big trip i had been looking forward to and the day before we leave for an international flight a high level travel advisory was issued for the area we were going . 
ugh! i hate it when stuff like that happens .  were you able to get a refund on your tickets?
no .  we went ahead and went on .  it actually turned out to be a great trip with zero incidents .  
awesome!!
yeah .  glad we didnt bail . 
that is very true! was it bad weather?
no .  best i can remember it didnt even rain . 
i hate it when plans fall through .  i really wanted to spend my time on the water this last weekend . 
i hate that too _comma_  what were you going to do?
i was going to florida to go on a multi day canoeing and camping trip .  at the last minute  _comma_   the two people i was going with backed out  _comma_   and i simply couldn t afford to go alone . 
maybe i could come with you _comma_  i m near florida . 
my grandpa always said he was a rockstar back in his day _comma_  but i never believed him .  
why don t you believe him? he made have been quite the big name back in his day . 
i don t know if he was famous    _comma_     but the other day    _comma_     he got on stage    _comma_     bit the head off of a bat    _comma_     then belted the words to crazy train .  it was unbelievable!
wow _comma_  that sounds amazing .  i wish i could have seen that!
i used to do flooring work _comma_  we had to deal with some pretty strange situations sometimes .  
that sounds interesting .   what kinds?
well _comma_  one time we had to replace the subfloor where a man had died and his cats had started to eat him .  was revolting . 
oh that s awful!
it really bothers me that my son sticks his dirty socks in the toy box
is that like the child equivalent of under the bed?
i guess so haha but no matter what i try to keep him from doing it _comma_  it still happens
that s kinda strange .  i assume that s something he ll grow out of .   how old is he?
i recently had my hip length hair cut for the first time in years . 
wow _comma_  that took some guts! what made you want to cut it?
it was kind of scraggly on the ends .  it took me some time to get used to the new cut _comma_  but it looks much thicker and healthier now . 
and just think about how much you re saving on shampoo and conditioner!
i went around work all day today with a hole in my pants _comma_  right on my bottom . 
ahhhh! i ve done that before _comma_  but i noticed it quick .   did you not know til the end of the day?
yep! no one told me .  :( i have no idea how many people noticed or saw it .  
that s embarrassing  _comma_   ah  _comma_   i m sorry .   just play it off tomorrow at work! 
i paid       for one of those mystery boxes on ebay .  it said it would be filled with all sorts of fun and expensive items . 
please tell me it was not full of oriental trading company rubber ducks and cheap tchotchkes . 
i would ve happily taken that! instead  _comma_   it was filled with literal garbage  _comma_   like a bunch of those empty    bananas bottles and candy wrappers . 
oh man! i feel bad for laughing but  literal garbage  is pretty funny .  that sucks _comma_  can you report them to ebay?
i had my final exam for chemistry today!
how did you do?
i m pretty sure i aced it! i ve been studying for weeks . 
that s good .  i was never good at chemistry
it can be rough when i have a problem and need to vent to someone
i understand _comma_  anything you need to talk about?
you are sweet because part of the problem is when i realize there really is no one to talk to .  thank you
buck up little camper . 
i ve been training a new girl at work this week!
how is she doing
she s doing great _comma_  especially for her second week on the job!
i am happy for you and her
i ve already been shopping for christmas _comma_  i m excited!
i can t believe christmas is in   months it s crazy
i know _comma_  it s my favourite time of year! makes me happy :)
mine is the fall .  halloween _comma_  thanksgiving . what s not to love . 
i was just at the casino _comma_  spent almost     dollars on a single machine .  i didn t will anything . 
well the casino won! did you at least get some free drinks?
haha  _comma_   yeah i got a little sauced .  the worst part though was as soon as i got up  _comma_   someone sat down and  rolled triple  s . 
hah .  at least you had fun it sounds like
i used to get supremely scared when i wanted to go up stairs when the lights were off
i do hate when the lights are off too
yeah _comma_  so i would book it up the stairs as fast as possible
i am sure i would too .  just be careful
i just got matched up with someone online .  it will be my first date in a while . 
i am happy for you .  are you excited?
yeah _comma_  i m really hoping to make a good impression .  other wise that would feel pretty bad . 
i bet you will be fine .  just be yourself
tomorrow is the big day _comma_  i have to deliver my proposal to the client . 
are you ready for it?
i have been preparing for weeks _comma_  but in the back of my mind i still have doubts . 
i am sure you will do well
my boyfriend s cat wakes me up every morning at   am . 
that must be annoying for you _comma_  but i love cats . 
i love him   _comma_    too   _comma_    a lot .  but i don t know why he just stands in the hallway and meows nonstop   _comma_    even when he s been fed . 
what is his name?
ashe .  he s cute :)
i m finally almost done with my associate s degree! i technically started wayyyy back in      _comma_  but i just got serious in      . 
oh that s great! congratulations on your upcoming finish!
thank you .  :) i only have three classes left to take .  i m so excited .  
that s amazing .  i wish you the best of luck with the remaining classes!
thanks a lot ;)
playing hookey can be really fun .  but sometimes it backfires . 
ohh what happened?
when i was a teenager _comma_  i called in to the restaurant and told them i had to pick up my grandmother from an aiport hours away .  wouldn t you know it my family came in (including my grandma) and asked to be sat in my section!
sometimes things like these happens .  don t worry .  but playing hookey is a fun though
sometimes i enjoy being alone _comma_  but not on a long trip that takes me far away from home . 
i know exactly what you mean .   it gets so lonely on the road .   have you had to go away recently?
this was a while back  _comma_   but i planned a bicycle trip that went across several states .  although i had a buddy coming with me originally  _comma_   he ended up bailing and i went alone .  i called it quits halfway . 
that s still quite a long ride .   do you do a lot of long distance biking? 
i have a beautiful girl friend .  but i met someone else . 
on to the next one _comma_  as they say!
i m trying to figure out how to kick her out of my place . 
have the new chick there when she comes home
i just watched the ring movie for the first time . 
oh yeah .   i ve never seen it _comma_  i can t watch horror films .   how did you like it?
i can t even sleep with the lights off now for the last few days . 
ohhh boy .   i hope you have a person or an animal to snuggle up to to help you feel better . 
once i took a sip of iced tea while i was driving and it went down the wrong pipe .  i had to pull over so i could try to breathe again . 
that s scary when that happens
yeah it is .  i thought i was about to die lol
some people do die from choking _comma_  be safe!
my cashier gave me extra change back and i didn t say anything . 
why is that?
because i had also stolen some candy and wanted to get out as soon as possible . 
oh that makes sense _comma_  well be careful
a man came to my door with a gun _comma_  asking for money . 
whoa _comma_  that is scary! did you know him?
i did not know him .  he took some items from the house as i didn t have any money on me
i am glad that you are okay!
i like finding little resources or tips that change old habits i ve been coping with in what seems like    easy step 
hahaha _comma_  sounds kind of like clickbait
exactly   _comma_    i started taping my mouth closed at night   _comma_    finally woke up before noon   _comma_    mission accomplished
hahahaha _comma_  that s so funny
i started taping my mouth closed before bed  _comma_   and now i m no longer tired when i wake up  _comma_   feels like i am born again
that is weird but amazing! does it work?  if it does _comma_  i will get my husband to tape his mouth shut .   he snores like a freight train because his tongue slides back i guess .   is that true for you?
yeah _comma_  it
do you have any advice on what kind of tape?
i use band aid tape cuz it s okay on the skin
sometimes life just hits you on the head with a good time .  like the other day when i went to the park with my girlfriend . 
that sounds like a nice time!
it was   _comma_    but not just because of a romantic walk .  when we arrived   _comma_    there was a festival with games   _comma_    performances and a fireworks display after sunset! it was incredible!
wow that worked out perfectly
i was trying to study for a final but my neighbors were being really loud _comma_  and i had a hard time focusing
did you go over and ask them to turn down the volume?
no _comma_  i m shy and try to avoid confrontation as much as possible
well _comma_  i hope you have some really good earphones   or that they quiet down   it s a big egotistical to think that no one around you cares when you are that loud . 
i really should have switched banks a long time ago .  nobody over there knows their head from their butt!
i know what you mean .  once i had a bank where the teller s literally had butts for heads .  it was so distracting trying to talk to them . 
that sounds truly bizarre! i guess i am still angry because the other day they froze my card _comma_  and due to a teller s mistake actually had to take my current card and mail me a new one!
well it was an upgrade from the bank i had where the tellers were actually robots .  i can t believe the cost cutting measures in place today!
i went to a bar i used to go to in college _comma_  and i was surprised to see an arcade machine i built with a dear friend of mine!
wow  thats nostalgic!! .  it must have brought back lot of good memories
yes _comma_  playing the machine we built together reminded me of all the good times we used to have . 
does the machine is in good condition now?
i hadn t been to the dentist in five years but made an appointment recently because of a toothache
what happened?
i just started to feel a sharp pain in one of my teeth .  it might be a cavity or something worse
are they going to pull the tooth?
i can t believe i am telling you this _comma_  but i actually camped out to buy tickets for the new star wars movie . 
thats not strange at all
i m glad you don t think so .  the kicker is _comma_  when i got to the front of the line the guy in front of me got the last two tickets!
that sucks .  what did you do?
my girlfriend and i were going to a big parade with some friends .  as we were leaving _comma_  she tripped on the stairs and hurt her ankle . 
oh no _comma_  the poor girl .  was she able to walk afterwards?
unfortunately  _comma_   it swelled up and she was in no shape to go anywhere .  so instead  _comma_   i stayed with her and watched netflix while we split a pint of icecream . 
you re a terrific partner .  you guys can do something outdoors next time _comma_  right?
my cat jumped through the window in the basement and it was the most shocking _comma_  but ultimately underwhelming thing
hahaha why was it underwhelming?
i guess because furry things don t really scare me _comma_  i was like well that was a waste of a reaction
lol how do you feel about spiders?
i was getting mad at the weights in the gym to see how much i could lift
why were you getting mad?  were you not lifting as much as you wanted?
no not really _comma_  just seeing how much energy i could summon from within
i see _comma_   i do that too sometimes .   it helps with motivation
there s too many things to think about
you are good at generalizing aren t you?
yeah _comma_  what am i getting myself into
i have no clue .  really i don t!
i just finally won some money playing scratch lotto tickets . 
how much did you win?
close to      _comma_       _comma_   i think i m going to spend it on traveling . 
thats sounds like a fun trip or  
i went to a play recently that was unconventional in a really fun way .  it actually took place at a pool . 
that sounds cool . 
it was an adaptation of  the last unicorn  .  it had parts that took place in the water _comma_  and parts that took place on a giant trapeze!
wow .  i would love to see something like that
i got a new puppy .  she s really cute and playful
what did you name her?
i named her layla . 
thats so cute!
i recently went to a steely dan concert with my lady . 
oh you must have enjoyed it!!
yeah _comma_  it was awesome reminiscing about those times when we used to get in trouble back in the day .  times were so much simpler then . 
yeah indeed it must have been then
i just got a new puppy _comma_  names fido . 
so cute! what kind of dog is it?
it is a german shepherd .  it takes a lot of work caring for it _comma_  definitely needs a lot of attention
that s amazing  _comma_   i wish i could get a puppy too  _comma_   but my cat is not friendly
on my way to work  _comma_   a goose stole the toupee i needed to impress the new secretary  _comma_   christy . 
that s crazy did you ever get it back?
no! i am so furious with that goose _comma_  that i could wring his neck! i can t get any ladiez with this chrome dome of mine . 
i am so sorry maybe you will have better luck next time . 
i was doing the dishes and a huge roach crawled out from underneath the dishwasher . 
eww _comma_  it may be time to call someone to take care of them . 
i almost fell over trying to crush it _comma_  i forgot i wasn t wearing shoes and stepped on in with my bare feet . 
oh _comma_  that had to be super gross! 
i was walking down the street at night _comma_  i felt like i was surrounded by something unseen . 
how creepy!
every time i turned around to try and catch something there was nothng there .  just the feeling of something watching me . 
at least nothing happened to yo
i had a job interview that i didn t really feel prepared for . 
that s rough .  did you end up getting the job?
i did not get it unfortunately .  
well _comma_  there s always next time .  at least you can chalk it up as a learning experience . 
one time _comma_  i smelled an odd burning smell coming from under the hood of my car . 
that s strange .  what did you discover under there?
well   _comma_    when i went to lift the engine cover   _comma_    i noticed a dead   _comma_    rotting squirrel on top of the engine block! it was so repulsive . 
oh my! that is repulsive indeed! i would ve taken it home for dinner .  waste not want not!
i went to the store  _comma_   just trying to get some milk and bread  _comma_   and i got rear ended by a driver . 
oh no!  are you okay?
yeah  _comma_   it was more of a shock than anything  _comma_   was not expecting someone to hit you when you are just crossing the street . 
yeah i bet!  did they stop and check on you?
i have been working and prepping a powerful and moving speech . 
oh yeah? is it on par with  i have a dream ?
i can only dream .  no it s more on par with lord of the ring s final battle . 
woah now! i wasn t thinking of a speech on that grand of a scale! i hope you blow gimli s beard clean off his face and make    horns of gondor sound!
someone let me cut in line at the store so i could check out faster . 
wow that was really nice of them
yeah _comma_  i was in a huge hurry and didn t have much but i really needed to make it to the bank before it closed . 
most people now a days won t do that .  make sure to pay it forward!
i thought i bombed my math test but i got a     on it . 
that s great _comma_  man! did you study hard for it?
i reviewed all the homework and the test questions mostly had the same problems on them .  i didn t feel like i understood how to do the problems but i remembered the answers . 
well _comma_  that s all that matters! just gotta pass those exams!
i just found a photo book of me and my family growing up . 
aw  _comma_   that s awesome  _comma_   did it bring back memories?
it was pretty nostalgic  _comma_  how young we all looked growing up . 
yeah _comma_  it s always nice to take a look back and reflect on the early days . 
i finally got to see a baseball game live this last week . 
nice! who did you go see? did you catch a homerun?
it was the rockies  _comma_   no home run though  _comma_   it was pretty high up there i felt like i could see the world . 
that sounds amazing .  all i have is my lowly senators sea level stadium . i am mad jealous . 
when my buddy asked me to help him clean out his grandmother s house who had recently passed _comma_  i was not prepared for what we found . 
oh dang .  was she a hoarder? what did you find?
you hit it right on the money .  she was not only a hoarder but a cat lady  _comma_   and the mix of paper  _comma_   bugs and cat feces was an affront to the senses . 
i can t even imagine the stench . did you make out with any buried treasure?
i let my dad borrow my car and he got in a minor accident . 
oh that s terrible .   is he alright?
yeah he is fine and my car was not damaged .  my insurance premium is probably going to go up though . 
that really stinks that that happens .   are you pretty upset about it?
he said he would cover the extra costs so i m not too upset
when i bought my new car _comma_  i couldn t believe how smooth the ride was . 
i do love a smooth ride .  what kind of car is it?
it s a chevrolet camaro . 
that s awesome! i am mad jealous that you have my dream car!
i studied for   months to take the gre exam _comma_  it was stressful . 
wow  _comma_   you were dedicated  _comma_   did you do well on it?
i did  _comma_   and i was accepted to my number   program  _comma_   which meant that i was going to be paid to learn!
congratulations _comma_  all the hard work paid off!
i have a feeling the really hard work might just be beginning _comma_  but i feel exceptionally lucky . 
i studied all night for my final exams .  i needed to pass them to graduate from college . 
that must of been pretty stressful .  but did you get enough sleep?
i did .  i was able to sneak in a few hours here and there . 
sleep is just as important as studying hard .  you can kill your performance without it . 
i left my wallet in a movie theater _comma_  and didn t notice till i was half way home!
that s terrible! did you get it back with everything still inside?
i was able to get back in and find it _comma_  it was pretty well hidden in between the seats .  no harm no foul . 
at least you have a happy ending for that story . 
some people are just so generous .  really makes you feel like there is some humanity left out there . 
i agree .  i think i am one of them _comma_  considering i gave my whole life savings to charity yesterday . 
that s incredible if true _comma_  but i have trouble believing you for some reason .  i was talking about some stranger who gave my friend   free tickets to a rock concert   we had such a blast!
that s really great  _comma_   but i swear it was true! it was a whole    cents .  looking back on it  _comma_   i am kinda sad i did it because now i can t buy that fancy fidget spinner at the supermarket .  hopefully some orphan uses it wisely . 
i was so proud of my daughter over the weekend . 
that s good to hear _comma_  what did she do to make you proud?
she performed her first solo dance in competition _comma_  but she had been in leg braces for the last   years . 
oh wow! that s amazing _comma_  i m sure that was a really touching moment!
it was  _comma_   very much so  _comma_   i will cherish it forever . 
i m grateful for the work hours _comma_  but bummed that i can t get time off . 
sorry to hear that .  maybe you can talk with your boss about changing the schedule a bit . 
well  _comma_   i ve worked without a break for the last   years  _comma_   i just want to get away abit . 
wow  _comma_   that is a long time! that shows how dedicated you are to your job  _comma_   and that you deserve some time off!
right! i d like to go lay on a beach _comma_  or even just the next town over at this point . 
i have been extremely diligent in my studies so far _comma_  and am participating in two clubs this upcoming year .  the future is looking bright!
that is awesome .   what are you hoping to do?
i am an electrical engineering student  _comma_   and i am interested in quite a few things at this point .  i think after this year  _comma_   i will be able to get a paid internship next summer!
that s the dream _comma_  to get paid in college .   i wish i could have done that .   congratulations!
i am so tired of hauling garbage to the county dump . 
are you cleaning out a house or do you not have garbage pick up?
the company in my city just quit picking up for any of the residents _comma_  so the dump has a line every day . 
that is insane! i ve never heard of anything like that before .   you all should start protesting!
 we have  _comma_   and we called a city meeting .  i m just beyond words  _comma_  it has to be corrected . 
 s all too common these days .  |||| new conversation ||| i recently went to a dinner where we were served something unconventional to say the least . 
oh really? what was it they served?
i should have known better _comma_  as these friends are on the  crunchier side  .  they had a loaf of bread that they made with flour that had cockroaches added to it!
oh wow .  i really can t imagine eating it knowing it had those in it . 
i lost my appetite completely! i will be sure to get takeout before hand if we ever go to another one of their dinners . 
my mom is supposed to call me regarding her test results . 
i hope she hears some good news .  is it pretty serious?
she had stage   cancer _comma_  but she was clear last screening a year ago . 
i ll be praying for her _comma_  i hope she continues to stay in the clear in the future . 
thank you _comma_  i have a good feeling about it . 
i went to a wedding recently  _comma_   and something happened that put a damper on it .  i felt bad for my buddy  _comma_   but at least he knows he can trust me . 
oh no _comma_  it s awful something happens on that special day that should be full of joy and whatnot . 
yeah  _comma_   his wife got drunk and paid a pass at me .  i told her to sober up  _comma_   and let him know what had happened . 
yikes .  well  _comma_   at least you did the right thing by passing that long  _comma_   as painful as it might have been .  
i am highly upset that i m the only one concerned with earning money for our bills
am sorry about that _comma_  what are others doing about it
not much .  it s all on me .  it sucks
sorry _comma_  just tryy to be patient with them
i love playing old school video games .  the music is amazing
old school video games are full nostalgic memories for me .  that is why i try to avoid them as they evoke many emotions in me
for me it s happy emotions
it is just that i miss my friends a lot with whom i used to play .  i wish i could just rewind time and go back
the micro brewery explosion in america has been awesome for my girlfriend and i  _comma_   as we love craft beer .  until recently  _comma_   our town didn t have one though . 
i love beer! i wish i could try your guy s beer .   is it a hard process?
we actually don t brew our own _comma_  and hadn t been able to try many because we live in a small town .  but we just got the news that a micro brewery was opening here in a few weeks!
awesome _comma_  that s great news!  hope you guys make a great tasting one and become big!
i hate it when other guys look at my girl
ooh  _comma_   you should not be  _comma_   she should be appreciated for looking good
she s for my eyes only .  at least she doesn t pay them any attention .  or i would flip!
aha _comma_  thats funny though
everyone i have ever worked with in a kitchen has either already read  kitchen confidential  _comma_  or i have made them read it .  we were all devastated when anthony bourdain passed away earlier this year . 
oh  _comma_   i haven t read it  _comma_   but i was also sad to hear he passed
he started from the bottom and worked his way up .  he had a passion for people as well as food _comma_  and we all still look up to him . 
yes _comma_  too bad he was struggling with his depression and couldn t seek help
my husband and friends planned me a baby shower without me knowing . 
aw _comma_  that s so nice of them! was it fun?
yes _comma_  it was a lot of fun and it caught me off guard .  it meant a lot that they did it for me . 
that s great! it s so nice that you have people around you who care
i gave twin fawns in our yard some fresh peaches and they loved them . 
ohhh . i would love that experience! how special!
i enjoy helping the wildlife in our area .  it is alway a good feeling to give a helping hand . 
i love that too! i try feeding everyone :) awesome!
in a week my wife will finally be back from being out of the country for   months!
oh geez! why was she gone for so long?
she was taking a language course in germany for her graduate studies . 
that s pretty cool! that would be hard though! were you all able to talk a lot?
i m moving into another apartment and just told my neighbor i was leaving .  he said he was sorry i m going!
how long have you been there ?
about a year and a half .  i really didn t expect him to say that   we don t know each other that well . 
sometimes we affect people that we don t realize . 
very true .  i do pet his dog when i see them .  perhaps he recognizes a fellow dog lover!
ugh . my boss made me stay late yesterday  _comma_   so i had to work overtime  _comma_   but i didn t even get paid for it!
that doesn t seem fair .  how are they getting around not paying you for it?
i m technically salaried _comma_  so i don t get paid overtime .  it s still really irritating .  
it sounds like your boss needs to be more considerate when it comes to his employees . 
i went to my car one morning and found that some kids in my condo complex had thrown food all over it
wow _comma_  did you ever get them in trouble?
sadly   _comma_    no .   there s no actual proof of who it was   _comma_    but we ve seen them doing random stuff like that all over the place .   he did have the cops called on him for unrelated things once   _comma_    so i ll take that as a victory . 
there you go _comma_  take victories where you can get them!
my husband went to a job fair and got a lot of job offers!
great _comma_  what is his field ?
he is currently active duty army _comma_  but is wanting to go into transportation logistics .  
i see .  i hope for all the best for you and him . 
it s been a great day so far! the sun is out and i m on my second cup of coffee!
sounds super relaxing! i bet your enjoying it!
yes i am _comma_  about to make some soup for lunch .  this day has been just what i needed!
thats awesome! what kind of soup do you make?
when i applied for the job i have now it took them like a month to get back to me with a final answer .   it was pretty stressful . 
my brother just graduated and is on the job hunt  _comma_   and he s described his experience as the same thing .  seems like he has good interviews and they re receptive to him  _comma_   but they don t really respond or give him an answer .  sorry to hear you guys go through that .  can t imagine how frustrating it is
super frustrating .   it worked out in the end _comma_  but i had to bug them a few times to make sure they hadn t abandoned me . 
good on you for being aggressive and opportunistic .  maybe they found that to be the motivating factor to give you the job .  i hope it s been good so far . 
a friend of mine took early retirement recently and he and his wife are traveling all over the world . 
that sounds like so much fun!
i know   i wish i could do that .  they ve been to france  _comma_   italy  _comma_   croatia and chile so far   i m sitting in nc!
i totally get why you feel that way .   your time will come soon . 
i would just like to be able to drive to raleigh without hurting! i fell and broke my hip a while back and can t walk properly . 
i hope you can recover soon!
one more operation and i should be good .  in the meantime _comma_  i have to live vicariously through joe and helen :)
my wife has been out of the country for   months _comma_  she gets back in a week .   i can t wait!
that s good! i bet you missed her a lot . 
i really did .   it ll be great to have her back :)
i m sure she ll have a lot to tell you about her trip!
when i interviewed for the job i have now _comma_  they didn t give me a solid answer for like a month after the interview . 
that s a long time to kind of hang in limbo .  i am sorry you had to endure that for a month . 
it worked out ok _comma_  but i had to keep bugging them to make sure they hadn t given up on me . 
well _comma_  at least that story had a happy ending .  it could have went much worse . 
my wife has been out of the country for the last   months for school . 
aw _comma_  i bet you miss her a lot . 
i do .   she s getting back soon _comma_  but it s been tough being along with the dogs every night . 
well _comma_  at least the dogs still have you for company .  i m sure you ll be happy when she gets back though . 
when i interviewed for my current job _comma_  i felt like it went well but all i could do was wait . 
what kind of job is it?
a lab technician at a university . 
interesting! what kind of things do you do?
my parents brought my brother a brand new iphone .  he always gets the newest stuff and i get stuck with nothing . 
aw man that sucks how come he gets to get one but not you
i have no idea .  he s the  golden child .   it s super unfair . 
well after a certain age parent s start to treat children differently lol
my wife has been out of the country for two months _comma_  which is really hard when one of us is having a bad day and we can t help the other . 
when does she return?
she gets back in a week _comma_  so it s almost over . 
well thats good
my husband opened the door and a huge wasp flew in! i hate insects .  they are so nasty
did you go running like crazy!? 
heck yes i did! i locked myself in the room and told him he needs to kill that thing before he goes to work
i would have done the same glad no one got stung! 
i hate all the mosquitos that grow during the rain season
they are bad now too _comma_  they are so annoying
yes i hate going out when it is rainny season there is so many of them
it can be irritating to deal with this time of year
both me and my girlfriend are super scared of spiders _comma_  but she made me kill a huge one yesterday .  
come on _comma_  the worst that can happen is that it kills you . 
exactly!!!! isn t that enough to fear them?!
it s certainly a good enough reason to kill them . 
i m going skydiving for the first time with some friends!
wow _comma_  are you nervous at all
a little bit _comma_  but i love doing extreme stuff like this . 
that s exciting .  i d never have the guts to do it so kudos to you . 
the othern ight i was having tea outside and forgot my glass outside all night! 
that kind of stinks .  sorry to hear that! well _comma_  at least there are worst things to forget outside .  maybe this is an easy learning lesson!
it was gross though when i went to go and get it! it was all full of bugs! 
i didn t even think of that! that s one thing about tea with me  _comma_   that i ve never gotten into it because you get it and it s so hot  _comma_   so you have to wait forever to drink it .  you set it down and then ultimately forget it!
on my last visit to my orthopedic surgeon he suggested surgery to fix my hip . 
yikes that sounds scary but overall good for the end results .  how do you feel about it? 
nervous .  surgery is a big step and i m afraid something will go wrong . 
i understand i would be too but now a days technology is really good just make sure its a reliable hospital! 
you re absolutely correct and the hospital s one of the best in the country .  still _comma_  i fret about it .  i should just get on with it!
i m about to go overseas and i was so overwhelmed with packing and getting ready and my friend came over and helped me to pack 
that s a good friend you got there . 
she is wonderful! she helped me out so many times i don t know what i would do withiut her
never take someone like that for granted .  they are so rare . 
cell phones are great _comma_  but sometimes they can cause situations that are uncomfortable . 
what types of situations are you referring to?
usually they just interupt with a ring .  but youtube is on my lock screen and it played out loud while i was inline _comma_  and it was not an appropriate topic!
lol _comma_  did everyone around you make funny faces?
of course they did  _comma_   some guy in this video was dropping the f bomb out of no where .  i was humiliated  _comma_  lol . 
my dog died today :(
i am so sorry to hear that .  was she able to go surrounded by you guys?
yes _comma_  she had cancer so we knew she was going to pass soon .  my daughter won t stop crying . 
it s hard to lose a family member like that .  you guys should take some time to grieve . 
my daughter went on vacation with her friends and the house feels so lonely
where did they go?
they went to the beach for   week
that sounds like so much fun!
i m moving to a new apartment in a few weeks and can t wait! no more obnoxious upstairs neighbors!
that s great!  i ve got to deal with loud neighbors too .   anything specific they do?
stomp around at all times of the day and night _comma_  screeching into their cellphones and playing loud video games .  what do yours do?
loud running toddler who pitches fits at random times _comma_  day or night .   sounds like a similar level of noise :p
eww .  yes _comma_  it is loud .  who would live in an upstairs apartment with a small child? that s nuts!
my wife has been out of the country for two months _comma_  and is coming back in a week!
oh wow _comma_  i bet you can t wait! i remember when i had to spend a summer overseas and it was awful to be away from my husband . 
it sure is .   it s just been me and the dogs all summer _comma_  i ve gotten super bored :p
well _comma_  she ll be back soon and you ll have loads of catching up to do .  i bet the dogs missed her too!
i hope you do too! applying is a huge step in the right direction!
could you elaborate as to why?
i had such a huge spider ran past me in the bathroom .  i am so grossed out by all the bugs here!
oh no could you call an exterminator?
spiders could bite me _comma_  which could really hurt!
i feel that with my training lately im going to win my next week soccer game
i m sure you ll do great!  how long have you been training?
for this specific game for about   months
wow _comma_  that s a lot of dedication!  i believe in you!
after my wife and i moved i went through a while of unemployment .   it was really tough not being able to support us . 
i can imagine _comma_  i have been there and it is the worst just belive in yourself
it s gotten better now _comma_  but it could still get even better .   just got to keep on moving . 
yeah it always gets bbbetter that is the good thing
i am really happy for next year i have a trip planned to go to india

i had the most wonderful week recently .  my neighbors weren t here and i could do whatever i wanted without them stomping on my head!
that sounds like a relief . 
it was .  i can t even brush my teeth at  am without one or the other of them thumping around upstairs . 
it seems like it s a lot of ruckus _comma_  i ve visited friends who have your situation and i can only imagine .  
that blessed week was so peaceful and calming .  everything felt right in my world .  then they came back!
glad you enjoyed that short period of peace .  maybe soon you will get new neighbors or you can get a better place . 
getting a new apartment soon .  at least the new neighbors will hopefully be at work during the day . 
oh _comma_  good .  i m sure it will be an improvement from your current situation . 
i went to work with my pants inside out _comma_  and i didn t notice until my secretary pointed it out . 
omg i would have been so embarrassed! :o 
it was very embarrassing! at least i didn t go the whole day like that . 
thats true imagine if you had! it takes a lot of talent tho to put your pants on inside out and still manage to button them .  ha ha 
the airport was completely empty the other day . 
that is awesome  _comma_   i hope that happens to me on my next trip  _comma_   where where you going
home  _comma_   but i thought la would be crowded even at  am  _comma_   it made the hair on my arms stand up it was so creepy . 
well you are really lucky to have an empty airport
made getting my connection super easy _comma_  and trust me i was in a hurry to get there .  odd how being alone can make you paranoid . 
i cant wait to see my dog back home it has been   years since i see him
i would go mad _comma_  were you away at college or in the service?
college _comma_  but i will be seeing him very soon i think
that is great _comma_  i am sure he misses you and will be so happy to see you .  he will smell you coming and know your there even before you get in the door . 
so my youngest went to his first day of kindergarten today .   so proud of him .   silly i know . 
that s not silly at all! i m sure he ll love it . 
i hope so should be home really soon .   can t wait to hear all about it .   it goes by to fast!
yeah _comma_  he ll be all grown up before you know it!
i know my oldest just graduated _comma_   it was like it was over in an instant!
a few months ago we were planning our wedding and i couldn t wait until the actual day finally arrived . 
did it turn out how you expected it
it was even better then expected .  it was very small _comma_  but so happy how it turned out . 
i m glad to hear .  weddings can be stressful
i hate when my neighboors dog poops on my yard and she does nothing _comma_  i dont care if he poops if she picks it up
maybe put the poop back on your neighbors yard?
hahaha i mean he does not do it often but it is not a bad idea
its the only way to get them to learn
after studying and preaching for a few years _comma_  my husband was ordained to be a minister . 
that s wonderful _comma_  it s always good when hard work pays off like that!
yes it is and he is so devoted to god and living for him .  i was so happy for him . 
i bet so that sounds nice
thank you . 
this morning _comma_  my dog knocked down a while box of cereal and it spilled everywhere . 
oh wow _comma_  that sounds like it was a big mess . 
yes    _comma_     and to make it worse    _comma_     when i tried to clean it    _comma_     she tried to eat    _comma_     so she almost knocked me over too .  i was not happy . 
i hope she didn t eat too much of it _comma_  it might make her sick . 
no _comma_  she only ate a little bit .  i cleaned it up pretty quickly . 
there was a new resturaunt that opened up around the corner and everyone was raving about it 
oh yeah? did you go give it a try?
i did! it was terrible! i was so upset! it was expensive  _comma_   small  _comma_   and bland! 
that s a shame .  i hate it when a place doesn t live up to the hype . 
in my last job most of my co workers had different beliefs to me .  it was a little awkward at times . 
that can be a bit uncomfortable for sure .  did you try and avoid conversations
if things got a bit much i d excuse myself and go elsewhere .  i didn t want to get into an argument _comma_  but wasn t going to compromise my own beliefs by lying . 
if it gets to be too much be sure to walk away . 
i became quite good at that   the great vanishing employee  _comma_   lol .  i m all for earnest discussion  _comma_   but not at work!
my husband had to repair something and we bought a ton of lumber .  he was able to carry so much at once! 
he must be really strong!
he is! i was so shocked but super attracted to him too! 
sure _comma_   i strong men is very attractive! you must be proud of him!
i was really sad when my dog died last year
that is hard thing to go through .  i hope you are feeling better about it now . 
yeah i have been over it for sometime now but it is till hard to talk about
i bet .  losing a pet is much like losing a loved one .  it gets better but still hurts sometime . 
a good friend was supposed to visit me this summer _comma_  but he got a job and had to cancel . 
aw  _comma_   that sucks .  but at least he got a job  _comma_   right?
yeah  _comma_   and it s one he really wanted and enjoys .  i m really happy for him  _comma_   but would have really liked to see him . 
well _comma_  hopefully he can schedule another time to come visit you . 
i hope so .  we always have such a good time and like a lot of the same things .  oh well _comma_  some other time . 
my husband s grandmother and i were very close .  we hung out and talked everyday .  one friday    _comma_     we went to breakfast and she told me that her and her husband were going on vacation the next day .  she was so excited .  the next morning i called her after they had left and told her to be safe    _comma_     have fun    _comma_     and that i loved her .  she told me she loved me too .  the morning after that phone call    _comma_     we found out that she had a heart attack and died .   
oh my .  that is very unfortunate . 
yes  _comma_   it hit our whole family very hard .  that was in       _comma_   and sometimes i still pick up the phone to call her and tell her something . 
i know that feeling .  im sure she is looking down on you all . 
thank you . 
my cat went missing   days ago .  i found her .  
that must have been a little bit of a roller coaster .  that s kind of why i m not wild about cats  _comma_   is because they re so independent  _comma_   and the outside cats can just go hang out somewhere for days and not have a care in the world about you .  but i guess that suits some people . 
i found her on the side of the street with her guts hanging in the gutter .  i was so upset and sad
oh man .  so that was really a roller coaster then .  i m so sorry .  i hope you re not overwhelming yourself with guilt about it .  it sounds like something you could not have any control over . 
i love to play golf _comma_  but injured my hip a while back .  i really want to play again . 
my nephew is getting into golf! it seems like a cool enough sport  _comma_   albeit a little expensive .  i hope you re able to get back to playing again .  i ve taken up running and swimming  _comma_   and it s interesting how much those physical activities relieve stress in our day . 
it sure is! good on your nephew   it s a great sport .  and good for you _comma_  too .  it s all too easy just to sit back .  i have to force myself to do physical therapy so i can walk again!
well   _comma_    often people just give up and relegate themselves to just sitting in a chair and watching tv .  even if you have to force yourself   _comma_    at least you are forcing yourself .  at some point hopefully you will see progress and feel it getting easier .  once that happens   _comma_    motivation starts to become real easy to get . 
just the thought of getting back on the golf course is enough to get me off the couch _comma_  lol . 
skydiving is an exillirating and scary experience!
i ve never been skydiving myself .  i hear that it s a great experience _comma_  but i m not sure if i have the bravery for it . 
i did not for many years _comma_  but my brother convinced me to tandem with him to celebrate our mothers remission . 
oh wow .  is it something that you would do again?
i think when my children are grown that i might _comma_  i would need to feel secure with the abilities of those in charge .  you are putting your life in their hands . 
i bought a new tv .  the colors are so vibrant and it is so sharp!
sounds like fund _comma_  you must be excited!
i am _comma_  i have been watching all my favorite movies .  
i think i will need to do that _comma_  my tv is an oldy .   i am sure you will have a great time . 
i am _comma_  i think my wife is getting tired of all the time i am spending watching movies .  
i woke up needing to use the bathroom at midnight .  as soon as i sit down a giant bug flew into my face! 
that sounds horrible .  i would not have been able to sleep after that . 
i screamed so loud that i woke up my husband and he though we were being burgled! 
how terrifying .  i hope you were able to find and kill it . 
i have this very serious interview tomorrow and i m so nervous .  i know what to say but i m scared i will forget everything
well _comma_  it s okay to be a bit nervous .  interviewers will understand that .  you only have to halfway reign in it in and you ll hit that happy medium that s good for a workplace interview .  where are you applying to?
a government position .  can t really say much .  :) but i really hope i will get this job _comma_  they pay really good money
i bet you have a good shot at it! good luck
i had a dream the other night about my friends from high school .  it brought back all kinds of memories from my teen years and thinking back made me smile . 
did you tell anyone about the dream?
i told my husband .  the dream made me miss my best friend from high school . 
you should call your best friend on the telephone!
i actually sent her a message through facebook . 
that is sure to make you feel the nostalgic?
i guess that s a good word for it .  
i came home from work today and my wife had a new puppy waiting for me . 
oh that sounds like fun
yeah _comma_  he is such a cutie .  i have been playing with my new pup the rest of the day .  
sounds like a wonderful day!
it is  _comma_   a day i will always remember .  i named him spot  _comma_   because he has a funny looking spot on his back .  
i saved up the money to buy a certain dress that i had been wanting for a while .  when i finally got the money saved   _comma_    it was sold out everywhere   _comma_    except ebay .  the problem was   _comma_    the price was doubled . 
oh my!! what are you going to do? i would buy it anyway .  
i may buy it still _comma_  but i have to save up more money now . 
well thats unfortunate .  hopefully you will be able to buy it soon .  
i hope so .  i as so exited to be able to get it . 
i bought a load of german chocolate bars in aldi .  i then ate too many of them .  i shouldn t have done that   no self control!
it happens to the best of us .  it would be great if they did not make us gain weight . 
it was sheer greed  _comma_   i m afraid .  i know everyone has their moments  _comma_   but i really shouldn t have done that . 
well you have to live a little every now and then .  i m sure it was worth it _comma_  haha . 
it certainly was   german chocolate is delicious!
my son is sick  _comma_   he got this hand foot and mouth desease  _comma_   nothing serious but he has a fever
oh no _comma_  poor baby
i know  _comma_   i got some motrin  _comma_   funny movies and lots of cuddles . i hope he will feel better tomorrow
yes cuddles will help
i used to be a member of a cool dance crew .  we had so much fun together .  we used to battle other teams and win local competitions
that sounds really fun .  can you still remember some of the routines?
honestly  _comma_   no  _comma_   it s been   years haha loooong time ago! i wish i could hang out with all those people again
yea that is a long time .  you should reach out to some and see if they are on social media . 
i m getting really psyched about the upcoming ryder cup golf tournament .  i ve been watching it since i was a kid . 
i m fascinated by how people can watch golf  _comma_   i always found it really boring  _comma_   but if you enjoy it then great!
i ve been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching .  i d imagine that  _comma_   if you don t play  _comma_   it would be pretty boring!
oh that totally changes things i guess _comma_  makes sense . 
i think it s the format of this tournament that gets me addicted .  it s not like regular tournaments _comma_  in that teams are playing against each other . 
last christmas eve   _comma_    after a family event   _comma_    i found my ten year old daughter crying in her room .  at the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him   _comma_    and it had hurt her feelings . 
aw that s terrible _comma_  at least you were able to comfort her?
yes   _comma_    i was able to make her feel better   _comma_    and her daddy made her laugh .  but my mama bear side came out   _comma_    and i was ready to confront some people . 
i m sure you were! those people deserved some confrontation for sure . 
yes _comma_  they did . 
i was cleaning up my garden bed when i found a bunch of bones in it! 
oh my god! what did you do? did you tell anyone?
i called the cops! turns out that it s bird bones! my cat has been killing bird after bird and leaving it in my garden! 
lololol the cops probably had a good laugh about that . 
i get really mad when i hear about people abusing animals .  what revolting individuals!
me too!!! ii never could understand what drives people to be so mean to such innocent creatures .  
they re filthy  _comma_   ignorant bullies .  i would sentence them to life in prison  _comma_   without parole!!!
really!! i would go even further and give them the electric chair .  i have no tolerance for those types of people .  
more laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted .  so many states have nothing on the statute books . 
last night i heard a weird noise outside .  it really scared my wife and i .  
oh _comma_  i hate it when that happens .  did you find out what it was?
it ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash .  but at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in .  
i m glad it wasn t something dangerous .  that would be a terrifying experience . 
it would be _comma_  i worry for the safety of my family .  
my friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me .  i really do believe he ll repay me . 
you do? thats good _comma_  friends can be terrible people to lend too . 
they can  _comma_   but he was in a real bind and i was able to do so .  i know he s grateful for the loan  _comma_   so i reckon i ll be ok there . 
i bet he pays you in full . 
even part would be ok .  he needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn t find himself in that situation again . 
my husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! i was so scared at first 
i bet that was scary .  did he surprise you with something?
he did! he had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting .  dinner was ready and waiting and warm too! 
ahhh .  how nice .  you are lucky to have such a thoughtful husband .  
ever seen a drone fly at night? it s far creepier than you might imagine at first  _comma_   especially if it s in the early morning  _comma_   like  am or something . 
does it look like a space ship?
well at night it s kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything .  all you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it _comma_  and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props .  but who knows what could be attached to the drone? cameras? some kind of gas?
i have never seen a drone flying around here .  even in the day time
i love my friend _comma_  she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it s annoying sometimes
what does she do?
like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat
wow _comma_  i would just tell her its private .  sounds annoying
it is so difficult to have a pet pass away _comma_  i really miss him . 
aw i understand that _comma_  i have gone through that myself and it s very hard .  when did this happen? 
over the summer _comma_  he started acting strange so we took him in for testing . 
oh no i m very sorry .  what kind of pet? 
a border collie _comma_  he was a great doggie . 
my daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing .  i was so worried i didn t know what to do with myself . 
oh no _comma_  have you been able to calm yourself down?
she called several hours later to let me know everything was ok .  i worry even more because they live so far away . 
i can understand that _comma_  i think i would be a mess too . 
i am actually furious .  i m writing this from a hotel .  a truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday .  place smells awful . 
that does not sound plpeasant at all _comma_  maybe they should relocate those who are staying there . 
i relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired .  luckily my insurance is paying for my stay _comma_  but i ll be suing the hell out of the trucking company . 
hopefully no one was injured at all from the accident?
i am so glad that i decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather . 
i bet you are _comma_  that s some pretty good foresight right there! did you have to use it this past winter?
i did _comma_  two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it .  i would have been very unhappy had i not packed it . 
how satisfying must it be to have something like that ready to go in case of emergency  _comma_   and then to actually get to use it? i m pretty jealous  _comma_   and proud in a vicarious kind of way . 
i was   _comma_    and happy to have water   _comma_    granola bars   _comma_    and an extra cell phone charger!
i have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year . 
well good luck with that!
thank you  _comma_   i have been compiling  data for   years  _comma_   my brain is totally absorbed by it . 
what are you studying?
criminal and social justice . 
i just froze when it was my turn to get on the tycoon rollar coaster at disney world . 
do roller coasters scare you
i think it was just the thought of being so high up . 
i used to be afriad of heights too
i had to stay home and work _comma_  while all my friends go to denver and snowboard . 
that s a bummer .  maybe next time you can join them . 
hopefully _comma_  but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone . 
sound like a netflix weekend then .  hope you got a lot of work done . 
in some ways  _comma_   losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative .  they re so innocent  _comma_   they re so helpless .  they don t deserve to have to die or suffer ever . 
goodness _comma_  you re right about that .  plus a pet is the only thing to show unconditional and neverending love for you . 
exactly  _comma_   and they never demand anything from you .  when my golden retriever louie died a few weeks ago  _comma_   i honestly thought i would die too . 
i m so very sorry for your loss _comma_  i can only imagine that pain .  i had to put my girl down   years ago and i promise that it does get easier . 
thank you _comma_  that s good to hear .  i find it pretty difficult to continue on most days . but i suppose it s starting to get easier . 
a week before my cruise this summer _comma_  i was counting down the days with bated breath .  i thought i would actually die before i got to go on it . 
it s the worst waiting for vacations! you want the time before to go fast but then it to go slow during .  never works out that way _comma_  unfortunately . 
yes! completely the opposite of what you want .  the universe can be funny like that .  but i had an absolute blast!
that s great! i m glad you had a good time .  i ve never been on a cruise before but it sounds like i need to try one out!
when my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn t ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped .  
and how is she doing now
she is a normal a b student and just started  th grade
that is awesome .   sometimes a second opinion is all you need
i finally had a day of _comma_  but the weather was terrible and rainy and cold . 
aww that s too bad .   i hope you got some solid netflix in at least!
i was hoping to get a chance to play outside and get some sun . 
bummer .   well i hope you get a chance to do that soon!
i just got back from a latenight showing of the horror movie insidious
oh that sounds fun!
not really i  almost had an accident at some of the startling points . 
that isn t good at all _comma_  glad you didn t have an accident .  
i have been looking around at different car insurance quotes
did you find any good companies . 
a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is
did you have alot of accidents that can jack your rates up . 
i just ate a whole cake by myself _comma_  i feel sick!
it s okay! try to rest on the couch and that might help!
thank you _comma_  being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house .  
i know that feeling all too well .  but don t get down on it _comma_  just try better tomorrow . 
the other night i had a panic attack out the blue 
that must have been scary .   is that the first time it has happened to you?
sadly no _comma_  i get them maybe once a year .  the worst part was that i had nothing to be stressed about .  
are you able to do anything to prevent them?
i left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out .  i can t believe i would be so careless . 
i m sure that he will turn up soon .  i really hope that you find him . 
we have been driving around all evening looking for him .  he really is my best friend . 
maybe check your local animal shelters? sometimes they are taken there by people who find them .  
we will have to go there next _comma_  hopefully he is chilling there .  
i felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me .  we d been seeing each other for a few months _comma_  and everything was fine .  then . nothing . 
aww _comma_  i m sorry to hear that .   was it a bad break up or did you part on good terms?
that s just it .  we didn t really  break up  in the traditional sense .  she just sort of stopped talking to me and i eventually texted her and said okay _comma_  thanks for the memories .  but it was rough . 
that s really odd .   i wonder why they didn t have the courtesy to let you know that they d lost interest or whatever the case may be .   to just cut off contact seems a little rude . 
today i was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink .  i couldn t believe people would be so nice _comma_  i was so thankful because money has been tight . 
how thoughtful .   now you have to pay it forward _comma_  as the saying goes . 
i will _comma_  you never know when someone else is in need! 
kindness is infectious . 
it is _comma_  i have been so blessed in my life! 
my husband started college this week!
how exciting _comma_  is he a non traditional student?
yes _comma_  he is still active duty army but getting out in november .  i am so proud of him furthering his education!
that is really good  _comma_   speaking from experience  _comma_   all military men and women should get a degree . 
i am a really picky eater _comma_  and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me . 
why? what happened? i hope you didn t get food posioning . 
no poisoning  _comma_   but my burger had a long hair in it  _comma_   so i couldn t eat it . 
oh gosh  _comma_   that is gross! maybe tell the manager so he can make it right  _comma_   and make sure his staff is doing things to health codes!
so gross _comma_  that is certain . 
i got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk i tripped on thin air
oh no! i hope you did not burn yourself . 
i thankfully didn t burn myself bad but i spilled it all over myself! i was so shy afterwards 
hopefully you were wearing dark clothing _comma_  coffee on light colors stinks!
watching scary movies lately has me paranoid _comma_  i was really frightened the other night . 
oh no! what happened?
i went for a drink downstairs  _comma_   and the back door was wide open .  i didn t sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night  _comma_  lol . 
oh man! i would have been so scared! 
i really was  _comma_   and i m supposed to be the grown up  _comma_   but i got my daughter to lie next to me . 
my neighbors dog are barking so loud and my daughter is asleep!
ugh that s so annoying .  what are they even barking at?
people walking on the bike trail behind our house .  it s a daily thing _comma_  it gets so annoying! 
yeah _comma_  that would drive me crazy .  sounds like the neighbor needs to control their dogs . 
i just got done eating an entire pizza by myself . 
i do that all the time _comma_  no big deal . 
i feel so full and fat and happy .  i can t wait to do it again . 
what kind of pizza did you eat?
when i got my first paycheck with a bonus _comma_  i knew i didn t need to worry anymore about my expenses .  it was quite the feeling!
that is such a relief _comma_  it is so nice to have money saved up in the bank .  
yes exactly! i was able to finally start saving for retirement .  i d been procrastinating somewhat  _comma_   so it really was a relief  _comma_   like you said . 
oh yeah  _comma_   retirement will come before you know it  _comma_   it is good to be prepared! 
tomorrow i start my new job teaching kids .  i really hope it goes well!
oh wow  _comma_   now that really is exciting  _comma_   congratulations! did you get the grade level and subject you wanted?
i am teaching at a small private school  _comma_   so i will be teaching all the subjects for  rd grade .  i am pretty excited  _comma_   just nervous .  
teaching little humans will be such a joy .  i really hope you enjoy it!
it really is _comma_  you are molding their future! 
i just lost my dog .  my ex got him in the divorce
that sucks _comma_  will she not let you see the dog at all?
no we are not on speaking terms  _comma_   it s pretty unfair  _comma_   thankfully we didn t have a kid together . 
yes _comma_  that is probably a positive . 
getting a new debit card takes so long and really is a hassle . 
yeah it really does .  it s even worse to try and close those accounts!
they don t want to .  i lost mine or it was stolen .  but all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it . 
man that sounds really stressful . 
it is _comma_  to say the least .  but at leaast it will be over at some point . 
my sister got a promotion at work last week!
oh that is awesome .  what does she do?
she is an accountant for a college in alaska .  she s been working their for years so i m glad they saw her dedication :)
that is great .  my sister is an account too .  she s also the office manager . 
my friend wrote a creative writing piece that i helped edit   _comma_    and it won her a scholarship .  i was so proud   _comma_    like a dad   _comma_    even though we re roughly the same age . 
congrats to your friend! that is an amazing accomplishment . 
yeah it was! i joke with her that i should get a portion of the money since i told her she had a really good piece and that she should submit it .  she wasn t originally going to . 
i would be proud of her too! hopefully her success continues .  you sound like a good friend!
my eldest son is off and is starting his first year in college .   im so nervous for him!
don t be .  i m sure you raised him right .  he will be starting his new adventure
i think it s more stressful for me than it is for him!  i just want the best for him _comma_  just not used to not being there with him . 
i m sure he s cool as a cucumber while you are a nervous wreck .  it will be fine . 
thanks!  i m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up .   gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?
it will be find .  have a little fiath in him and you will see
cant wait to see what he can do _comma_   its exciting too!  
it s very exciting .  i wish you both all the best . 
i have trouble remembering a time i was more incredibly overwhelmed with excitement than when i got the nintendo    for christmas all those years ago . 
i remember that console _comma_  that s old school . 
it sure is now _comma_  but back then it was the cream of the crop .  you can bet that i stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening . 
those were the good old days!
i need a b average to stay in my major and i m struggling in a course . 
are you able to get some tutoring or find a study buddy?
i found a study group _comma_  i didn t flunk the class .  but i made an    on my physics test and need an    . 
thats good .  well you are on your way up!
hopefully _comma_  i don t even understand how others get all a s . 
i came home from work today and my husband had dinner already made! 
thats awesome _comma_  can we trade?
haha my husband plays video games as well _comma_  but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only . 
that is a really good idea .  he must be thoughtful to have cooked dinner for you and had it ready _comma_  unlike mine
let me tell you something .  always check before you go grocery shopping to see if you need to pick up coffee filters .  few things worse than having to go without your morning coffee because you forgot!
that is very true
not only did i have a rough morning because of it _comma_  but i had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work .  what a disaster . 
hopefully its better tomorrow!
hmm _comma_  that s interesting tell me more about what that number means to you . 
four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon _comma_  they carry something in their nails claws . 
really  _comma_   my friend had a tarantula as a pet when she was five  _comma_   scared the poop out of me
my son wanted one of those once  _comma_   but when we got to the pet store he refused to hold one  _comma_  lol . 
i got canned from my job and i m feeling pretty good these days because i have more work than i can handle without needing to go to an office everyday
are you really able to work from home? finding a gig is so difficult _comma_  i m glad that it is working for you . 
yeah it s still a work in progress but i m young and basically living on peanuts _comma_  good thing i m not allergic
i was laying in bed last night when i realized just how happy i am
that is fantastic .  any good new lately?
nope! i just realized how happy and content i am with my life! 
that is an amazing feeling .  
i had such a bad cold last week _comma_  i was coughing up a lot of nasty stuff into cups just so that it wouldn t hurt when i swallowed . 
did you go to the doctor
no  _comma_   thankfully my symptoms weren t anything that couldn t be managed with a stiff mimosa or seven .  but still  _comma_   i had to throw those cups out .  yuck . 
yuk for sure
no matter how many times i told her that i didn t do it _comma_  my roommate insisted that i ate her ice cream last night! unbelievable!
well _comma_  did you eat her ice cream?
i certainly would have liked to  _comma_   but i m lactose intolerant! if i had eaten it  _comma_   i would have been so miserable that there s no way she would ve mistaken it . 
i wonder who actually ate it then . 
she probably did   _comma_    during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at  am   _comma_    drunk   _comma_    with some random guy she brought home from the club . 
so are you saying it could be the guy?
either he ate it  _comma_   or she did and she just doesn t remember doing it .  all i know is that i didn t do it  _comma_   and i m about to hulk out!
i am so not ready for this baby .  the wife is due next week _comma_  and i m really uncertain that i m gonna be a good dad or that we ll have enough to provide for her . 
you will be fine .  its going to be hard but dont beat yourself up over it . 
i hope you re right .  i ve read lots of parenting books _comma_  and i ve been seeing my therapist regularly .  there s just so much that i m still worried about . 
then it sounds like you are already ahead of most new fathers .  
i was walking and say a cat in front of me wagging its tail on the sidewalk and thought it was awesome
that would be pretty cool to see  _comma_   but you should know that typically most cats swish their tail when they re annoyed or angry! it didn t attack you  _comma_   did it?
i attacked it with some pets _comma_  it was an outside cat which don t get angry too much i m guessing
ahh  _comma_   okay .  yeah i don t know .  it might have also been scared or feeling like it had to protect it s turf .  but still  _comma_   that s neat to see and not an everyday thing!
i m taking my midterm exam this week  _comma_   and i really want to do well on it .  i ve studied a lot  _comma_   and taken the practice test   times .  i m still pretty anxious though!
nice  _comma_   i guess the only times i was nervous to take a test was when i wasn t prepared  _comma_   but there s only so much preparation you can do until you just have to trust your brain or whatever
that s true .  i probably have it down pat at this point .  it s just it s my first graduate course _comma_  and i want to ace my entire graduate degree with a   .   gpa .  this is my first major major grade . 
wow! you must have like every technique in your toolbox to go for that goal
i was unpacking the other day and realized that my ex girlfriend didn t get all of her stuff out of my place after we split up and before i moved .  really made me miss her _comma_  seeing all that stuff . 
i bet it does bud _comma_  i know the feeling .  so how do you deal with it
well   _comma_    i spent some time remembering the good times .  then i reminded myself that we broke up for a reason   _comma_    and we d moved on .  had to process all the way through it   _comma_    you know?
yes i know _comma_  good memories do help .  every relation is a new chapter in the book called our life . 
polie officers should still be required to drive safely even when responding to a call . 
sometimes they cant avoid it 
i threw the car in reverse and hauled my butt backwards!
ok
i understand   _comma_    but coming at me head on   _comma_    on a two lane highway   _comma_    while i m on a bridge with nowhere to go is not cool . 
i cant imagine how scared you must have been . 
uh oh _comma_  did he destroy something? sounds as though he misbehaved a bit . 
not sure .  you must be very confused .  did you crash?
i saw a scorpion in my house yesterday and still haven t found it!
oh god .  was it big?
yes _comma_  im scared to sleep! it ran under couch last time i saw it . 
well _comma_  maybe look at its lifespan? maybe it ll die if you end up not finding it . 
i am constantly amazed by my sister s art skills .  i m not sure where she got them . my brother and i can t draw to save our lives . 
what does she draw
mostly anime characters and various portraits .  she s still quite young  _comma_   so she has a way to go  _comma_   but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when i was her age? forget about it . 
thats awesome
i used to worry that i would never have a long term friend who would be there to listen to me if i had problems _comma_  but my best friend kayla has proved otherwise .  
kayla sounds wonderful! how long have you guys been friends?
i ll have known her for   years next year .  she really is wonderful .  i ve gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life _comma_  and she s always been supportive . 
finding someone like that is rare .  take good care of that one!
i have some bad news  _comma_   unfortunately .  well  _comma_   bad for me .  i was diagnosed with lung cancer . 
i am sorry to hear that .  how far along is it?
it s stage two .  i think i ll be able to beat it because i m otherwise in great health _comma_  and it hasn t metastasized or anything .  i just wasn t expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me . 
keep a positive attitude .  i will be thinking of you!
thank you so much for being supportive .  :)
i heard gunshots outside my house the other day in the middle of the night .  i think it was   or   in the morning . 
did you find out what happened?
not a chance! i was too scared to go out _comma_  and i didn t want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up .  i honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me . 
man .  that must ve been really nerve wrecking .  did you get any sleep?
only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up .  after that _comma_  no way jose . 
i really didn t know what to expect while my dad was having neck surgery last weekend . 
did it turn out ok ?
seems to have  _comma_   yeah .  he has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year  _comma_   but that s happened during his previous neck surgeries as well . 
hopes he continues to get better
yes   _comma_    hopefully he does   _comma_    because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely   _comma_    not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore . 
i got some pretty horrible news recently .  i ve been diagnosed hiv positive .  i m just . lost . 
i m so sorry!  don t lose hope though .  i know some science based nutrition that helps you overcome and kill it going high nutrition plant based vegan .   look up dr .  joel furhman .   it ll save you from all the meds that hurt your body . 
i might look into that   _comma_    thank you for being supportive .  i know it s nowhere near a death sentence anymore   _comma_    it s just there are so many questions .  can i have kids   _comma_    is a big one . 
i know it must be overwhelming you but coming from someone that is fighting chronic epstein barr virus and lupus  _comma_   it will change your life .   check out hiv and going vegan on youtube and thebody  _comma_  com and so many other resources .   you might be able to reverse it and it wouldn t even be a concern for having kids .   you take care and have hope!
playing old video games reminds of the summers where my friends and i would hang out endlessly
sounds like you re feeling nostalgic .   what games were you plaing?
super smash bros is a classic  _comma_   never gets old  _comma_   but yeah you re right
i ve never played it but its supposed to havea bunch of old game characters in it
i had a job interview recently
oh _comma_  how did it go?
not well .  i didn t really feel prepared for it . 
i m sorry _comma_  i am sure you will be ready next time . 
speaking of co workers  _comma_   one of my colleagues just found the cure for type   diabetes  _comma_   and i honestly couldn t be more annoyed about it . 
wait _comma_  why would you be annoyed by that? that s amazing!
yeah   _comma_    yeah   _comma_    yeah .  amazing and all   _comma_    but it was supposed to be my discovery .  i wanted that nobel prize and the trip to stockholm .  now i don t think my dad will ever think i ve accomplished anything . 
i think you need to look at the bigger picture _comma_  though .  someone cured a disease that has caused so much suffering for so many people .  though i suppose to can be both excited for the discovery and jealous at the same time .  the two aren t mutually exclusive . 
i went to a movie alone recently because none of my friends wanted to go with me
what movie did you see
jurassic world .  it was okay . 
yeah i have heard bad things to be honest
i just bought iced coffee yesterday and my brother drank the rest of it without asking me . 
wow .  does he usually do stuff like that?
yeah _comma_  he will eat or drink whatever he finds in the fridge .  
damn well _comma_  he s gonna have to learn some boundaries with that . 
i thought it was unfair how youtube banned alex jones
it is indeed unfair _comma_  they shouldn t have done that
i think people are just getting riled up for the midterms
you are right .  but hey people just do what they want to!!
i was playing hide n seek when i was a kid and i had to use the restroom _comma_  but then i realized after a couple minutes that there was someone behind the shower curtain
i bet that was awkward
yeah _comma_  nobody said anything
i guess that happens sometimes _comma_  did you finish the game
my girlfriend has been cheating on me with another woman!
that is terrible and a little odd!
yeah  _comma_   tell me about it! i trusted her to only cheat on me with other men  _comma_   but i just don t know how i can deal with this betrayal!!!
wait _comma_  you were ok with her cheating?
not like this! she assured me that she wasn t that type of girl _comma_  and i was stupid enough to believe her . 
i knew that i needed to support my uncle bill when he told me he wanted to flee to canada to escape military duty .  family always comes first . 
yes indeed! what did you do?
i helped him pack the essentials in his wood paneled station wagon and filled his gas tank for him .  it was the least i could do . 
you did great! family comes first .  and you gave him your support!
speaking of kids in school _comma_  i just found out my son got a b in his world history class at the end of the previous school year .  i can t believe it . 
that s great!!  history is so important i think and so few kids really grasp it well .   congrats to him for a job well done!
no no   _comma_    see   _comma_    it was the first grade below an a that he s ever made .  i honestly thought i had the next einstein on my hands .  now i guess i ll have to settle for . above average   _comma_    i guess .  :(
oh  _comma_   i see what you are saying!  did he get upset about it?  and you never know  _comma_   he could turn it around next year and blow you away!
he seemed fine about it _comma_  which is weird because he s always been so proud to bring home straight as .  i m really hoping he does turn it around next year .  i also hope he s not on drugs or something .  i suppose we ll see . 
so i have some amazing news .  i recently discovered that my dog can speak to me! isn t that incredible?
wow _comma_  is that true? that s pretty amazing! i d say science should know about your dog . 
i d say you re certainly right about that! he s got the best cockney accent though    _comma_     and won t shut up about philosophy .  it s all he wants to talk about! like okay    _comma_     we get it    _comma_     you re suuuuper into immanuel kant    _comma_     cool . 
wow _comma_  that surely is incredible! even the accent too? and intelligent! the full package!
i mean  _comma_   let s be honest .  i m the major league eating world champion .  when i saw that my next closest competition had only ever maxed    hot dogs  _comma_   i knew i had that thing in the bag . 
dang  _comma_   that s a lot of dogs .  cleaned out the pound  _comma_   you did .  but that doesn t hold a candle to the     i ate yesterday . 
ah  _comma_   i see you are a man of culture as well .  i would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle .  be warned  _comma_   however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!
how dare you question my intestinal fortitude?!? i would watch out _comma_  friend .  i may just slip some cyanide in your relish if i ever have the chance to challenge you!
hmph .  well  _comma_   you should check the by laws .  major league eating official rulebook page     _comma_   section   .   . b strictly forbids the usage of cyanide as a food enhancement .  you must eat the food as is .  so i m afraid i ll have to report you to the governing board and get you disqualified . 
i was sick in bed with the flu .  my boyfriend took care of me though
that is so nice of him .  are you feeling better?
yes _comma_  i feel much better now . 
that s good to hear .  i hope i meet someone that will do that for me . 
i was leafing through my old photo albums this morning and ran across a picture of me and my mother .  i really remember her fondly . 
that would bring the tears .  i love looking at pictures especially old ones . 
yes   _comma_    it definitely did .  it reminded me of a simpler time   _comma_    before she abandoned our family to join the local nudist colony .  oh   _comma_    i do miss her though .  she was just the best!
sounds like you are conflicted .  she ran off but she s the best? are you being sarcastic?
i m just saying i respect her life choices _comma_  but she was a great mom while she was around .  i think she s brave . 
my dog pooped on the floor after i let her in the house . 
that s a tragedy! what ever did you do?!?!
i told her she was a bad dog and had to clean it up . 
serves her right! these animals can t go around thinking they can poop on our things!
honestly? i have a pretty special nephew .  he just solved the navier stokes existence and smoothness millenium prize problem . 
holy moses _comma_  he must be as smart as me .  i solved that thing in five minutes last week .  child s play . 
child s play is right   _comma_    the kid is only   years old .  and you couldn t have   _comma_    because the clay institute says the million dollar prize is still at large   _comma_    which i m sure he will be blowing immediately on tropical sprite and cocaine . 
yeah   _comma_    that s what they tell everyone because   _comma_    in reality   _comma_    they blew all the prize money on the very same thing themselves .  i was pretty peeved that i couldn t even get a dime bag and the sleeziest of hookers . 
i ve been trying really hard to get a promotion at my company but they just hired someone to fill that spot from outside of the company . 
ahh  _comma_   that s too bad  _comma_   did you mention it to your boss?
my boss is pretty temperamental and doesn t like people questioning his decisions _comma_  probably a bad idea .  
oh i m sorry to hear that .  maybe next time!
my roommate s cat passed away last week .  there is a heavy air over the household . 
i bet .  that is so sad .  i am so sorry . 
yeah hes really lost without her .  it was unexpected .  
i bet! i hope they can find peace soon . 
i broke up with my boyfriend last week _comma_  and nothing is the same without him . 
time will make it better .  you just have to move on . 
yeah _comma_  i know but we were planning to start our lives together .  we were moving in and now i have to rethink everything . 
better to find out now then move in and invest your time .  trust me it s worse . 
i just made the most delicious pie
really? what kind was it?
it was apple pit _comma_   i let it cool to room temp and ate it with ice cream it was so good . 
oh i love apple pie with ice cream _comma_  it s such a good combination
i just got a new pair of yeezy shoes and a clean hair cut . 
nice _comma_  i wish i could get a pair of those shoes . 
i feel on top of the world .  i don t know whoever said things can t bring you happiness .  they must never owned a pair of yeezy s
how much did you pay for them?
i just went camping and build the warmest fire . 
i love a warm fire outside while camping! sounds like a great time . 
yeah _comma_  i ended up falling asleep to the dying fire .  i felt very safe and secure . 
yes that sounds like a wonderful way to sleep . 
i just had to spend the night all alone in the house .  the power was out and it was storming outside . 
that sounds like it could be quite a scary experience . 
i started a small fire in the trash can to get some light .  it almost started a fire . 
oh yeah that s a bit dangerous .  candles are good to have on hang . 
i m a little worried about travelling to dubai
why are you worried?
these muslim countries can be a bit fanatic 
that is true but dubai is a bit better
i left my cell phone on the table at starbucks . 
oh no! was it still there when you went back?
of course _comma_  i m not worried no one would steal from me . 
you never know these days .  luckily there are cameras everywhere . 
i can t help feel stressed about money
why? are you having financial problems?
yes i just had a major car repair and it took a massive chunk of my savings .      
oh god  _comma_  that sounds horrible but at least nothing bas happened to you!
i felt alone for those   weeks she went to visit family
oh no _comma_  what did you do to stay cheerful ?
lol i played xbox games
sounds good _comma_  when she got back i hope you schooled her on halo ?
i usually don t feel the greatest because of health problems .  
what kind of health problems ?
blood pressure and crohns disease   _comma_    as well as   _comma_    a few minor ones .  not sure why but today i feel really good! slept well   _comma_    woke up happy and energized
i m glad you feel good today!
you wanna know why i m not worried about nuclear armageddon? because i bought a school desk at one of the district auctions _comma_  and all i have to do is duck and cover and nuclear fire won t touch me . 
lol! i remember those drills when i was a kid!
ahh  _comma_   then you know exactly what i mean .  i don t see a single thing wrong with my plan .  i m not sure why everyone is so worried about north korea or iran or russia or something when it s just like . get a school desk .  it s not hard  _comma_   people . 
and your largest hardback book will protect you from a tornado as long as you put it over your head and sit in the hall!!
actually a genius  _comma_   i love it .  parents and teachers tried to tell us that going to school would prepare us for the world .  we just didn t know how right they were  _comma_   did we?
i have a job interview next week .  i m really nervous . 
that s normal .  try to just be your self .  i m sure it will work out fine . 
i m hoping for the best _comma_  but not getting my hopes up too high .  i need a new job!!
amen _comma_  me too .    i hate my current job . 
this is going to sound really pathetic _comma_  but i m so happy my new upholstery carpet cleaner arrived today .  now i can clean!
it s not crazy! i m all about cleaning up .  i love the smell of clean house
me too .  i live in a first floor apartment and it gets so dusty .  now i ll be able to clean the carpet and the couch! funny how some strange things lift your spirits . 
i find it very satisfactory to clean and vacuum :) i bet it will smell so good
hope so .  i m moving out of this apartment and into another one in a few weeks _comma_  so i want it to be really clean . 
my daughter is doing such a great job juggling so many things after having a baby that was premature . 
that s good .  i know that would be difficult . 
she really has become such a good mom .  i must have done something right ha ha
that is great .  i am sure you are proud and you should be!
i m moving into a new apartment soon .  i do hope that the neighbors are nice and quiet . 
that s always both an exciting time and a nerve wracking time .  i m in college and i had to move the past two years in a row .  this year  _comma_   i decided i kinda had enough and would just stay put  _comma_   even though the apartment was just so so .  do you like it well enough even if the neighbors may give you trouble?
not really _comma_  but my current upstairs neighbors are awful and i feel it d be worth moving just to get away from them!
oh yeah    _comma_     i know the type .  where they sound like they re having a parade at  am .  sorry you had to go through that .  luckily (or unluckily    _comma_     if you want to see it that way) i have a loud window ac unit in my apartment    _comma_     so even if they did make noise    _comma_     i couldn t hear them over it!
lucky you! and you re bang on about the  am parade   sounds like a herd of elephants .  maybe i should speak with the current tenant of my new place before moving   just to see how the neighbors are . 
two years ago we decided to sell off almost everything we owned and move into our rv so we could travel full time .  i was really scared and worried about literally everything lol . 
oh wow that is a huge commitment! how did it go?
it has been amazing! we have enjoyed every minute of the last   years .  my kids are seeing and experiencing things that they may have never been able to see or do .  
that is really awesome! im glad it all worked out for you!
thank you! we have had so much fun an di now realize that i had nothing to be so worried about lol . 
sometimes i look at old pictures of times in my life and kind of wish i could go back for a while .   do you ever feel like that?
yes i feel like that every time i look at old pictures!
it s good to know others feel the same .   i mean  _comma_   i love my life right now  _comma_   but sometimes it would be nice to go to something simpler for a bit . 
i agree and time jut goes by too fast!
i was looking at old pictures the other day and kind of wishing i could go back to those times in my life . 
do you reach out to your friends from your childhood?
as much as i can _comma_  but some have gotten far enough away that i m not sure how to track them down anymore . 
exhaust all options _comma_  social media is a big way to stay connected
sometimes i m just surprised and amazed at the kindness of others .  recently  _comma_   one of the maintenance men in our complex delivered a package to me  _comma_   without my saying anything!
wow!  what was in the package?
it was a carpet upholstery cleaner and is quite heavy .  i m disabled  _comma_   so wouldn t have been able to carry it .  they don t normally do deliveries  _comma_   so i thought that was really nice of him to do that . 
that was really nice!  what a wonderful surprise!  this act of kindness helps to restore my faith in humanity . 
the service they provide is so considerate and thoughtful .  i d probably move out of the complex if it wasn t for the staff!
my friend and i used to play nintendo all day long .  it was fun! we used to play ninja turtles and other fun games .  gosh _comma_  i miss her so much
nice do you still keep in touch with her
yes but she lives in a different country _comma_  different time zone so we barely have time to talk .  i wish she lived closer
well if you stay in touch then i m sure she ll come back . but in the meantime try to take your mind off her or get involved in something fun so you have cool stories to tell her
for me _comma_  one of life s greatest pleasures is to be sitting on my porch with a good book and a glass of wine . 
what book do you enjoy reading?
lots of things .  i like historical novels and legal dramas best .  what about you? does reading give you a sense of relaxation?
no _comma_  actually i m under a lot of stress right now and i m in pretty dire straights financially .  the only book i m really reading at this time is the bible . 
there s no finer book to help you in distressful times than the bible .  i hope it gives you a sense of peace to read it .  so sorry to hear you re stressed out . 
my cousin recently sent me a video from her phone of my home village .  what i saw made me mad and sad!
where is your home village?
in the north of scotland .  it used to be a quiet little place _comma_  and now there are hideous buildings in really prominent places!
that s a shame .  i m sorry to hear that . 
me to .  i was even considering moving back there some day _comma_  but not after seeing the mess the planners have made of it . 
do you live in the united states now?
yes .  i ve been here for about    years now and love it .  but there s something about where i grew up which pulls (or rather pulled) me back . 
yes it sounds like it was a great place to grow up . 
i love taking care of my little dog i give him everything he need
i love dogs! what breed is he?
he is a french puddle and i love him very much
that s so sweet! we have blue healers _comma_  they just make the world better . 
one time as a surprise for my birthday _comma_  my college friends  kidnapped me 
oh my goodness _comma_  that must have been terrifying until you figured out what was going on . 
nah   i knew that they were just having fun with me!  i was blindfolded and put in the trunk of a big car (i am tiny) . 
well at least you had a good time .   did they do something nice for you after?
well they took me to a local fountain and dunked me in it!  it was warm out so it was funny and i liked that they cared about me . 
i cant stand seeing homeless people in the street _comma_  i get really angry and sad at the same time
do you ever offer to help thm?
yes i go to my local charity every weekend
good for you _comma_  i feel bad for never helping out . 
i won      on a scratch off the other day . 
awesome .   what are you going to do with the money . 
i m really not sure .  i was shocked to win that much .  
don t spend it all in one place :)
i ll try not to .  i ll probably just save it :)
putting it away for a rainy day is the best bet .  _comma_ 
i was really lonely and depressed at one point _comma_  and i had a dinner date with a potato i put googly eyes on . 
haha  _comma_   that s a nice way to enjoy a sad moment  _comma_   how are you feeling recently?
much better  _comma_   thanks :)  yeah  _comma_   i was really just doing anything to feel a connection . 
i m happy to hear you re doing better .  if you feel that way again please reach out . 
i woke up and the first thing i saw that my cat had decided to play with my shoes and ruin them!
oh my _comma_  you must have been annoyed with your cat .  i guess he just wanted your attention . 
i was so mad! i felt so bad being mad at him 
aw he s just a kitty after all .  i m sure he didn t mean to make you mad . 
i was confident that i was going to win that prize
what prize was it    _comma_     or what was the competition    _comma_     rather? i m interested to know    _comma_     but don t want to pry    _comma_     if you don t feel like saying . 
it was a     visa gift card .  the competition was a talent show .  i didn t win unfortunately but it s ok
ah  _comma_   gotcha .  it s good to see that you tried and that you care that much .  most people are too lazy or scared to compete in things  _comma_   myself included .  i hope you continue to do the things that make you competitive and interested . 
we decided to try and buy a new kind of sausage from the store .  it s super cheap
was it any good?
it was! i was super nervous about it though cause of how cheap it was 
sometimes the cheap things are the best
it is really hard going to the hospital to visit my grandmother
i bet it is! when my grandma was alive it was so heartbreaking to see her in pain .  she broke her hip right before her death and she just couldn t recover
yeah it is the worst having someone in the hospital
i hope she will recover soon .  stay strong and think positive
i m going to my home country next tuesday and i m so excited i can t sleep!! it s been   years since i ve seen my parents
where is that ?
kazakhstan .  i miss it and i miss my parents and friends so much
isnt that where bruno is from ?
not bruno but borat lol such a stupid movie .  i honestly can t stand that actor and his toilet humor
i am super proud of my parents for graduating college
that s great that they accomplished that and even better that you recognize their achievements . 
yeah _comma_  they are truly an inspiration that anyone can go to college no matter the age
ok i didn t realize that they may have gone after you were born as opposed to before . 
i am prepared to go camping tonight in the woods
i am prepared to go camping tonight in the woods
aren t you afraid of the wild animals that will be roaming the area?
i came home one day and found that my dog had unzipped my bookbag  _comma_   gotten a sandwich i had forgotten i brought home from lunch  _comma_   and opened the bag it was in without damaging it to eat it . 
that sounds peculiar .  i ve never known a dog with such finesse _comma_  yours may have talent . 
he s an evil genius .   he tried to get toys out of a christmas stocking one time by climbing on the coffee table . 
that s really cool _comma_  it makes me want to consider getting a dog . 
i am impressed in my sisters camping skills .  they are very good
what did she do ?
we went camping and she prepared everything rather quickly including the tents
wow that was nice of her
i am confident that i will win the gaming tournament in chicago
what kind of gaming is it?
shooting game
that s sounds interesting!
when i go up with my skydiving students i feel proud when they do well
i d imagine so .   how long have you been a sky diving instructor for?
i have been instructing for    years but skydiving for   
aweseme .   i want to go skydiving sometime . 
you shoudl definitely try it!
well _comma_  recently at physical therapy i walked the length of the treatment room with the help of a cane .  i m feeling quite good about that!
wow thats a good job
considering i ve been using a walker for the past two years _comma_  yes it is .  thanks!
keep it up!
every day i practice   i ll be back on the golf course in no time _comma_  lol . 
i am so upset that a public road in front of my house closed because of a limestone mine . 
that sounds frustrating .  how did it affect you?
it is hard because cars come up the road all the time and turn around in my drive . 
ooh _comma_  that would be aggravating .  i guess there isn t much you can do . 
i just have to wait for the city to fix the collapsed road and reopen the road again . 
i am hopeful that i will win my ebay bid
best of luck! what are you bidding for
i am bidding on a rare comic book
archie? marvel? dc?
i was walking home one time and a really big dog came charging out from a house at me barking really loudly . 
sometimes dogs just bark a lot .  did anything happen?
thankfully not really  _comma_   it stopped near me and barked a lot until someone got it  _comma_   but it was really frightening until it was retrieved . 
thank goodness .  i d be scared _comma_  too .  you can t really know whether a dog is harmless or not sometimes . 
it is incredible to see how technology has advanced these past days
it has _comma_  what did you see that impressed you?
well the phones are basically a      s computer
they re more powerful than that .  more like an early      s computer . 
i ate an entire cake last night 
what did i tell you about doing that .  it was a chocolate cake right?
it was! i just couldn t stop! it was so good that i just had to keep eating 
ok _comma_  at least it was the right kind of cake you liked .  but still not a good thing . 
i am prepared to help my family financially whenever they need it
that is really great .   you don t find too many people willing to help others financially .   do you have a really good job?
ehh _comma_  its not the best but it s not bad either\
it s good just to have enough these days . 
i was afraid when i saw that horror film in the theater
which film was it?
it was the first purge
i haven t heard of it _comma_  sounds interesting though . 
wandering around my little area of the world i am quite pleased with the variety of stores and restaurants here .  i didn t expect it . 
that s good .  i live in a small town but we have a big shopping center across the street and there are all the stores i love 
nice! you just don t expect it in a rural area .  well _comma_  i didn t anyway .  we have large grocery stores and a little (but very good) organic grocery store .  quite incredible . 
wow even organic store? that s pretty cool
i find it hard to believe    _comma_     myself! this is the rural south    _comma_     yet there are fine dining restaurants    _comma_     the aforementioned store    _comma_     really good independent stores selling all sorts of stuff . 
i hate when i do dishes and touch food that was on the plate ! so gross .  makes me wanna throw up
really? it doesn t bother me at all .  i wonder why you feel that way?
because the food is all soggy and mushy .  i don t know _comma_  such a yucky feeling
well    _comma_     most people have intense likes and dislikes .  personally    _comma_     i can t stand cigar smoke    _comma_     but some people love it! i guess in your case    _comma_     you need to scrape the food off the plate first . 
i really hate when my kids leave their dirty clothes on the floor
i can imagine they are a right pain to pick up after!
yeah they even have a bin specially for that
what an annoyance!
i hate people that cut lane in traffic without signaling it
oh me too .  i m not a driver but that is so annoying . 
yeah it really makes me mad to see that people dont care about these types of things
it can be really dangerous too
i found a rabbit that had been shot by someone in my yard
that is terrible .   was it dead or just injured?
thank goodness it was dead  _comma_   poor thing is not suffering  _comma_   but some people can be so cruel . 
that is true .   i would hate for people to be shooting things that close to my house _comma_  too .   do you know who it was?
we had been holding off trying a new restaurant in town . 
what s been holding you back?
it s a little pricey and i m worried i won t like the food and waste all that money .  it has good reviews though
that s a tough decision to make .  it s good to try new things sometimes and i m sure the waiters can recommend you a nice meal you ll enjoy based off your preferences . 
our local organic store now stocks indian food made by a local indian lady   heaven  _comma_   heaven  _comma_   heaven!
that is very cool!  i love when food is authentic .   do you shop there often?
about once a week .  her husband works in the store _comma_  so he brings her food in regularly .  it s such a pleasure to find such a thing   i missed my indian food!
i have never tried making indian food myself _comma_  but i do really enjoy indian restaurants .   i am jealous .   
well  _comma_   my uncle s indian and his sisters and mother taught my aunt to cook  _comma_   and she taught me .  but i m disabled right now so can t cook much .  this is such a find!
i have been working on  my jump shot all month . 
that s awesome!  have you gotten any better yet?
i hope so i have a big horse tournament against my buddies i want to win the     bucks prize . 
that would be cool .   hopefully the hard work will pay off
one of my neighbors (next building and two floors up) plays talk radio every morning very loudly . 
urgh that sounds like the worst! how early?
not until about  am _comma_  but it s so loud i can hear it in my first floor apartment with the doors and windows closed .  idiot man!
so inconsiderate! it reminds me of my neighbours doing building work one morning at  am!
yikes! why are some people such inconsiderate creeps? it makes me really mad!
me too! 
i ve called management twice about it and both times he quietened down   for about two days .  then up it goes again!
how many times do you need to tell them!? :(
nothing in life is certain _comma_  the only control you have is to decide what to do with the time that has been given to you . 
i tend to believe that those who have biblical faith do have a certainty _comma_  that god will bless them despite circumstances .  
i have just bought a ticket to a britney spears live show in vegas . 
oh really _comma_  when are you going to go see her?
the show is in three months _comma_  i hope she sings he late   s hits . 
i hope you have a good time at the concert _comma_  and she sings all the songs you re looking forward to . 
our property management team just emailed me to say i ve got the apartment i wanted!
congratulations! that must have been such a great feeling . 
it really was   i can t wait to move in! it s a smaller apartment _comma_  but quieter (i hope!) . 
i can t wait for the day i move out into my own place!
you ll get there .  it really is nice to have your own space .  do you live at home?
i do _comma_  i live with my parents because i m in university and i m still pretty young .  hopefully by next year!
good for you! start saving your money now   believe me _comma_  you ll need it!
i was on the patio and a giant roach crawled out from underneath . 
those are my nightmares .  they are so big where i live in the south . 
it was almost as bug as a golf ball i felt like throwing up . 
i would immediately start spraying bug spray all over .  those things terrify me .  
i have quite a long drive ahead of me next month .  it s about      hours _comma_  but i ve don it before so i ll be fine . 
i don t know how you do it .  i can t stand long drives . 
i put music on and open the window .  otherwise i ll disappear into my own little world _comma_  and that s not a good thing to do when you re driving!
definitely not! music is a great idea though; i listen to music on all bus rides and car rides . 
it really helps to pass the time  _comma_   not to mention it can calm you down .  and the drive s quite easy and very pretty  _comma_   which help . 
i was so amped yesterday .  i got to pick up my now computer for the store! 
thats awesome .   what kind of computer are you getting?
it was just a new model hp that i bought but i m so excited! 
very nice .   id be super excited too .   have some fun playing with it
i get my groceries delivered to my home and am so grateful for the service . 
yeah it is really nice to have other people do your shopping
it helps me a lot as i m disabled and it can be quite difficult .  anyway _comma_  i hate grocery shopping!
shopping is no fun _comma_  waiting in lines is not fun . 
ugh .  and don t even get me started on  mini shoppers  racing round the aisles screeching! much better to have someone else buy for me!
i just watched the notebook _comma_  pretty depressing movie . 
i haven t heard of that movie .  what s depressing about it?
it s a romantic love story .  doesn t end so well for the main character . 
oh dear .  i think i ll give it a miss   i cry at the drop of a hat! you should watch a comedy next _comma_  just to cheer yourself up!
my little boy learned how to  count to ten eeven know he is super young
ohhh cute!! i am so happy for you _comma_  smart boy!
yeah i was so proud of him as well i thought i would have to wait months till he got to that point
a rare one _comma_  i hope he goes a long way and maybe even be the next einstein we need
i just went to the park today . 
what did you do there?
i was going to hang out _comma_  but i ended up tripping and smashing my toe up into a rock . 
sounds painful _comma_  did you have to go to the doctor?
my little brother dumped a glass of water on me this morning to wake me up
oh god _comma_  that must have been the worst way to wake up in the morning
yeah i was furious we are in some sort of a prank war
oh _comma_  do you have any revenge planned?
last night there was a really strange animal screaming outside my window in the middle of the night 
that is really scary!  what was it?
turned out to be a skunk! it sounded so strange! 
yuck!  stay away from that guy!
when i was in college i travelled all over europe one semester . 
sounds like quite an adventure for one semester! what was your favorite place?
i love all over italy _comma_  but i also loved germany and france and spain . 
nice! must have made you really happy to see so many different places . 
yes it was truly an amazing time meeting people from so many different cultures
we went on vacation and the kids stayed home .  i couldn t believe it when i walked in the door and the house was totally clean . 
lol! i thought you were going to say messy! good kids!
wonders never cease to amaze me .  first time for everything i guess _comma_  lol
so true! maybe they want something or they did something bad and are hiding it lol
i totally thought the same thing .  too funny (but you might be right)
lol ;) well enjoy the clean house _comma_  don t worry about the rest!
i went ziplining the other day
oh awesome   _comma_    i love ziplining   _comma_    last time i went was   years ago tho   _comma_    how did you find it?
i found it using the internet .   it was a lot of hiking but they had a lot of long lines . 
did you enjoy yourself 
yes i did   i had a great time and met some fun people . 
i smashed my finger in the door last night 
ouch sucks to be you! jk did you ice it down
i iced it up but i was so mad because it was my fault for slamming the door 
yes hope you feel better
we might have to put our dog down soon . 
oh no .  i have been there before .  it was really sad . 
yes _comma_  she s getting older and she s just getting to that point she can t move around good . 
it is sometimes for the best but that doesnt always make it easy .  
i am really lucky that my cancer got cured many years ago
how did you do that? naturally or with chemo?
i did it with chemo and it took a lot of time and effort
i bet! look in too chlorella and similar to get rid of any toxins from the chemo :)
i am so ready to move . 
oh yeah? where you planning to move to?
california .  i m ready for my kids to try out some new schools and be happier :)
oh that s a very good reason to go _comma_  i am happy for you 
i cannot stand seeing people throw trash on the streets
this is what you need to do _comma_  get out of your car and go give them a beat down that they need
i know right i feel like doing that every time but i dont want to get arrested hahaha let karma get them _comma_ 
yea but it will feel better if you take action
 i am by myself most of the time in a isolated area .  i only have animals as my friends . 
oh does that sadden you?
sometimes it makes me sad _comma_  but than i think how happy my animal friends makes me feel .  
animals are far better than humans  _comma_   most humans have long lot their way and follow only their desires  _comma_   i am also like you and i embrace it and smile :) 
i bought     packs of magic cards and didn t get a single good card . 
what are magic cards?
collectible cards .  my friend bought only a few packs and got incredible cards . 
oh interesting! kind of like pokemon cards ?
i feel really bad that we have to board our dog when we go on vacation next week . 
oh that s sad  _comma_   i am sorry for this  _comma_   where are you going and what  will you do about your dog?
we are going to a place at the beach that doesn t allow pets with some friends .  our vet also has a kennel there to board dogs so i guess that s what we ll do .  she ll be so sad though . 
hmmm i got an idea _comma_  how about when you come back you give her an amazing time? 
i actually recently applied for a few jobs myself _comma_  crossing my fingers for something better than my current one . 
well i hope that you find something .  any particular reason that you are job hunting?
current job doesn t pay enough _comma_  i m waiting for the stars to align and something better to come along . 
keep it up and i m sure something will turn up!
i just bought some tickets to win the price at the state fair . 
how lucky you feeling?
i know its not likely but i really want to win the new mustang
well if it s worth anything i give you my luck! i hope you win that mustang!
i am so scared to live in my neighborhood .  there is people that come around shooting their guns . 
that sounds dangerous! you should try to move
i have been thinking about moving but i have lived here for over    years .  the area has changed so much . 
you really should! with things like that happening you could get seriously injured
my fear is that i wont find a safer place .  not much money to find a good neighborhood to move into . 
i went out to the country to gaze at some stars . 
cool! that sounds like a great time!
i was overwhelmed by the enormity of the universe . 
wow that s pretty deep!
my kids birthday was last weekend _comma_  my whole family showed up! they didn t even tell me they were coming
wow _comma_  that had to be quite a surprise .   i hope you like them
yea  _comma_   i do .  hah .  they live a few states away  _comma_   which is why it was so unexpected .  don t see them often . 
well thats good .   hopefully it was a good party!
bought two pairs of shoes recently . 
what brand are they?
yeezy s _comma_  the worst part is the second pair of shoes were both right footed . 
that is crazy did you go return them maybe?
i read the instructions to set up my fit bit     times . 
and what happened?
i need it to work perfectly i need to get ready for a marathon and i need it to track my progress . 
how long is a marathon?
i have a big speech to give . 
are you nervous?
well i don t really know many of the people i will be in front of _comma_  so hopefully i don t stutter or something . 
good luck!
i left my purse at in the seat in starbucks . 
oh no! i hope no one took it!
i was in a safe neighborhood so i wasn t worried . 
did you go back for it and get it?
i was able to say the entire alphabet backwards . 
wow ! thats quite an accomplishment .  how long did you have to practice to perfect that ?
no time  _comma_   i have a great memory  _comma_   it was on a dare i nailed it perfectly . 
fantastic ! when you get older _comma_  your memory tends to play tricks on you lol
i have been looking at pictures of crazy car crashes . 
oh really? any interesting ones?
seriously now i can t drive anywhere .  i can t even leave the house for fear of car crashes . 
that s awful! sounds like it might have caused you some trauma unfortunately . 
i was at the mall yesterday .  i sat down for a few minutes and when i looked away someone stole my shopping bags . 
did you catch the person after?
no .  i didn t notice right away .  how could someone do that .  im so so mad!
that is unreal _comma_  what did you have in the bags?
i was in a hospital and a guy game in with some really bad burns . 
oh my gosh .  what happened to him?
no idea _comma_  but i had never seen something like that in person .  it looked painful . 
i bet is was .  are you ok?
i saw a guy deadlift    lbs at the gym the other day .  i was in awe . 
oh my god _comma_  that is a lot of weight!
yeah it is _comma_  it seemed like he had every plate in the gym on the bar .  i ve never seen someone lift that much in person before . 
that s really cool _comma_  i honestly can t even imagine someone lifting that much!
i got to go to a cat cafe when no one else was around! 
i ve been to one before with my girlfriend _comma_  what an amazing experience eh?
it was! i was the only one around so all the cats came to spend time with me 
aren t you the luckiest? 
i walked out to my car theo ther day and felt something hit my face .  
really? what was it?
a giant spider! it was terrible and i was so startled! 
oh gross! i would be startled too!
when i can home _comma_  my cat was laying on the pile of laundry that i had pulled out of the dryer before work .  now it s covered in hair . 
you must be mad at the cat for that . 
well it s pretty inconvenient _comma_  that s for sure .  nothing i can really do about it now .  just got to keep the door closed i guess .  
you got too _comma_  my cats dont do that thankfully . 
today when i went into my roommate s office to fix the internet _comma_  i noticed the collar of his old cat that passed away .  i miss her . 
i am so sorry to hear that .  we need memories of our fur babies to help us in our grief .  
yeah  _comma_   she wasn t my favorite cat  _comma_   but i still miss her .  cancer sucks .  
people do not realize that animals can get cancer too .   its more common than we may think .  
sometimes an old song runs through my head and i remember the times where i used to listen to songs so many times that i memorized the words
that sounds nice .  it s always good to remember better times .  what kind of music?
like old kind of emo songs _comma_  full of angst and whatnot
ha _comma_  i used to listen to that stuff back in high school .  the my chemical romance gets me every time . 
the other night when i was taking my dog out to go to the bathroom really late .  i heard some rustling in the bushes and panicked . 
guess you dog isn t one that s going to take the bullet?
oh she was ready to fight whatever it was   _comma_    but she was on a leash thankfully .  no   _comma_    i m just really easily started   _comma_    all that anxiety over an armadillo .  im so ashamed lol . 
lol i ve never seen an armadillo but that sounds freaky!
i found an injured bird in my yard today _comma_  it was only a baby to!
did you help it?
yes  _comma_   i had to call my local wildlife rescue center to come get it .  i hope its okay  _comma_   they said they think it has a broken wing . 
i hope it get s better! that sounded harsh
i have a friend coming over soon and i keep checking out the window to see if theyre here yet .

well then .  what a great surprise .  it sounds like you deserved it . 
i have a deadline at work coming up . 
for what kind of project?
it is top secret .  but every time i try and get serious work done _comma_  my co workers won t leave me alone . 
did you tell them to leave you alone?
my roommate has been gone all week .  i don t have anything to do without him here . 
what about doing something you enjoy? 
it s just not the same doing something by myself .  i don t have anyone to go do stuff with .  
i know it can be tough but maybe trying something new or outside your comfort zone might give you an enjoyable experience
we just adopted a dog from the shelter last week and i think she is sick with parvo . 
what is parvo?
it s a deadly dog illness _comma_  basically a virus that often leads to death .  we think she caught it at the shelter . 
that s terrible .  can you confirm it?
yes _comma_  they have to do a fecal sample and test it .  we take her in tomorrow to see . 
i hope she is okay .  
thank you!
we are planning on going on a cruise in december!
how ever so exciting! is this your first cruise?
no _comma_  i went on one in highschool but first one with my husband and daughter .  it s has been so fun planning it together!
i hope you have a great trip and cherish the time with your family!
i came home today and my roommate was cooking dinner _comma_  all i had to do was fix my plate .  it was so nice .

i hope it doesn t get too bad near you
my husband just got called back into work _comma_  was not expecting that!
why did he get called back in?
someone stole some gear _comma_  so they called everyone back to investiage .  we had just sat down to eat dinner to!
wow _comma_  did he get paid for it?
he is in the military so technically he can be called in      and is payed on salary!
i just prepared an amazing plate of mac and cheese . 
my sister loves mac and cheese .  she would probably live off of that if given the chance
it is so good if you add the right amount of pepper .  
i like paprika in my mac and cheese
i just bought a brand new necklace and shirt . 
what kind of necklace did you purchase? it s good to treat yourself some times .

you will just make sure you have your nice new shirt on with that cool necklace and you will be all eyes lol . 
my dog keeps having accidents in the house! i m getting fustrated . 
it could be a medical problem .  make sure its checked out . 
thank you  _comma_   i will .  i think she is doing it to mark her territory  _comma_   it started when we brought a new dog home . 
ohh i see .  that is super annoying .  hopefully she gets over this phase and they get along . 
when i was promoted to team leader at work   _comma_    i really felt like all my hard work had paid off   _comma_    to some extent   _comma_    and i gave myself a little pat on the back . 
you must have really proud of yourself .  its good to acknowledge your own achievements from time to time . 
yes  _comma_   and it can be difficult at times to move up at places  _comma_   especially when there are many other long timers there!
i agree _comma_  which is why getting into that position can be so gratifying .  hopefully you maintain that level of hard work that got you there . 
i can t wait to go to the water park this weekend . 
oh that sounds nice
yes _comma_  my kids love it so they are going to be so happy when we get there . 
sounds like a great time _comma_  hopefully its not too hot out there
i m just laying in bed with a scented candle burning in my room and my cat on my lap _comma_  things couldn t be any better . 
that sounds like heaven to me as well

my mom sent my daughter a toy i played with when i was a child!
oh thoughtful ! did she enjoy playing with it ?
yes  _comma_   it was neat to see her play with it .  it ll make some great photos  _comma_   since i have one of me playing with it at her age . 
its quite wonderful to share your childhood memories with your children isn t it ?

on a honeymoon _comma_  lol? not right away .  he is totally the man of my dreams .  i m so lucky
well i am happy for you
my husband might loose his job _comma_  i m not sure what we will do if he does .  
that is terrible .  why do you think that he will lose his job?
the company is downsizing and cutting a lot of departments .  his hasn t been cut yet but there are rumors!
i understand .  that is very stressful .  did he started looking for another jod? it could be solution . 
i found out my childhood cat passed away 
thats sad .  i love cats
i do too _comma_  it was so sad .  
how old was the cat?
my daughter is such a talented and creative young artist .  when she was nominated to be  most artistic  at school  _comma_   i felt very secure she would win  _comma_   because she really is amazing!
thats awesome .  did she?
she did! i know i m the parent so can be biased   _comma_    but it s really so impressive how well she draws   _comma_    paints   _comma_    shades . 
i bet you are so proud .  i would definitely be
i was very ready for my first car crash
why?
i had all the paperwork set and ready _comma_  i had a blanket cause it was in the winter . 
what happened after your car crashed?
last night a fly got into the bedroom and wouldn t stop trying to land on my face 
flies are so annoying
it was terrible! right as i was about to fall asleep the dang thing would land on my nose!
i had that problem with a mosquito once .  i woke up with a bite on the tip of my nose
i left my dog alone in the house when i went to get the mail .  while i was gone she got in the cat box and ate the cat poop _comma_  super gross . 
i would have hated to clean that up .  i wonder why they do that?
there was nothing to clean .  she definitely swallowed it .  i stuck her outside cause i can t even think about dealing with her licking anything right now .  gives me the hebbie jibbes thinking about it . 
yea that is so gross but also kind of funny .  i cant help but laugh . 
i have been practicing my speech for days now . 
do you have to give a big speech soon?
i have the perfect delivery and all the talking points drilled down .  i will be impressive
that s the way to go! practice and practice until you re confident and then the real thing will be a breeze . 
my cat puked up a hairball this morning and i had to clean it up . 
that is horrible .  does he puke up hairball often?
she pukes up hairballs every now and then i have some salmon flavored jelly i can feed her _comma_  but it happens so infrequently i forget to . 
i understand . 
when i left the bathroom in high school once i had toilet paper stuck to my shoe . 
i bet it was very embarrassing?
yeah it sure was _comma_  you know how mean teenagers can be .  it s like they have no empathy or think about what if it was them . 
it s alright we ve all been there many times . 
i got a new type of pizza i wanted to try
what kind of pizza is it?
a normal pepperoni but it was terrible!
thats never good _comma_  i love pizza
when i was in costa rica i was having a lot of trouble with the address of my airbnb _comma_  i was so lost . 
oh no! that must be so frustrating being in a foreign country
it was because my spanish was a bit lacking _comma_  it also didn t help that people kept giving me bad directions .  i eventually stumbled on it but for a while i was worried i would never make it there . 
i m glad you eventually found it and didn t have to sleep somewhere else . 
i was caught off guard when the gun fired for a race i was in
ahh _comma_  it happens .  i used to swim competitively so i would sometimes get stunned too when i hear the gun go off
yeah  _comma_   i forgot to take my sweat pants off  _comma_   that s when i realized running isn t for me
ahaha _comma_  i hate running too
i slept with a new girl last week
huh _comma_  ok .   do you like her a lot?
not really
sounds like you don t have much respect for women .   
not really .  we were very high .  we were drunk .  but now i feel bad for my partner
i was eating dinner with my husband last night and i was so happy
sometimes the simplest things are the nicest
i whole heatedly agree! it was just so freeing and peaceful
i hope you have many more then!
someone came to my door with a gun the other day . 
what did you do in response?
i called the police after he robbed me . 
that s awful _comma_  did you get injured at all?
no  _comma_   thankfully  _comma_   i m fine but scared . 
i left my food on the coffee table and my dog ate it . 
that is a terrible tragedy _comma_  my friend .  did the dog get sick?
no _comma_  she is fine .  i had to find something else to eat though . 
well that s good .  what did you find?
i was trying to study for a test one night and my brother was listening to loud music
did you ask him to turn it down?  or did you just go flip the circuit breaker to the house?
i would have totally flipped the circuit breaker if i knew how _comma_  but i just asked him to turn it down
did he do it?  cause if not   _comma_    i might have needed to give him a high five   _comma_    on the head   _comma_    with a chair . 
my dog tried to eat her poo
that is pretty disgusting! did it look like poo coming out again?
it probably will .  
i can imagine .  maybe it ll morph into a super saiyan poo or something . 
i borrowed a book from the library the other day but i left it outside
that s a dang shame .  did it get rained on?
yes it did _comma_  unfortunately 
that s too bad .  well     _comma_      on the bright side     _comma_      maybe a hobo will find it     _comma_      read it     _comma_      enlighten himself     _comma_      and get a job at mcdonalds . 
i got something nice the other day _comma_  chocolates from my husband
wow that must have been a surprise for you
it was _comma_  and he does that type of thing a lot . 
you got a great husband
i have problems with the city and their constant tax increase on my property . 
i know how you feel _comma_  it s terrible .  i actually moved to a completely different state due to hi taxes . 
maybe a move out of my state would be the answer and a blessing to the high taxes .  
it s worth it to consider .  i pay less than half in property tax than i used to . 
i always do the same _comma_  it s not had when they are perfect . 
always do the same what? what is perfect?
my girlfriend _comma_  how about you? do you have a partner?
i have been married for    years and we have been together    . 
wow .  looks like you are doing a good job . 
i close on my new house monday _comma_  i didn t think i was going to be able to purchase it but i believed in my mortgage adviser
i ve been through that process before and it was not easy .  good thing you had a good adviser . 
surprisingly it s been a painless process .  i m very thankful . 
you have been very lucky .  you should keep their business card in case you ever decide to buy another house . 
i gave my friend some money that she said she would pay back but she hasn t yet .  
i hate when that happens!
i really thought  i could count on her _comma_  but now i haven t even heard a word from her .  lesson learned i guess . 
that s how it goes .  i usually consider the money as a lost cause when lending to friends . 
i actually did this _comma_  i m terrible . 
did what?
i stole my mother s card details to pay for a subscription . 
i have too .  to pay for food though .  she told me that she would have paid if i asked but i am too proud . 
we are going to six flags this weekend and my kids want me to ride the roller coaster with them . 
sounds like found!   are you scared of roller coasters?  i love them!
i m really hesitant to get on .  it s been a long time since i ve ridden one and i don t think i m going to like it at all
i hope you do have fun!
when i lost my dog of    years i was devastated . 
i know how you feel! our dog of   years past away last week spring .  it can be so hard 
it is a horrible experience and i hope that i never have to go through it again _comma_  how did yours die?
same here .  we don t know .  he was perfectly fine the night before .  we woke up to find him passed away at the foot of our bed .  do you know how yours passed?
i think that in the past i have spent time caring about things that aren t important . 
what kind of thing?  you could always change that in the future . 
money mostly .  i just wish i could have enough of it to be set for life . 
of course  _comma_   but that is certainly not the most important thing in life  _comma_   i hope you realize now . 
i love thinking back to when i was growing up and the neighborhood we lived in .  so many great memories . 
that s such a great feeling . 
it really is .  all the neighbors were so close _comma_  we even spent holidays together .  it was like a really huge family all living together . 
that sounds really nice .  i don t know my neighbors at all
do you watch any youtube at all?
i watch everyday .  love youtube!
what type of content do you like watching?
i like self help   _comma_    motivation   _comma_    healthy living   _comma_    and a little bit of conspiracy . 
the other night i wanted cake when i woke up in the middle of the night 
oh i get those midnight cravings all the time!
the worst part was that there was a cake to be eaten! so i did! lmao
you want cake? cake is there? obviously you have to eat it! lol
my husband was teaching me how to make a steak .  the flame was so warm!
that sounds like a fun thing to do as a couple . 
it was but i was so sad that i was so scared 
why were you so scared?
i looked at my childhood photos the other day .  i remember alled the fun i used to ahve 
oh really _comma_  that sounds nice .  i miss childhood . 
i do to .  it was much easier then for me 
sometimes i feel as though our generation (assuming you re a few years around   ) really got a bad deal as far as the economy  _comma_   politics  _comma_   and the overall love in the country is concerned . 
i have to rely on my prayers and my belief in a high power to get me through not having a job and no money . 
things work out .  it doesn t seem like it but they do . 
i remind myself all the time that it will work out and all will be good again . 
it will .  i am sure of it . 
i was very sad when i found out that my neighbors houses were going to be demolished because the city ordered it . 
is the city going to build them new ones at least?
nope .  they bought them out at city valued tax prices and they have    days to find another place to live .  
well at least they bought them out and they won t be homeless .  still sucks though . 
i feel off my bike the other day .  it hurt . 
oh no! how badly did you hurt yourself?
a few scraps to my elbows but nothing major _comma_  i was just embarrassed . 
that doesn t sound too bad _comma_  it could have been much worse! 
hey _comma_  any interest in video games?
yes i do play some video games . 
great _comma_  i m anticipating the release of fallout:   how about you?
i ve heard some very good things about it .  it doesn t come out until november right?
isn t it annoying when your friends earn more money then you but you work just as hard . 
sometimes life isn t very fair .  i like to think of it as motivation to get a better job . 
very true .  i suppose i just get a bit jealous sometimes . 
it happens _comma_  i think it s part of human nature .  just try and focus on your own well being and you ll be alright!
i exams went really well this year _comma_  how has your year gone?
good for you! .   my year have been ok too so far . 
thanks _comma_  i am feeling a lot more confident in myself .  remember the year can only get better . 
you seem to be very hopeful!  that is great . 
had a good day today _comma_  i think i was prepared for everything .  how has your day been?
i m so glad to hear that! did anything in particular make it a good day? mine s been awesome too!
well i had a meeting with my boss who gave me a promotion today so i m over the moon! . 
sick _comma_  congratulations! time to celebrate right?
i got attacked by a swarm of bees a few months back .  needless to say it hurt . 
how awful  _comma_   besides painful  _comma_   it must have been scary!
it was _comma_  they we re absolutely furious with me for some reason . 
were you messing with them _comma_  maybe? or taking their honey?
do you remember the old video games you used to play?
i do _comma_  as if it were yesterday .  i remember most of my childhood through video games . 
the nostalgic moments when you play them again is brilliant .  you should try it . 
i really want to _comma_  but unfortunately my gamecube and n   no longer function .  also a few of my favorite games are scratched to heck . 
life seems to be going perfect right now _comma_  how about you?
i m glad to hear that! things are really going great for me too!
well that s even better news! i m feeling hopeful for the both of us . 
same here .  let s hope these good times stick around real long!
a girl i went on two dates with wanted a copy of my house key _comma_  yikes!
you barely even know her _comma_  what was she thinking?
i don t know _comma_  she said she needed a place to hang out between jobs .  stupid me actually gave it to her . 
i really hope she doesn t do anything bad to you .  you seem like a nice dude . 
hah _comma_  thanks .  so far so good . 
my girlfriend forgot to order the chinese food yesterday . 
so what happened? did you end up ordering some once you both remembered?
was annoyed and disappointed so i ended up having a sandwich instead .  bad times . 
people make mistakes _comma_  it happens .  
my dog puked all over the carpet a few weeks back . 
oh nasty! that must have been a heck of a pain to clean . 
was absolutely disgusting but luckily it did come out easy . 
i wouldn t have thought it would be so easy _comma_  that s good!
the other night i found my cat laying dead in the side of the road 
i m so sorry for your loss _comma_  it isn t easy losing a pet .  how are you doing?
it s tough .  i was crying so hard that i had to call my husband to come pick us up
understandably so .  i hope you feel better soon . 
my family dragged me along to visit an underground cave recently _comma_  i was pretty nervous .  
sounds pretty interesting .   how was it? did you like it?
it was nice _comma_  after i got over the fear from being    stories underground .  
wow _comma_  that much!   were you afraid to be trapped like those poor boys in thailand?
hah _comma_  no i wasn t thinking of being trapped .  it just seemed like more effort to breath for some reason . 
had a job interview the other day . 
how did that go?
i think it went alright _comma_  i was incredibly anxious about it . 
those always make me nervous too .  i hope it goes well for you!
ate my flatmates last chocolate bar earlier . 
well _comma_  i hope they said you could have it . 
nope _comma_  i do feel a bit guilty about it but they should have hid it better . 
you could always replace it for them since you know you shouldn t have taken it . 
i went bungie jumping with some friends but i was reluctant to jump . 
are you scared of heights?
yes  _comma_   i don t like heights at all .  i did eventually muster the courage to jump  _comma_   however . 
i bet that was the ride of your life . 
i always try to tell my kids they need to be kind and understanding to others _comma_  no matter what . 
i think those are very important lessons .  do they always listen?
they try but it s hard when there are so many bullies at school .  i wish other parents would try to do the same . 
i m a parent and i wish the exact same thing . 
do you know how much work goes into video games?
not entirely _comma_  but i do know depending on the game it can take hundreds of people . 
i was really impressed as some games it can take over    years . 
as a gamer _comma_  i d love to know more about the games that take that long to make .  which ones?
an old girlfriend contacted me looking for a one night stand _comma_  i had to decline .  
oh man! i hate one night stands!!
hah _comma_  they can be fun .  though my partner would not have appreciated it! 
oh .  yeah .  probably not haha . 
i went to a family reunion at my grandparents  house . 
that sounds like fun _comma_  how was it?
it was enjoyable for sure _comma_  and poignant too .   it brought up lots of memories of my childhood . 
i bet!  when i got to family reunions there s always so much reminiscing
i had a chance to sell my stake in ice juice for a nice little profit . 
ooh _comma_  did you go ahead and go through with it?
no _comma_  i want to keep it because i have faith in the company doing really well longterm . 
nice _comma_  that s a good idea .  good luck!
my daughter started kindergarten recently _comma_  i walked her in and met her teacher . 
was she nice?
very nice _comma_  i just cant believe how grown up my little girl is getting .  
how old is she?
i lent my brother     dollars so he could buy cryptokitties . 
may i ask what a cryptokitty is? i am unfamiliar . 
i really couldn t tell you some kind of digital cat  _comma_   he says he will pay me back  _comma_   so hopefully it all works out . 
does he ask for money a lot or is this a first?
everyone wanted to go skydiving for my birthday . 
do you like skydiving?  i would be terrified!
i m pretty sure that my greatest fear is my chute not releasing and plunging through the sky into the ground .  oh well you only live once . 
haha _comma_  that s true but you can also live with your feet on the ground!
i didn t notice but i was walking around all day with a sock on my shirt! 
haha that s hilarious! where was it at on your shirt?
on my back! i went to work like this! 
oh no! i hope your coworkers went easy on you about it .  you must ve had a lot of static electricity . 
someone decided to slash my car tires  _comma_   key my car  _comma_   and bash in my windshield .  
how awful!  do you know who did it?
probably a spurned former lover .  glad i had insurance . 
yes at least there is that .   but it must be really scary to deal with someone willing to go that far . 
i have to give a speech at my fathers funeral .  i drew the short straw . 
it must have been a very difficult  speech _comma_  specially since i imagine you were really sad and moved . 
not really _comma_  i just needed to make sure that it goes off without a hitch .  i don t want to embarrass my mother . 
of course _comma_   do you feel prepared to do it then?
i ve been working at my same job for    years . 
wow .  that s quite the feat nowadays .  do you still enjoy it?
yes i do .   its a fun job . 
is it a  never worked a day in your life  situation?
yes i am a skydiving instructor so it is fun
oh wow _comma_  yes i would imagine that is fun .  i am jealous . 
yes i love it
on a recent trip there was some bad weather that caused my flight to be delayed several hours .  it was already late so i was afraid they would cancel the flight altogether . 
that is no good!  did you manage to get on it?
yes! thank goodness .  they didn t cancel .  i just got home much later than i had hoped . 
that is lucky .   at least you made it home the same day . 
absolutely .  i had too much to do the next day to not show up then . 
i literally ate all you could eat at a chinese buffet
lol _comma_  i bet you couldn t move after that . 
i had to go home and lie down for the greatest nap of my life . 
i bet _comma_  although with chinese you can eat it again in an hour or so . 
recently went on a family vacation to an old spot we used to go when we were all younger .  it was nice to see old stuff and talk about old times . 
sounds very nice  _comma_   you must have felt nostalgic for the old times  _comma_   right?
oh for sure .  i m always a sucker for nostalgia . 
yes me too _comma_  it is for that reason i avoid looking and old pictures when i don t want to go that way . 
i love looking through them .  i even find myself clicking back to my oldest pictures on facebook and reliving those times in my head . 
one night during college i got a phone call in the middle of the night that one of my best friends had been killed in a car wreck . 
that sounds terrible! you must have been devastated!
absolutely .  it was really the first time i had lost someone close to me _comma_  family or friend . 
it was a terrible way to comes to term with dead _comma_  i m so sorry you have to go through that .   i hope time have healed you . 
my birthday was a few days ago _comma_  i can t believe my wife had the wait staff sing to me . 
i love when i m at a restaurant and that happens .  happy birthday _comma_  by the way!!
hah  _comma_   its good entertainment  _comma_   but i don t exactly enjoy being in the spotlight .  thanks!
everyone always looks so happy and it makes people around you happy _comma_  but i understand not wanting to be in the spotlight
i recently got married and i m so lucky to have found someone who enjoys doing the same things that i do . 
congrats! it is nice to find someone with things in common .  shared interests can be fun . 
thank you .  it is nice .  this is a second marriage for us both and i like that we are both happy with things just the way they are _comma_  no high expectations
i m on my  nd as well .  i like to think that we will do things more wisely the second time around .  best of luck to you both!
i lost my wallet last week
oh that is the worse .   dis you find it at any point?
my friend freaked out but i was pretty sure i left it at a restaurant and i trusted in my fellow humans to turn it in
and who was right in this case?  dis anyone turned it in?
yes it was turned in   cash and credit cards all there
i recently had the opportunity to help out at my local second harvest food bank . 
that is so sweet of you! how was your experience?
it was great .  i was with a good group of people too .  we made it fun . 
i bet it feels good to know that you re helping those in need _comma_  too!
for sure .  i am happy i had the opportunity .  im sure i will do it again . 
i m happily married and employed _comma_  life is in a pretty good spot right now . 
that is awesome _comma_  having a significant other and a good job can make a huge difference! 
for sure .  i ve had some unstable times in my life .  i m thankful to be where i am now . 
those times can help shape you and make you appreciate the good times even more!
absolutely! 
it is always awesome when work and married life get along _comma_  without getting in the way of each other .  
yesterday my car ran out of oil and broke down .  i could not believe i would let such a thing happen!
oh no! did it do any meaningful damage?
the engine is totally shot _comma_  its not designed to run without any .  so now i have to go shopping for a new car .  
ouch .  new car is cheaper than replacing the engine?
the new car is more expensive than a new engine .  but i can t justify such a costly repair on my car .  
yeah i get that .  plus i guess the value goes way down doing something like that . 
it does drops a lot after a repair like that .  i might as well invest that money into something new .  
i was in a big party city and the street was crowded with people .  as i was walking my foot got tangled up on something and i went face first into a huge flower bed . 
ouch! that must have hurt . 
it hurt my pride more than it hurt my face . 
don t worry _comma_  people won t remember within a few months . 
that is true .  plus it was a big party area so im sure a lot of them drunk anyway . 
that s what i was thinking . 
literally anytime i order something online and i get the tracking i immediately start checking it .  i am so impatient waiting on stuff to come . 
yes i know i am like that too  _comma_   i can t wait for my new stuff to arrive  _comma_   i feel like a child on christmas waiting for santa s gifts . 
yes .  every single time .  i know better .  but i just cant help myself but to check over and over
i guess it is kind of fun anticipating the arrival of the packages . 
that is true . 
my dog died of old age last year and i miss her
how sad to lose a dog you love! ta least she he died of old age _comma_  she must be in doggy heaven . 
yes .   she was the most wonderful dog ever
i know how you feel  _comma_   there must be two of them though  _comma_   because my dog is the most wonderful dog ever too!
laugh!  yes dogs are far better creatures than humans
i m gonna take the family out to the lake this weekend _comma_  we might rent a boat .  
that sounds like a great way to spend the weekend .   what type of boat are you thinking about renting?
maybe a pontoon boat _comma_  depends on what they have .  should be a nice way to unwind . 
absolutely _comma_  nothing like unwinding after the work week .   i hope you 
i have a friend with loaded parents .  she doesn t work but has anything she wants anytime she wants . 
wow _comma_  must be nice .  my parents were really poor  still are .  
mine aren t poor but they aren t loaded .  they struggle .  same for me .  i work my butt of for what i have . 
yeah me too .  i like that though _comma_  i like earning my way .  
same .  i do wish i had a little bit more money to do a few more things though . 
i often dream about winning the lottery!
i had to do a lot of learning to knock out a big project at work .  finally finished and ready for another . 
hey _comma_  good for you! that takes stamina .  what was the project?
for sure .  it was a software coding project for a client .  a lot of which i did not understand at the start . 
well done! that was a challenge .  
thank you .  but now i have it ready for the next one . 
it always feels good to wrap up a big project .  
i have many health problems that require me to see many different speccialist
that s awful!  will you be feeling better any time soon?
i am working towards that . i have been lucky to find some great doctors which i am able to put faith in because my life is essentially in their hands
i am so glad you have doctors that you can trust!
i had a super stressful week and ended up cheating on my diet last night by eating pizza and cake . 
uhoh .  hopefully you were able to stick to your diet throughout the week _comma_  though .  one off day ain t so bad .  
yes _comma_  otherwise i had stuck to it   but my weekly weigh in was this morning and i was up two pounds .  i felt so irritated!!!!
that sounds it .  as long as you keep with it though  _comma_   results have to happen .  the hardest part of dieting has got to be the hiccups  _comma_   anyway .  
i m a bit nervous  i have an upcoming certification exam to take for my teaching license and it s a big deal . 
that s an amazing accomplishment!  i m sure you ll do great!  have you been studying a lot?
i ve been studying a whole lot   so i think i ll do okay _comma_  but it s still making me feel nervous . 
i hope you can stay calm _comma_  you seem really well prepared!
there was a group project due and we had a meeting _comma_  but i missed it because it was my   st birthday .  wasnt my best day

yeah _comma_  but i learnt from it and also had a good birthday!
thats good dear _comma_ congratulations
i have many health problems but i feel so lucky to have a great support system in my family
it is very important to have a good support system with health issues _comma_  especially if there are many .  it helps to know that you have people that are there if you need them . 
it really is!  it is wonderful to know how much they love me!
health problems can have a devastating effect on a person if they are alone _comma_  so it is wonderful that you have love and support . 
i was so sad when i had to put my dog down last year
oh .  i m sorry .  how old was your dog?
she was    .   it was old age but it was so hard because i had had her for years . 
have you thought about getting another dog? 
i wanted to buy a new car _comma_  but i wasn t sure about buying the one i got . 
it s a hard decision _comma_  you can be apprehensive about making the right decision you know?
yeah  _comma_   it s been a good car so far  _comma_   but most cars are pretty reliable at first . 
yeah they are! so that is really good!
i have an amazing husband who is always there for me no matter what
that sounds amazing! how d you guys meet?
he was my sisters _comma_  husbands roomate in college and he came down for their wedding and we met there .   i can t imagine my life without him
oh wow _comma_  that s awesome .  is your sister as happy with her husband as you are with yours?
one time i went to my friends   th birthday party .   when i was walking in her house i ran smack into their glass door .   it was so clean that i didn t see it .

that s very sweet .  i am certain he is with you .  
i have many health problems that have prevented me from having children
oh my .  i am so sorry .  that must be so difficult .  are you exploring any other options like adoption? 
if i can get my health under control i would definetly look into that .   i use to be very sad everytime i saw people with their children but i have finally learned to be content in my situation
i hope you are able to have a child some day .  i truly hurt for anyone that struggles in situations like this .  i have to aplogize in advance .  the topic i chose was about my daughter .  i do not want to make you feel sad .  
i had a job interview that was very important to me once
did you go for the interview?
yes _comma_  i prepared as best i could and i really felt that i aced it!  sure enough i ended up getting the jon
thats lovely _comma_ congrats
i used to live out of my car and it made me feel pretty down on myself back then
i no how you feei i have had to live in worse places than that  _comma_  but it looks like you found a way out of that situation . 
what types of situations? and yeah it could have been worse but i m glad i m out of it . 
i had to squat in houses before .  i m glad things have changed for you and for me . 
skydiving taught me how to let go and stop trying to fix everything
wow .  that s amazing .  were you afraid to try it?
yeah the hardest part for me was just realizing that i wouldn t be in control _comma_  but it was very natural in the end
do you often feel like you want to be in control? cause i totally do . 
it s like something you have to figure out with your heart _comma_  kind of like how caterpillars have to stop trying to do a bunch of work so they can become butterflies
i ended up watching all the robin william movies i could think of last weekend . 
lol! which one was your favorite?
i don t know if there is one of my favorites _comma_  but it sure was a lot of good memories . 
did you watch mrs .  doubtfire?
i was in a rush this morning and didn t realize i had put on two different colored sox . 
i hate it when that happens .  i hope your pants covered them at least .

that would be embarrassing!
i have been working on my dance moves for the last   months .

wow _comma_  going out in style! well i hope you found a good job somewhere . 
i appreciate the place where i started cuz it helps me keep going
like where you were born?

was it a rough place to grow up?
i have been working on at the track to get my sprint times faster 
wow that s awesome! are you on a team?
no   _comma_    just me   _comma_    but my     yard dash is so so slow   _comma_    i can t even get lower than   seconds . 
i don t know what s good for sprints _comma_  i m more of a distance runner myself . 
i think i m just really bad _comma_  maybe i will always be slow . 
i think you can get better dude!
drinking a gallon of milk everyday makes me feel like an absolute madman in the gym who s gonna take over the world
that doesn t sound healthy lol .  does it ever make you sick?
that s not the point _comma_  gotta do it raw
are you drinking  % because you think you re fat? because you re not .  you could drink whole if you wanted to . 
i had this juicy pump at the gym from doing some benching and it felt too easy
what .  i m confused .  what s a juicy pump .  like a juicer?
my pecs were poppin
oh .  hahahahahaha .  you go!
i was hurrying around the house and wasn t paying attention fully _comma_  i ending up hitting my toe on my dogs toys . 
dang dogs leaving their things around!
it really hurt _comma_  i think i may need to take all his toys away to punish him . 
yeah _comma_  minus one for dogs
i was at my main girls house and i saw these texts from this guy named chad
that doesn t sound good _comma_  sounds like you are getting replaced . 
yeah  _comma_   i demoted her to my dinner girl  _comma_   now i gotta choose who my main ting is gonna be
maybe you should just go single for a while and enjoy freedom . 
i got mad because i was too full to finish my plate at the buffet
what kind of buffet? did you get to take a doggie bag at least?
chinese  _comma_   but no i decided not to  _comma_   don t think would allow it
i bet you wish you had that doggie bag now .  my mom used to sneek food out .  lol
i spent    dollars on a piece of cheese cake . 
oh my  _comma_   i hope it was delicious  _comma_   that is a lot of money
i thought it would blow my mind but it was dry and really disappointing .  talk about a let down .  
goodness  _comma_   i would be so upset  _comma_   that is a terrible experience!
i have been working on my bench press for   months _comma_  i know i can get to bench     pounds .

steak and maximum effort .  i also drink lots of water _comma_  i m on the next level like arnold . 
good game m  _comma_  pics or it didn t happen
paranormal activity is the scariest movie of horror movies

yeah you ll have to show me sometime
i have a chucky doll sitting in the chair next to me and it looks at me all day .  now thats a movie . 
i just gave up smoking cigarettes .  it was pretty hard _comma_  but the worst part is how everything puts you on edge and it is hard to relax . 
oh wow  _comma_   i wish i could find the courage to do that  _comma_   it surely takes a lot of will power .  how did you do it 
i closed my eyes and visualize a world where anything was possible .  i called this world imagination land . 
i will totally have to try that _comma_  it really is difficult to stop smoking!
i was challenged to a dare by my best friend!
did you have the choice between truth and dare?
no _comma_  the challenge was i had to spend the night in a cemetery .  no flashlight no tents just a rolled up sleeping bag . 
dang _comma_  street cred off the chains right there
i enjoy getting things done
what kind of things do you like to do?
i like to crochet and pay the bills
why do you like to pay the bills _comma_  maybe you should just get a rich girl or guy to take care of it . 
i was so satisfied with myself when i left the gym today
did you have a good workout?
indeed   _comma_    it was quite thrilling   _comma_    did a little chest workout   _comma_    got a nice pump
nice!  i really need to get back to the gym . 
my cat puked all over my roommates shoes .  i feel so bad . 
oh _comma_  that s terrible!  what did you do?
i clean them up as best i could _comma_  and told him about it .  then i profusely apologized . 
did you figure out what made your cat puke?
i was really sick the other day and i let my roommate pick me up and carry me down the stairs . 
oh no! what was wrong? are you feeling better?
i had an ovarian cyst _comma_  it hurt so bad .  i almost went to the er again . 
oh man! i had one when i was pregnant with my son .  i feel your pain!
i was going through my photos today and i saw a picture of me and my ex together .  it just made me feel odd _comma_  i miss him . 
nice _comma_  when did you guys break up
we broke up back in may _comma_  he was just too much of a workaholic .  
i see _comma_  you ll find someone better
i get pretty sad some nights _comma_  but it feels good to cry sometimes
oh _comma_  why are you crying? is anything wrong in particular? have you talked to somebody?
yeah _comma_  sometimes it s like a deep sadness comes out of nowhere
oh i m sorry _comma_  i hope you get the help that you need . 
i had just been returning home _comma_  and on the side of the road there was some roadkill .  it used to be a deer . 
oh no .  that s quite unfortunate for the deer .  did you just drive past it?
yeah but my widows were down _comma_  and i could almost taste the stench of decay . 
i m sure you wanted to get out of there as soon as possible . 
sometimes it s impossible to shove more food down my gullet
do you have a medical condition?
nah  _comma_   i m trying to gain some pounds  _comma_   i just haven t acclimated to the quantity yet
are you trying to gain muscle?
i just watched jfk s speech _comma_   we will go to the moon    reminds me of what i admire in the us
i love the usa .   
it s really moving _comma_  wonder what the next big goal will be for humanity
jfk s speeches were amazing .   we have had a lot of great leaders in our country .   our country has truly been blessed .   
the litter of puppies had been born!
nice _comma_  amazing to witness birth
all of the puppies survived _comma_  truly a lucky amazing occasion!
good to hear _comma_  have fun with puppies!
i was totally caught off guard as a kid when the entire yard was covered in easter eggs
wow _comma_  who was the won who littered your yard with easter eggs?
my dad _comma_  but he wouldn t admit it! haha
nice _comma_  he probably made you pick them all up too!
i was a little nervous to eat some cloves of garlic for the first time
what made you nervous about it?
i wasn t sure if it was going to make me sick or not
i see .  is it your favorite food now? :p
i accidentally left a book i borrowed from a friend outside
were you able to get it back?
i did but it was ruined from the rain . 
well _comma_  hopefully your friend will forgive you . 
i forgot to take some water bottles out from under my cart and pay for them at the store .  i didn t realize i didn t pay for them till later . 
oh no! i ve done that before too
hopefully i don t get bad karma for my accidental theft!
i hope not too!
i attended a ball recently _comma_  one of the girls had the most stunning dress . 
a ball _comma_  how fancy! was the girl as stunning as her dress?
no way _comma_  her dress looked like little diamonds had been stitched on every inch of her dress .  not many girls can compete with that .  diamonds are forever . 
yeah _comma_  i  can see a dress like that can easily outshine any girl .  the dress sounds amazing though . 
i had to schedule an appointment with the dentist after not visiting one in five years . 
that is crazy .  did you not have insurance for all these years you missed the dentist appointments?
i do not have insurance .  i went anyway because i had a problem with one tooth . 
i hope the problem was not deep in the enamel of the tooth since that requires a lot of work . 
the internet has been there through thick and thin for me
the internet is a great thing .  i don t know what we d do without it . 
true _comma_  it s a great resource to have
we had an issue with our internet for a couple of days and it was so inconvenient!
seeing animals sleep is very relaxing
i ve never felt that way myself .  what do you find relaxing about watching animals sleep?
i don t know _comma_  i guess i m just tired
i suppose when you feel tired _comma_  anything can feel relaxing
my dog got hit by a car . 
really? i m so sorry to hear that
yeah .  he didn t survive .  i really miss him
hope everything gets better soon
i remember not having any responsibilities as a kid
me too _comma_  i really miss those days . 
yea _comma_  those were the days
if only time machines were real . 
i found an old photo album of my family .  it really brought back memories . 
it s good to remember days gone by
it s kind of a bittersweet experience
yea _comma_  like you can remember those times but things are different
i had a tough semester but i just saw my grades and i m pleased with the results . 
taht is always a weight off the shoulders _comma_  i m glad you are pleased . 
yeah _comma_  it was a huge relief for me .  i am so glad to be done with this semester . 
i remember that feeling  _comma_   finals week is so stressful  _comma_   then there is that wave of relief . 
i should not have been so quick to let my teen take the car _comma_  but she was so excited . 
did her drive turn out alright?
well  _comma_   let me just say that the pole made it out alright  _comma_  lol . 
oh no! is your daughter okay?
she is _comma_  and now my car has a very crude imitation of a red racing stripe down the side!
after a gym workout i m always ready to get back and hit a new pr
that s great! what motivates you?
i think just knowing that one day i ll be able to do things that are unimaginable right now _comma_  and i know i can do better the next time
wow that s so motivating _comma_  thanks for that i really needed to hear that
my stomach made a loud noise while i was in class taking a test
oh that s weird what did you do?
i just pretended like nothing happened _comma_  but i m worried everyone thinks it was something other than my stomach
no no _comma_  dont
i felt pretty good leaving the gym today _comma_  hit a new pr on overhead press
that s great .  you must have been working really hard . 
i like to try my hardest!
and it has paid off .  good for you . 
i felt like i could do anything after i finished meditating
nice! how long do you meditate for?
i try to go longer everyday _comma_  i was able to go    minutes yesterday
dang! well i hope you have a stress free weekend and be full of energy!
i caught my boyfriend texting his ex
wow .  dump him and beat him up!
i think he will dump me soon .  he would rather be with her _comma_  i just know it
that is unfortunate _comma_  he is a scumbag .  i hope you find yourself a nice and wealthy boyfriend!
my friend has been working with me on the weekends to get my tennis game on the next level . 
tennis _comma_  how fun! have you noticed improvement?
yeah i can consistently serve with power and accuracy now .  i feel almost decent now . 
that s magnificent! i ve never played tennis myself _comma_  but it s a sport i ve always enjoyed watching . 
a while back i caught my partner at the time being dishonest to me . 
that is to bad _comma_  is it someone you have been with a long time?
we were together for a year and a half and we had a child together shortly before i found out!
wow _comma_  that is really messed up .  did you end up leaving them?
high school was a great time _comma_  but those days are long gone
also nostalgic ey? i get you    _comma_     those easy days    _comma_     no stress    _comma_     no limits    _comma_     anything is possible 
no bills to pay  _comma_   going out to eat with friends all the time  _comma_   pretty fun
i wish we could go back to those days .  
around   months ago _comma_  i had major surgery that caused me to be immobile for a few weeks . 
i m so sorry you had to go through that! what happened?
well  _comma_   i had lots of support from my family  _comma_   but i felt afraid of getting back into the swing of things for fear of failing .  i felt so vulnerable . 
i m sure it was a very difficult experience .  you must be a really strong person to have gotten through that . 
i love going to the gym because i feel stronger
nice! how long do you go to the gym for?
probably half a year  _comma_   been the most consistent in my life  _comma_   how about you?
i never even leave the house! i am the opposite of you!
it s tough to talk to my parents _comma_  but i try to talk about things we don t disagree on
that is unfortunate _comma_  what do you usually avoid talking about?
anything political or religious really _comma_  or relationships
well i hope one day your parents are more accepting!
i had my dog for    years before she passed away last year from cancer .  it was devastating!
oh no i am so sorry to hear that .  are you planning on getting  a new dog? 
probably not for a while .  she was a great companion _comma_  but i don t think my heart is ready to bring in a new dog quite yet . 
aww _comma_  yeah i know what you mean .  dogs are so lovable .  i also have a new pup myself .  i got him a couple years ago
i was horribly wronged by someone i thought i could trust .  the feeling was devastating _comma_  and i ve always struggled with forgiveness . 
oh my  _comma_   what happened? i m so sorry  _comma_   no one should treat anyone they care about poorly . 
they were dishonest and physically cruel .  we have gone our separate ways _comma_  but i truly hope they can learn to treat others better . 
i m sorry hun _comma_  you deserve to be treated better than that .  i hope you know that . 
last month i came home from work and noticed my cat wasn t feeling well _comma_  so i rushed her to the vet .  i had to put her down . 
i m so sorry _comma_  that is the worst feelings .  i had to put my dog down as well .  i know you did the right thing . 
i know _comma_  i just really miss her .  poor cancer kitty .  i loved her so much . 
cats are really some of the greatest companions .  how old did she live?
my roommate got a new cat last week _comma_  and we finally let them meet today .  i was so nervous and worried about it . 
how did it go?
it went okay .  my cat bopped him a little and growled a lot but no real swipes .  so better than expected i guess . 
that s good some things just take time
when i was pregnant with my first born _comma_  it was considered a high risk pregnancy .  it made me very worried and anxious throughout . 
i can imagine .  how did things turn out?
i had to have emergency surgery in the end _comma_  but being able to hold my healthy baby was the greatest blessing i could have asked for . 
i m so glad you made it through
i m so happy summer classes are officially over and i ll be able to relax for a week!
great what will you be doing during your time off ? 
i m not even sure what to do with all this time! i guess i should relax or have some leisure time _comma_  but everything in me says to try and be productive even on break .  it s that school mentality . 
i agree with you _comma_ you ll feel good about yourself being productive !
my sister came to visit from out of state .  it was the first time we ve seen her in nearly a decade!
that must have been exciting to see her after so long .  does she live very far away?
yes she lives on the other side of the country .  we had a nice dinner _comma_  but my boyfriend is a loud chewer and a sloppy eater .  it was quite embarrassing!
that s a shame .  does your sister have a bad impression of your boyfriend after having dinner with you?
i just bought a new dress and i can t wait to wear it this weekend . 
i love buying new clothes! where do you think you ll wear it to?
i m going to wear it to a party .  everyone will have their eyes on me!
how exciting! i bet you ll look flawless!
a few months ago i could barely walk up a flight of stairs without having to catch my breath _comma_  but i bit the bullet and have been training . 
how has that been going for you?
wonderful! it s definitely hard work  _comma_   but i continue on  _comma_   even on the days i don t want to .  today i discovered i can now comfortably run an uphill mile and i feel very confident!
that s amazing!
my boss told me about a potential job opportunity and i ve been waiting to hear if it s going to happen
nervous?
a little bit .  i am mostly excited about it though
that s good! excitement and nervousness are both the same  _comma_   so it s very hard to tell  _comma_   but it s amazing you are able to convert all the bad feelings into positive ones! good luck 
i was very prepared for my final exam .  it was so easy . 
that s a great feeling .  going in knowing you ll do well _comma_  and then actually doing well . 
if i m being honest   _comma_    i made an answer key from the quizzes we took this semester .  as they say   _comma_    work smart   _comma_    not hard . 
ingenuity like that will reward you in the real world .  academia is a system  _comma_   and if you game it  _comma_   you ve won .   
my cousin was swinging recklessly on my hammock and ended up breaking it!
oh no! i would be very furuios!
i was very upset _comma_  especially considering how long it took me to get it set up .  i loved laying in my peaceful hammock to read . 
i would be devastated! maybe he wont do it agian . 
i received a phone call the other day from a friend i hadn t heard from in ages . 
oh wow _comma_  i bet that was nice .  hopefully y all had a good talk . 
we reminisced about old times .  it was very nice  _comma_   indeed .  it was nice hearing from him  _comma_   especially during some rough times!
well _comma_  that is fantastic .  hopefully y all will be able to meet up in the future real soon too .  
i have a weekend of nothing but relaxation planned for this weekend . 
that sounds amazing .  how are you planning to relax?
i have some leftover roast in the fridge so i don t even have to leave the house .  i m going to watch a lot of netflix and maybe do a little laundry . 
that sounds very relaxing .  don t forget the snacks for netflix!
i keep having these dreams that i am out in public and somehow my clothes disappear .  it s awful .  
that could possibly indicate that you are a free creature! and you don t like to be caged! don t worry about it the dream _comma_  as they are only metaphorical
i hate those dreams _comma_  i feel anything but free .  they re really uncomfortable and make me nothing but a ball of negative emotions like anxiety as i spend the majority of the dream trying to find clothes and get away from people .  
don t worry _comma_  you re wearing clothes now aren t you? :)
one of my friends recently bought a house .  i really wish i could afford a house . 
wow that is great for your friend! and don t stress it _comma_  we are still young and have plenty of time to save up for a house!
i m starting to feel like i will never be able to afford a house .  they re just so expensive .  and the market has been going up here about  % a year for the past    years . 
wow that is crazy  _comma_   i know how you feel  _comma_   the best solution is to probably find a cheap place to rent out until it is possible to buy one .  
i ended up staying at home for the holidays
why is that? comfort ?
no all my family lives out of state .  i didn t feel like traveling _comma_  but i just ended up sitting at home and watching lord of the rings in the dark . 
oh nice! that s sounds so amazing  _comma_   i love watching lord of the rings every now and then  _comma_   did you watch all the sequels all over again?
i bumped into a friend from middle school .  we chatted for a while
wow _comma_  that must have been nice to catch up .  when was the last time you saw your friend?
before  th grade .  i moved away that summer .  seeing her brought back a lot of good memories
seeing old friends that you have not contacted in so long is a nice feeling .  
i had a doctors appointment at   am and they kept me waiting for almost   hours . 
really!? that is very unprofessional of them to make you wait for so long . 
it was terrible i ended being late for work because of their horrible service . 
that is frustrating .  you should complain to them . 
the past few months have been terribly rough _comma_  but i think i can say that they have made me stronger . 
oh no  _comma_   i am sorry that you have been having a rough time  _comma_   but i am glad to hear that you have grown from your experiances . 
thank you .  i hope that i can move forward and at least learn from these hardships . 
yeah i believe that you will be able to _comma_  but never forget you are not alone! i am always here if you need some moral support :)
i really hate when people can t hold themselves accountable for their own actions and decisions . 
i agree .  so often does pride get in the way of personal growth and reflection . 
absolutely .  yet  _comma_   these people have a horrible way of twisting things in order to guilt you  _comma_   even if you d done nothing wrong! it s a very manipulating and confusing feeling . 
you d hope folks would grow up  _comma_   but sometimes people get set in their ways  _comma_   and become impossible to change . 
i received a very odd message today .  it came from a person who i blocked online _comma_  but they managed to find a loophole and messaged me by way of an inactive group . 
oh no _comma_  what did they say? 
they were just trying to find ways to contact me .  i have literally blocked them on all social media .  it seems borderline stalkish _comma_  and it makes me very anxious . 
that is really creepy  _comma_   i would feel anxious too .  i think you should report the to the police if you notice any strange or threatening messages  _comma_  feel free to also call me if you need anything! :)
i m going rock climbing with some friends!
that sounds fun and scary! you must be pretty fit to take on that challenge . 
i have done some climbing indoors for practice  _comma_   but never done a big climb out doors  _comma_   so who know how it will go . 
i m sure that there will be some differences _comma_  but i m sure you will nail it! just remember to be safe!
i keep having these really weird nightmares at night . 
oh my _comma_  what are they about?
i m usually in a big city that i m familiar with   _comma_    and roam around in the dream until i get stalked   _comma_    jumped   _comma_    and sometimes very hurt . 
wow sounds like some inception plot line _comma_  you need to learn how to control the dream
today i was quite impressed with my endurance during my work out .  a few months ago _comma_  i couldn t even walk up a flight of stairs without losing my breath . 
sound like you re making a lot of progress!
i sure have  _comma_   but it s such hard work .  i make sure to work out  _comma_   even on the days that i don t want to .  it s definitely taken a lot of will power . 
that s great! all the hard work is paying off . 
i had a high risk pregnancy up until a few months ago .  i felt the most grateful i d ever been when my baby turned out healthy . 
congrats _comma_  that must have been a very stressful time leading up the the birth . 
it was a really rough pregnancy that ended with a very painful surgery .  it was not pretty _comma_  but definitely worth it .  i would have taken any amount of pain as long as my son was born healthy and safe . 
you sound like a great mother .  i m sure your son is very lucky to have you . 
i just learned my first trick in ice skating _comma_  a triple spin twirl kick front flip . 
wow that sounds challenging! you must have some serious strength to pull that off!
i never thought i would have the balance to perform such a feat .  i think i can no qualify for the olympics .  
you should definitely try! it would be tough  _comma_   but if you have the determination  _comma_   it would be so worth it . 
i just started college again  _comma_   and while i m doing great in school  _comma_   it has lead me to feel very lonely with a lack of social life . 
oh no! you should try to make some more friends with your classmates . 
that sound like a good idea if they weren t online classes .  next semester i have a few on campus courses _comma_  so i m hoping i ll be able to make at least one new friend . 
i hope you re able to find some friends in the next semester then!
this upcoming semester will be my first time taking   classes at once .  i m pretty worried that i may have taken on too much . 
yeah that sounds hectic .  you think you can do it?
i m not sure .  the more i think about it  _comma_   the more i doubt myself .  i also have a baby  _comma_   so i m hoping i ll be able to juggle everything at once . 
yeah sounds like a handful! maybe you should weigh your options and do whats best for you adn your family .  
i adore my girlfriend .  i am getting very serious about not leaving her side . 
that is great to here!
thank you .  do you have a romantic interest?
not at the moment .  i m too focused on bettering myself . 
summer in the south calls for many unwanted visitors of the insect type!
i m from the south too! are you talking about mosquitoes by any chance?
mosquitoes _comma_  and those dreadful flying ants .  they re everywhere!
one day we ll find a way to repay them all the misery they ve caused us . 
lately i ve felt proud of my success as a newly single mother .  it gets lonely sometimes _comma_  but i can honestly say i ve been doing everything i can and more . 
keep up the good work! you will do good in life and be a good role model for your kids .  
thank you! i definitely have a drive to feel strong for them .  i hope some day they can realize my efforts . 
they will notice how caring you are! dont ever cut yourself short!
i have a plethora of amazing friends .  one of mine recently drove me from georgia to south florida
that does sound like a good friend .  how long of a drive is that?
it is an   hour drive! florida is a very long state
you re lucky to have such a good friend!
i recently totaled my car .  there were no injuries but i feel absolutely terrible
oh no! i ve been there .  how did it happen?
it was very wet and i took a turn at too high of a speed . 
i m glad your safe! those roads can be dangerous . 
my mom and i haven t always had the best relationship .  recently i ve had to tell myself to let her in more .  it s been challenging . 
i hope that your relationship continues to strengthen . 
thank you .  i know that  _comma_   even though it s challenging  _comma_   i need to be patient in order to improve our relationship . 
i agree .  life is short and having these relationships is very important
i have had the toughest time getting my pet rat to get along with others .  she s always been very aggressive!
oh no! i hope it dont bite anyone .  that can be nervwrecking . 
she s never bitten anyone   _comma_    thankfully   _comma_    but she gets crazy with other rats .  to my surprise though   _comma_    i ve recently found her snuggling with the others she usually tries to fight!
im glad it worked out well .  i bet your finally content with her being around other rats .  
this past month _comma_  i was able to visit six flags!
that s neat and sounds like a lot of fun!
it was amazing .  the last time i was at an amusement park had to have been over a decade ago!
i have not been in years! was it as fun this time as it was years ago?
the other day i noticed my pet has a growth on her lower belly .  i fear it may be a tumor . 
what kind of pet is it? hope your animal is okay!
she s a rat _comma_  so her body is very frail .  i m sad that she likely will not make it .  she s been with me through thick and thin . 
i heard rats make awesome pets _comma_  i m so sorry! is your rat in pain?
i let the girl of my dreams slip away .  now i am alone . 
i m sure with the help and support he will be alright . 
i hope so .  i think that time heals all wounds . 
definitely  _comma_   i think so too  _comma_   time and right care . 
i recently went to the pool and lost my suit .  my trunks were in the water without me!
oh my! i hope you were the only one there! otherwise that would have been scary!
i was not _comma_  unfortunately .  people saw everything!
oh my god! how embarrassing! looksl like you will stay inside for awhile . 
i let a romantic interest slip through my fingers .  she s now with somebody that i despise
wow _comma_  that s so sad .  hopefully a new love will come to you!
i think so .  i have plenty of time and life goes
sure _comma_  it s never too late .  and you never know what s gonna happen soon . 
i feel great right now .  i have a new album coming out and it feels liberating to be done!
very nice! i bet your very proud of it and are excited for what may come from it . 
i am very excited .  it is almost an hour and a half long
i bet you worked very hard on it! it will be great!
i can t wait to travel .  i am going to madagascar soon!
wow! that sounds exciting! have you traveled around the world a lot?
i have! i actually grew up in saudi arabia
traveling is the best way to learn about other cultures .  you are very fortunate to get the opportunity .  
the world is savage .  i believe that the right individuals can take us to a better place in the future
i agree _comma_  we need more moral people to guide us . 
i think so too .  there are some kind and great people in the world
let s hope they find their way to the top soon for our sake . 
i went walking in the woods one night .  it was pretty scary out there
did anything happen?
no  _comma_   everything was fine  _comma_   but it was a chilling experience
oh _comma_  i m sure .  at least everything ended up alright though . 
i caught my dog trying to eat my nephew s dirty diaper that my brother left on the couch
oh man _comma_  that s funny and terrible at the same time . 
it was really gross .  i had to keep my dog from licking my face for a long time after that . 
yeah _comma_  i would keep away from him for another   months or so . 
i recently remembered a sweet memory of my aunt who recently passed away . 
what was it?
she would give hundreds of dollars of school supplies to kids in need each year . 
wow _comma_  that s an amazing woman .  did she rub off on you any?
she did! i fill stockings around the holidays and go around on christmas giving them out to people who have to work .  :)
that s pretty cool of you .  i hope to have a daughter like you someday
my daughter and her family are coming this thanksgiving .  i m already preparing for their visit . 
oh that s exciting! are you nervous at all?
not too much  _comma_   just really exciting .  i m planning everything even though it s months away  _comma_   even the menu . 
oh wow _comma_  it sounds like you really love them .  i m super happy for you! i hope it goes exactly how you planned .  you sound like a good father . 
my mother in law was recently placed in hospice and is not expected to live much longer . 
oh man .  it s always tough to lose a parent .  how old is she?
she s      _comma_    so she has lived a long life   _comma_    but she has alzheimers   _comma_    and it s really sad to watch her lose her mind . 
yeah i bet .  at least you got to know her for as long as you did
that s a great way of looking at it .  i should try to keep a positive attitude towards it . 
yep she s want you to remember that _comma_  even if she can t remember it herself
i was driving home from out of town really late one night and was exhausted
that s very dangerous  _comma_  driving and being exhausted did you manage to get home safe?
i did get home safe but it was scary because the roads were two lane and lots of    wheelers were heading in the opposite direction .  i kept thinking i would swerve into their lane and collide into them
i m glad you didn t 
i ve been trying to be extra supportive towards my husband .  
that s nice to hear .   it s always a good thing in a marriage to show each other support through thick and thin . 
yes   so true .  his mom is dying _comma_  and he is working long hours on top of it .  i feel really bad for him . 
i m sorry to hear that .   just knowing that he has you to lean on probably goes a very long way in helping him get through that . 
my friend who i haven t seen in a long time came to visit .  she married a very wealthy man and i was a bit envious
oh no! were you envious because you liked her yourself _comma_  or because you don t have a wealthy husband?
she drove up in a fancy car and seems like she doesn t have a care in the world .  i wish that were me some days . 
it can be you _comma_  you just have to work hard for it . 
i was at a get together recently and a friend s husband was flirting with me . 
i feel bad for your friend .  did you tell her?
i didn t know what to say to her _comma_  and was afraid she wouldn t believe me and it would cause her to be angry at me .  it s a bad situation .  
oh god _comma_  that sounds terrible
when i was in second grade _comma_  i wet my pants in the middle of class . 
oh that s so embaressing 
i know! i was super afraid of my teacher _comma_  and was scared to ask her to go to the bathroom . 
why are were you scared? don t be next time stand up and ask your teacher you want to go to the toilet otherwise you will wet your pants
she was really mean and always yelling! i didn t want her to yell at me .  i m much older and wiser now!
i want to trick my butler into thinking he won the lottery .  i ve taped the local new s winning lottery numbers and i m going to buy a ticket with the same numbers and give it to my butler
that s hilarious! is he usually down for a good prank?
i m not sure he likes being the target of pranks _comma_  but he likes to prank me and this prank is to get back at him for a prank he pulled on me and my cousin
well   _comma_    that s fair .  if he pulls them   _comma_    he has to be willing to have them pulled on him   _comma_    too . 
my friend just took her kids to disneyland and i feel a little bad about it . 
why s that?
i d been wanting to do that trip with my kids for years .  i m happy for her  just wish it could have been me . 
i can understand that .  it s a tough trip to make _comma_  but hopefully you ll be able to soon . 
i won a trip to washington d . c .  a few years ago
and how was it? did you enjoy it?
i had a blast .  i met people from all over the country  _comma_   visited many historical sites  _comma_   and learned a lot about how government works 
and how was it? did you enjoy it?
i m looking forward to my best friend s surprise birthday party next week!
that sounds like so much fun! i love parties!
i m really happy about it  she s a great friend and she s turning    _comma_  so it s a big one!
hey _comma_  i just had that one! what do you have planned?
about    friends _comma_  surprising her at her favorite bar after work .  
my   th high school reunion is coming up and i m excited . 
that sounds like fun! are you looking forward to seeing anyone in particular?
honestly? there was this girl who really treated me poorly   i can t wait for her to see how successful i have been!
well i hope she s there .  maybe she ll regret how she treated you . 
a hurricane hit my city .  the first night i thought the wind was going to tear the roof off the house 
oh no! hurricanes are scary .   i ve been through a few myself .   was it your first one?
it was my third .  luckily we didn t lose power for more than a few hours
i lost power in our last hurricane for   days .   did the wind do any damage to your home?
it damaged the roof and the fence .  we lost power for six days during the first hurricane i experienced
in the end _comma_  i d rather be  in a hurricane than a snow storm .   lol
i am loyal to my principles  _comma_   that is why i do not eat meat  _comma_   because i love life 
wow _comma_   you are a vegetarian? 
if i already have    years of vegetarian
this is serious .   for me _comma_   i don t joke with meat
i healthy physically and spiritually
my daughter recently broke curfew by three hours!
that must ve made you so furious
i was super angry _comma_  yes! i ended up grounding her for three weeks  one week for each hour she was late . 
you sure are a very strict parent . 
i have a certification exam coming up and i think i ll do well . 
that s great! i m sure you ll be well prepared .  
i think so  i ve studied quite a bit with my husband and others . 
then i am sure it will go well for you .  what is it in?

wow _comma_   what happened to her eyes? 
they are sick
ohhh sorry about that .  it is well .

my new manager gave me a pay rise!
that s got to be an amazing feeling to have going for you .  how do you feel?
i feel very grateful that he has been so generous . 
it s going to help your family out so much i bet everyone is so proud of you _comma_  congrats you deserve it . 
my partner left me the other day . 
that s rough _comma_  i m sorry to hear that
that s fine _comma_  its not your problem .  i just feel very lonely right now . 
i am sure you will find someone who will love you even more than your ex did soon . 
i just moved to a new city and i don t know anyone
that s too bad _comma_  you have to go out and make new friends . 
yeah _comma_  it s hard though .  i hate to go out by myself .  it s hard for me to meet new people
suck it up and get out there _comma_  it is the only way or you will end up very lonely . 
i took my final exams a few weeks ago and i was sure i had done well _comma_  but i failed . 
oh i m so sorry to hear that!
i don t know what happened .  i studied and passed everything else .  now i have to retake the class and i m upset
is there somewhere you can go for extra help with that course? a tutor or something?
my sister kept playing a few seconds of a song over and over again on her laptop last night .  now it s stuck in my head . 
that s so annoying .   i hate it when that happens . 
it drives me bonkers when she does that
can you block her out _comma_  maybe?  get some noise blocking headphones?
i saw these   color bic pens in the store the other day .  i remember when i was young and getting one was like christmas morning!
the ones with the little colored sliders on the end? those were cool!
yes! my mom used to always get me one each year before school started .  those were the coolest pens in the world!
i liked them too . 
i m optimistic that my house is going to sell soon . 
has it been on the market for long?
only a week  and    people have seen it already _comma_  so i m feeling good about it selling quickly!
wow! that s awesome .  i m sure you ll sell soon . 
my best friend was going to travel from wisconsin to see my this summer _comma_  but she ended up not being able to come . 
oh that s too bad _comma_  what did you end up doing
nothing  i still haven t seen her .  i felt pretty let down   but hopefully i can make the trip to see her soon . 
you should defently and don t let this affect you too much _comma_  maybe she has a good reason
my sister threw up the other day and made a huge mess . 
that must have been an explosion and a half _comma_  did  you clean it up?
fortunately no  she cleaned it up .  but she had just had spaghetti and it was floating in it .  it was so gross!
i can imagine _comma_  that s gross as hell
i was livid when i went to work the other day and saw my car was broken in to
oh no! that s terrible! i ve had that happen before and it sucks
i heard it was happening in other areas but didn t expect it here because we live in a nice neighborhood .  so frustrating
i can imagine .  did they steal anything?
every year when the kids go back to school _comma_  it brings back so many memories of when my kids were going to school . 
i know what you mean .   i love to see all the pictures _comma_  and think back to how little mine used to be . 
i would cry the first day of school every year _comma_  especially the milestone years .  now my grandchildren are starting school .  time flies by too quickly
they do seem to be grown before you know it .   make you wonder how if goes so fast!
so everyone is gone form the house and i found a thing of thin mints _comma_  and i ate the whole thing for breakfast . 
sometimes it s ok to indulge .  did it give you a stomachache though lol?
lol _comma_  i swear it was like i sat down and they were gone!  probably gave myself diabetes .  so not going to be able to eat the rest of the day!
you should follow up with a few veggies later on maybe to balance it out .  i know that feeling though .  its just so good you can t eat just one lol
sigh  _comma_   i have no self control  _comma_   definatley need a veggie or two today now! probably should knix those form the pantry
my father passed away in november _comma_  it s made me feel empty ever since . 
i m so sorry for your loss! it s so hard to lose a parent . 
i didn t think it would hit me hard .  i felt like i was prepared .  
sadly _comma_  i don t think we can ever be prepared for that kind of loss . 
i surprised my girlfriend with chik fil a breakfast this morning when she got off work . 
wow _comma_   that s so nice of you
she works nights _comma_  and had no idea i was coming .  i knew she had a bad night so i wanted to do something nice for her . 
that is cool .   you are really so caring 
i recently was laid off from my job .  i haven t found anything yet _comma_  but i m trying to stay positive that i will soon . 
oh darn _comma_  that sucks .   keeping a positive attitude is the way to go! i m sure something is out there for you . 
i keep looking and applying _comma_  but still here i sit .  i know it will happen when the right one comes along though
and here the job market was supposed to get great again .   lol
i lost the book that my friend let me borrow .  i feel so embarrassed . 
oh no! can you replace it?
i m trying to find a new one _comma_  but this one was rare and hard to find .  
i m sure your friend will be understanding that it was a mistake . 
my birthday was last week and i never heard from my brother or my sister to wish me a happy birthday . 
oh no i am sorry to hear that! they must have been really busy and it must have slipped their mind
i guess i shouldn t expect so much from them and let myself get let down like i have . 
i am sure they had their reasons _comma_  maybe you should give them a call and see if everything is alright .  they may be going through their own problems right now .  
the older i get _comma_  the more relaxed and just a simple happy and calm feeling i have .  it is nice to just enjoy being alive . 
i agree .  the sound of birdsong   _comma_    a gentle breeze on a summer s day   _comma_    the purring of your tabby cat .  you can t beat that   _comma_    can you?
those examples are definitely the simple pleasures of life .  it makes me want to go outside and listen to the birds and smell the flowers . 
you should! forget about your worries _comma_  if only for a moment .  you ll return feeling refreshed . 
i went swimming the other day and when i jump into the water and came back up _comma_  my bathing suit top was pulled over my breast and i was wandering why everyone was staring at me . 
yikes _comma_  that s not a fun situation .  did you figure it out pretty quickly?
yes i did realize fairly fast why everyone was staring .  i looked down and seen my breast exposed .  
that s good _comma_  i d be mortified if that happened to me . 
i think my cat likes my new girlfriend more than he likes me now . 
i ve had that happen before .  my cat is definitely more my wife s cat now .  does he still cuddle up with you?
yea he loves to sit on my lap while i work _comma_  but prefers her side of the bed now when he sleeps .  
haha  _comma_   same for me .  it s like as soon as my wife is available to sit or lay with  _comma_   i m chopped liver . 
my grandfather passed away not too long ago _comma_  i received a bunch of items he left for me .  
i m sorry for your loss _comma_  i bet you two were close .  what did he leave you?
some interesting antiques  _comma_   grandfather clocks  _comma_   and a lot of items related to his work for the house of representatives .  interesting stuff
oh he worked for congress? that s very interesting .  that sounds like an awesome haul of vintage stuff . 
i had to let my dad borrow my car the other day .  his truck is in the shop . 
that was kind of you! has his truck been repaired?
yeah it has .  and  _comma_   he took good care of my car  _comma_   as always . 
of course! your dad is very trustworthy . 
i ca not believe what happened the other night at my friends house _comma_  i ll never show my face again . 
can you please give a little more detail about what happened at your friends house that made you not want to show your face??
sure    _comma_     i fell asleep on the chair and had a dream    _comma_     in my dream i went to the restroom    _comma_     so yeah    _comma_     i peed right there in their chair . 
how embarrassing! i did that one time when i was sleeping in my bed and i thought i got up and went to the bathroom to pee  _comma_   but i did not go to the bathroom  _comma_   i peed my pants in the bed .  
yes  _comma_   it was not fun  _comma_   but good to know i am not the only one . 
i enjoy helping the wildlife in my area where i live .  i give them a helping hand .  i give them water  _comma_   birdseed  _comma_   my left over food .  the animals love watermelon and cantaloupe .  
that is so cool  _comma_   my mother in law has bears come into her yard! i d be happy with the hummingbirds  _comma_   so pretty . 
i just have the small non dangerous type of wildlife that i like to help birds  _comma_   rabbits  _comma_   squirrels and such .  no big bad bears! 
the squirrels keep stealing the feed in my birdfeeder _comma_  they do trapeze to get to it . 
we got a new puppy! we took him in from our father in law . 
that s amazing! we just got a new puppy this last weekend also! what kind is yours?
its a long hair chihuahua and a short hair chihuahua .  he has the most adorable under bite!
aw that is super cute! dogs bring such happiness to a home . 
i found out my wife was having an affair _comma_  the worst part is i knew the guy and welcomed him in my home and was kind to him . 
oh man _comma_  i m really sorry you have to go through that .  betrayal like that is so painful .  how are you doing?
i m learning to live my live without her _comma_  it s tough .  some honesty would have made the way it ended much better .  thanks for the kind words . 
of course _comma_  no one deserves to have their heartbroken like that .  i hope you find someone who treats you with the respect and kindness you deserve . 
i went on a soda fast for two days so that i could pray for strength for my husband while he tried to quit smoking .  i am addicted to soda so it was hard .  i made it though and i was able to pray for him multiple times during the two days . 
sugar is very addicting! i m glad you could make it
yeah me too .  the lack of caffeine made me get a bad headache that took three days to get rid of . 
caffeine headaches are no joke . 
no _comma_  they suck!!
i recently had an argument with a friend .  even though i talked ot her about it and let her know how i felt  _comma_   my daughter overheard me discussing it with my husband .  she thought i was being two faced  _comma_   which lead to a long discussion .  i felt guilty even though i didn t do anything wrong . 
sounds like you were just misunderstood .  i discuss things with my husband  _comma_   too  _comma_   and it s not like talking behind someone s back .  that s what married couples do .  don t feel bad .  
yeah  _comma_   i just felt like i set a bad example for my daughter  _comma_   even thought she misunderstood .  i guess it was a teachable moment though . 
yes _comma_  just tell her your home is a safe place to talk .  it s okay to open up in the family .  
that s good advice .  thanks!
i found huge box full of my old cd s recently  _comma_   found a ton of old pc games i used to play  _comma_   reminded me of a simpler time!
awesome! did you play any of them after you found the box?
i did  _comma_   i played a few sessions of age of empires and i plan to play some command and conquer red alert tonight before bed  _comma_   still great games . 
neat! i haven t played them .  even though everything is becoming digital _comma_  i find there is something special about the physical copies!
i got turned down for a job i really wanted . 
ugh  _comma_   sorry! you must be disappointed .  but remember if the door doesn t open  _comma_   it probably wasn t yours .  there s something else in store for you!
thanks .   but yes _comma_  i was really dejected .   i thought i d interviewed well and had a good enough resume . 
sometimes they already have a candidate in mind but have to go through the motion . the same thing happened to my husband .  your time will come . 
when my wife left me  _comma_   i felt worthless and like giving up on life to be honest  _comma_   i ve since started making some positive changes and and more optimistic 
i can t even imagine how devastating that would be .  i think you must be really strong to be able to move forward . 
well  _comma_   like the saying goes  _comma_   get busy living or get busy dying .  i m not sure if i ll ever find someone i truly love but life goes on!
you might  _comma_   but i believe you can have a full life as a single person  _comma_   too . 
i bought a    foot boat .  i believe it will be able to handle the large lake that i will be taking it on . 
wow! a    foot boat _comma_  that must be amazing to take out on the lake! how much did it cost you?
it cost me around      _comma_      .  it has all the latest features  _comma_   that should keep me safe in all but the most extreme conditions .  
id love to own a boat _comma_  are you using it for leisure or fishing etc? 
it has been a dream of mine for a long time .  i am mainly going to use it for fishing .  but might have to take my wife tubing to make her happy .  
they both sound like great plans! tubing would be a great way to keep her happy while you fish haha!
we should have a lot of fun this summer with it! makes up for all the hard work saving up for it .  
i hope you do! it makes you feel like you ve actually earned it!
i like like loaning money to friends .  it can ruin friendships and sometimes doesn t get paid back . 
i m always leery of loaning money to friends
yeah  _comma_   i meant don t like  _comma_   sorry .  i recently lent some to my friend with no expectation of getting it back because of her hard situation .  i actually got it back . 
that was a nice surprise!  i have tried lending money to friends but finally had to stop after never getting it back
last summer _comma_  my dog went missing .  we looked for him everywhere and called all of our neighbors .  no one had seen him . 
oh no! how sad! did you ever find him?
after a week of looking for him and checking the shelters _comma_  a neighbor found his body under her house .  he had gotten under there and couldn t find a way out .  i was so heart broken and so were my daughters . 
oh _comma_  how awful! i m so sorry!
i try to skateboard with my kids everyday .  they love it _comma_  and it makes me feel young again . 
wow _comma_  very cool .  the last time i tried to skateboard i almost broke my tailbone .  props to you though!
it can be scary some times _comma_  but its worth it . 
is it though? haha .  if you can do it without falling down then you are doing better than me .  probably a good bonding experience i d imagine .  
my daughters  th birthday was recently  _comma_   unfortunately her mothers side of the family didn t show up  _comma_   even though they all rsvp d
too bad for them! my sons  th birthday was just last week _comma_  and we had a fun party .  there so much easier to please when their little lol . 
hah yea _comma_  she was sad at first but there was plenty of presents and people who love her around to distract her .  they grow up fast .  
they do .  i can t believe how fast the time goes . 
the other week _comma_  a friend of mine told me there was an opening where he worked and to get him a resume .  i took to long to get my resume together and they gave the job to someone else . 
that must have been aggravating! job hunting is so hard . 
it would have been nice .  less pay  _comma_   but i would have had to work less .  oh well  _comma_   guess i ll try harder next time . 
maybe something better will come along!
the other day i was running late .  so _comma_  i jumped up and threw on some clothes then ran out of the house . 
well i hope you got there in time and nothing bad happened . 
i did but when after i was out for a while i noticed the shirt i was wearing was covered in grease stains .  i apparently washed it with my husbands work clothes . 
oh know! i hope you weren t heading to a job interview _comma_  haha . 
i have ms _comma_  and sometimes i have bowl problems . 
i m so sorry .  have you tried any natural remedies?
no _comma_  i ve tried science remedies .  i like those kinds better . 
i hope you find something that gives you some relief!
my son got a remote control car for his birthday .  its really cool . 
that s awesome .  did you get him it? i bet he loves it . 
no   _comma_    his grandpa did .  but   _comma_    after he went to bed   _comma_    i went outside and played with it for a while . 
haha i would ve done the same .  those toys always make me lose myself .  they re so much fun!
someone broke into my car the other day _comma_  but they didnt steal anything . 
wow you were lucky! it has happened to me before too .  it feels so violating . 
i know! i feel both violated and kind of sad because i have nothing in my car worth stealing . 
because you were not in it .  :)
there was an elderly lady at my church who was blind and could not hear well so you had to talk really loud for her to hear you .  she was very faithful about coming to church so our preacher picked her up and took her home for every service .  when she needed help _comma_  we took turns helping her .  
that is so nice of you all! i know she appreciates it . 
when i saw that she needed help _comma_  i always tried to give her directions based on where she was with her walker .  i liked helping her .  she recently passed away and i miss her . 
aww _comma_  i m so sorry but know you made a difference in her life . 
yes  _comma_   she loved everyone she met .  she would say she couldn t remember everyone s names  _comma_   but she loved them anyway . 
i took my son to kindergarten the other day .  he loves it so far!
that is good! did he make any friends?
you bet! he made a girlfriend on the bus by talking about zelda . 
that is really cute!
lately  _comma_   my family and i have been very blessed .  we are all happy and healthy .  all of our major bills have already been paid for the month  _comma_   and we have been going to a three week long revival at a local church . 
that s awesome! whats your secret to success?
we have just been trusting in the lord . 
well he seems to be guiding you in the right direction .  i hope your blessings continue!
thank you . 
i was looking at some old pictures of my kids  first day of school from   years ago . 
first day of school i remember   _comma_  my kids first day of school  _comma_   how did it make you feel?
it just gave me the feeling that time flies by too quickly sometimes .   my youngest in the pic was in first grade and his older sister was in  th grade . 
yes it does but we always got or memories . 
and tons of pics!  i try to take pictures of everything . 
i couldn t believe aretha franklin passed away last week . 
neither could i .   it was the first thing that was on the news right after i woke up . 
sometimes you think people will be around forever _comma_  their aura is just so . legendary . 
yea _comma_  i try not to think about that though because then it makes me sad . 
i just finished eating dinner .   we had red beans and rice and with sausage .   i m as full as a tick!
that sounds amazing! how long does it take to make the beans? do you have to soak them? 
i had to soak them for   hours .   i think that s what makes that meal so satisfying   the wait!
i can smell the beans and sausage as we speak .  i always find after cooking i m never hungry .  maybe that s because i snacked the entire time i was cooking . 
i do the same thing!
found out some bad news today about my kids custody case . 
oh no .   in those cases _comma_  it s either the best news or the worst news . 
yeah _comma_  it really is .  due to a technicality custody is reverting to their father . 
i m sorry to hear that .   unfortunately _comma_  i know that same feeling all too well . 
i think i aced my supervisor exam!
woo hoo! that is awesome! congrats! when will you find out 
i should know something by tomorrow morning .   hopefully they tell me right away . 
i hope so too! i ll be sure to keep my fingers crossed for you! good luck!
i have all my kids  things ready for the first day of school tomorrow!
good think you re prepared 👍
i think i am .   i tried to do as much in advance as i could . 
hopefullybeveryday goes well . 
my daughter is in  th grade and just started school a little over a week ago .  she is already being bullied . 
oh no!  that s such a shame .   did you go to the principal?
yes   _comma_    and will again because it didn t help .  i try to cheer her up with hugs   _comma_    goofy moments   _comma_    and whatever else i can think of . 
i m so sorry!  i hope it gets better for her .   middle school is no picnic _comma_  that s for sure . 
i had a chance to cheat on my wife once _comma_ 
oh no! that s horrible .  please tell me you didn t .  
i did not .  i left there quickly .  it was not something i would ever want to do . 
awww _comma_  that is awesome! i am so proud of you! 
my dog got very sick and lay in bed for a couple weeks .   i was so concerned . 
that is so sad i hope your pet gets better
she did get better eventually .   during that time i tried to tend to her as much as i could . 
that is so sweet  _comma_   i think that is why she got better  _comma_   your caring ways
my roommate recently got a kitten _comma_  and he went out of town so i am watching over the little bugger . 
do you like cats? kittens are the best!
i love cats _comma_  i have one of my own .  i haven t been around a kitten in forever so it s a real treat .  i also don t have to sleep with the little brat at night either so it s especially great . 
yes i love cats as well i have one orange one and   dogs that get along pretty well all together
i had a solo competition last week for cello .  i was well prepared and knew my music well .  i felt great walking into that room . 
congrats!  how long have you been playing the cello?
i have been playing the cello for   years . 
how did you place in the competition?
i slipped and feel at work the other day .  several people saw it .  i wanted to just crawl in a hole and hide afterwards . 
oh dear that s embarrassing! i hope you didn t hurt yourself .  
just my pride
oh ha! i guess that s painful!
my ex and i broke up because he decided that he would no longer be willing to leave his job from overwork _comma_  like    plus hours a week . 
i am sorry .  breakups are the worst .  did he just not want to give up overtime or he worked   hours always?
he claims that he kept getting raises and felt obligated to work even harder .  so he just kept working more and more and i rarely got to spend time with him and he was always tired . 
that s rough but you deserve someone who is willing or wants to make the time for you .  never settle for less than what you are willing to settle for . 
my ex recently said that he was wanting to get back together .  i m not sure how to feel about it _comma_  we ve been getting along great since we broke up . 
why did yall break up?
the straw that broke the camels back is that he broke a promise that he would leave his job if they were over working him too much .  he decided he didn t want to leave after all and wants to keep working     hour weeks every week . 
that doesnt leave much time for yalls relationship
i came home today and the food i had put in the crock pot was ruined .  the outlet must have died and the food sat in there all day not cooking . 
oh darn i hate when that happens! i ve experienced the same thing in the past once . 
yeah it was pretty terrible .  i had to throw out a ton of food _comma_  and to add insult to injure i had to go eat out tonight . 
yep not always a terrible time to eat out at least . 
i let my friend babysit my kid last week .  
how did they do?
awesome .  i usually have a hard time letting anyone watch my child but he had a great time with her . 
how old s your child?
just barely older than my son .  i can definitely understand that . 
i was out walking by the lake over the weekend and there shore was just covered in dead rotting fish . 
what happened why were their so many dead fish?
i don t know  _comma_   that s what i would like to know! the best i can imagine is that the water quality dropped  _comma_   and they died .  i imagine it was pollution .  
i hope they are not using the lake for drinking water  . 
i have a really big game coming up this weekend .  i haven t played soccer since i was a kid and have been really nervous about joining an adult league .  
good luck! i m sure it will be fine . 
i just don t want to embarrass myself or my team .  i m so scared i m going to make a fool of myself .  
you re too hard on yourself .  everyone messes up sometimes _comma_  even the greats . 
several years ago one of my neighbors dogs attacked me and i had to go to the hospital to get stitches .  
yikes that s no good .  how many stitches did you have to get?
i had to get   stitches in one of the holes and   stitch and all the other holes .  he was a big dog _comma_  a little over    pounds . 
what happened to the dog afterwards?
last year i made a bet with my friend and he lost _comma_  so he had to buy me a nintendo switch .  i was so great . 
that s quite the win! what was the bet?
i made a bet that he would not lose    pounds in   .   months .  i was hoping that he would win the bet _comma_  but on the bright side i got a switch :) win win for me . 
oh! gotcha! i ve never played the switch but i heard it s an exciting console!
i am visiting my friend this week . 
oh cool _comma_  where does your friend live? is it an exciting location?
yes _comma_  i mean i promised her i would  and some things came up but i know i gotta stick to my word and make this happen . 
oh man _comma_  don t bail on your trip .  try and get those thing that came taken care of this week .  you don t want to disappoint her . 
oh i know i can t .  she had lots of plans for us . 
one time when i was little and playing hide and go seek  _comma_   my cousin talked me into remaining hidden even when our parents came looking for us .  after a while i realized that we were going to be in trouble  _comma_   and then we saw a police car pull into the drive way . 
oh no _comma_  i bet your parents were freaking out . 
yeah i guess they were  _comma_   they made sure to spank me and ground me for   weeks .  i was also told that i was a terrible influence on my   year old cousin  _comma_   even though i was   and it was his idea .  
oh that sucks getting blamed for it when it was their fault . 
so we are moving and i m having trouble letting go of a sewing machine my grandma gave me .  thinking i should keep it . 
do you get much use out of it _comma_  or is it just collection dust?
kind of just dust .  it meant a lot to her that i have it so i just don t think i can let it go . 
i guess you can hang on to it _comma_  or maybe there s someone else you both know who can show it some proper lovin  . 
one of my friends managed to pay off their first house at the age of    . 
well dang! that is very impressive! 
yeah i know _comma_  i m really amazed and proud of him .  to be honest as proud as i am i can t help but to be a little jealous too lol . 
understandable _comma_  i bet the had good budgeting skills and a nice job . 
i stayed at a friends house for the weekend a while back _comma_  and when i got home my bedroom was destroyed
oh no!! that is terrible _comma_  do you know what happened? 
my younger brothers went in my room and messed with all my things .  i am so angry about it
oh no  _comma_   i am sure they meant no harm  _comma_   they always say that they are more curious when they are young .  
today when i was home alone i was snuggling with a stuffed bunny my ex got me _comma_  because i missed him .  i feel so pathetic . 
it will pass in time _comma_  even though it feels awful right now . 
i hope so _comma_  i m tired of feeling so miserable .  i just wish i had someone here with me right now .  
aw i m sorry .  i remember feeling like that and it was horrible . 
my husband and i celebrated   years saturday .  it was such a good day of quality family time . 
oh that s great!   years together is a long time .  you sound happy _comma_  i m glad . 
yes i love a good day of relaxation and family time :)
what did y all do? did you do anything special that evening? 
yes _comma_  dinner :)
i went to the zoo last month  _comma_   i haven t been since i was a kid .  i went to a zoo that was supposed to be one of the top zoos  _comma_   however i couldn t help but feel bad for the animals the whole time . 
oh _comma_  i know exactly what you mean .  it s not the same as going as a kid . 
the enclosures all just seemed so tiny and it felt like none of the animals were able to have any privacy if they wanted it .  
yeah _comma_  it s no wonder these animals go crazy on humans sometimes . 
i won an essay contest and i get to go to washington dc for free!
wow! what did you write about?
i wrote about social security reform .  kinda boring stuff lol but it ll be fun to visit all the sites in dc
nice _comma_  well i hope you have a nice trip!
we are moving .  i m so pumped for new adventures .  
congrats! that s exciting .  is the new place far from your current home?
yes _comma_  a new state .  i am just imagining all the fun things and new things we can do . 
wow  _comma_   thats really big! i hope you have a stress free move .  i know it can be a little stressful  _comma_   but you seem very excited!
when i was in middle school there was this boy that sat in front of me in  th _comma_  he was always trying to get me to kiss him before class started . 
wow _comma_  really? did you have any feelings for him? 
no _comma_  the whole thing was really weird and kind of embarrassing really .  he sat in the desk in front and would turn around and basically ask me to kiss him in front of the whole class .  i only knew him from that class .  i usually would just smash my binder in his face instead . 
hahaha  _comma_   that is so cute  _comma_   i am sure he loved that you teased him like that! i bet your classmates also had a good laugh! 
i ve been out of a job for a while but someone i know has offered me an opportunity to do some work in my field
wow! what field are you going to be working in?
statistics .  i am going to help a real estate company build models to predict house values
dang! i hope you make lots of money!
so a friend and i entered a drawing at the mall and she won .  i wish i could say it doesn t sting a bit that she won . 
wow! congrats to her _comma_  and i am sorry that you didn t get the prize .  what did she win? 
a weekend trip to gatlinburg .  i would of loved that . 
wow that is a great prize! is she able to take anyone with her or is it just a ticket for one person? 
she is but she s taking her husband :)
i saw  man swallow a sword
wow _comma_  were you at a festival?
yes i was .  i thought it was pretty intense to watch
i have seen that before .  i have no idea how they can do that . 
i ve been packing  _comma_   packing  _comma_   packing and cleaning .  
o that sounds exciting .  moving or spring cleaning?
moving _comma_  not sure when yet but i like to be  ahead of the game .  i hate being rushed . 
ya last time i moved i was packing for about   months .  it s smarter to do it a little at a time and get things purged and organized .  
someone hit my car while i was shopping .  i am so mad they didn t even leave a note . 
oh no that is terrible _comma_  i can not believe that they would drive off without leaving any contact information! how bad was the accident? 
huge dent _comma_  i can t believe someone could do that and drive off . 
wow  _comma_   that is terrible .  i hope that you are able to catch them or find surveillance videos of who did it  _comma_   because most malls do have cameras in the parking lots . 
i remember back when i got to pick up my dog at the airport when she was a puppy . 
aww were you excited when you picked her up?
oh man _comma_  i sure was .  and she was so excited to get out of that box . 
i bet! what kind of dog is she?
my brother isn t very good with money but i just lent him some
uh oh  _comma_   be careful about that  _comma_   you don t want him becoming dependent on you for handouts .  
yeah i don t do that often _comma_  but i am certain he will be able to pay me back this time
well that s good .  i hope it works out for both of you _comma_  maybe you could give him some budgeting tips .  
i just can t believe some people .  i watched this woman throw her trash on a homeless man today . 
oh my god _comma_  you should have reported her . 
i definitely stepped in and made sure this man knew he didn t deserve that .  just makes me so mad to share a country with people like that . 
i am really appalled at people these days . 
so we are waiting on some news to move .  i feel like it will be this week that we find out . 
where to?
not sure yet _comma_  waiting to find all of that out .  i hate waiting though . 
me too .  well i hope it is to somewhere that you like . 
so i interviewed for my dream job last week and i didn t get it . 
i m sorry to hear that .   hopefully something similar comes along sooner than later . 
i really hope so .  i was really wanting that job . 
just remember to keep your head up and don t give up!
so i was driving to work yesterday and the driver next to me opened their door and threw up everywhere . 
i do hope they stopped the car at least ! that sounds disgusting _comma_  but its better than throwing up in the car right ?
yes they were at a stop light but i was so grossed out after seeing that . 
i can imagine when something unexpected like that happens .  i do hope they are ok now :) sorry you had to witness that !
i am so ready to find out where we are moving to . 
new adventures! i want to go west . 
i don t know where i want to go _comma_  just want to know where they are sending us :)
i bet you are nervous . 
a book i borrowed from the library got rained on and now it s destroyed
oh no .  i bet they are going to charge you for a new one . 
yeah .  i feel pretty bad about it .  
maybe they will understand . 
i found my dog s old toy .  it brought back memories of when i first got her
aww .  i had to put mine down last month .  i miss her . 
i m sorry to hear that .  what kind of dog was she?
border collie .  she was great!
after months of job searching _comma_  i finally got a good offer
what kind of job did you get?
i got a job in statistics
what do you do as a statistic
i have a final exam that i ve been studying for for days . 
how do you think it will go? are you confident?
i think i will do really well .  i feel prepared for it . 
what subject is it?
i stupidly lent my car to a friend . 
uh oh .  what happened?
he got drunk and took it for a joyride .  it didn t end well . 
that is horrible! i hope he was okay . 
even though i could ve gotten more money at another job _comma_  i ve stayed with my current employer .  it is a good place to work . 
well that s good to hear i guess .  what do you do?
i work in public relations .  i create campaigns for companies . 
what s your most successful campaign so far?
i recently did a very successful one for a medical company . 
i always need convincing to take my yucky medicine
i just had a job interview that went really well .  i m expecting a call pretty soon . 
that s amazing! what kind of job is it?
it s a statistical analyst job . 
i m glad your interview went well _comma_  and i really hope you get that call soon!
i recently moved to a new city .  i left behind some good friends . 
you can always make new friends _comma_  and talk to your old friends at the same time!
that s very true .  it ll just take some time . 
yeah but you never know  _comma_  you may make life changing friendships so be patient!
last week i was at the grocery store picking up body wash .  there were so many to chose from _comma_  but i couldn t help but buy my trusted brand that has served me well for so many years . 
you gotta stick with what you know sometimes . 
yes _comma_  why try something new when what you have been using has worked so well .  
that s right .  there s so sense in deviating .  
i have to show some brand loyalty! 
i have so much to do today _comma_  but it s raining .  i m ok with just staying at home and doing nothing . 
i feel you there  _comma_   i have a ton of stuff to do  _comma_   but i can t get any of it done in this rain .  
it sucks .  maybe it ll be dry this weekend . 
i really hope so _comma_  i am not sure how much longer i can let my yard grow before it gets too wild .  
my dog i had for five years just passed away .  he was hit by a car last night . 
oh i am so sorry .  that must be fresh on your heart _comma_  may he rest in peace . 
it is just so sad to have my loyal companion taken away like that .  
i can only imagine .  i am so sorry .  what was his name?
his name was han solo  _comma_   i am a huge star wars fan .  my wife thought it was a dorky name  _comma_   but i loved it .  
i m ready for hurricane season .  i have my kit ready and everything . 
that is great to be prepared .  where do you live?
south alabama _comma_  near the gulf . 
oh yeah _comma_  you definitely need to be prepared .  do you think you will get a hurricane?
i have been sick the last week and my wife has made my chicken broth soup every day!
wow _comma_  see enjoyment . 
she is such a blessing to me and spoils me so much .  
you are so lucky .  some men pray for that kind of wife
yeah  _comma_   i try to treat her the best i can  _comma_   can t lose someone that amazing .  
when i go out to a restaurant  _comma_   i order gluten free food items .   i have to trust that the cook and server take my request seriously .   if not  _comma_   my food could be  gluten free  but cross contaminated with foods that aren t and still make me ill . 
what kind of illness occurs if food is cross contaminated? i m so sorry this happens to you . 
if it s mild   _comma_    just stomach pains for a few days .   if i were to say   _comma_    eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten   _comma_    my joints also inflame .   so you see it can affect more than just my stomach!
you suffer from it more severely than most people i know _comma_  this can be devastating to people .  
inflammation is the devil .   i m just glad i found out how to manage it to improve my quality of life . 
we ordered   diet cokes with dinner the other night _comma_  and they all came out a different shade of coloring!
wow that is weird .   i love diet coke .   what was wrong with it?
i was concerned they were the wrong drink order _comma_  we lined them up and talked to the server and together figured out the syrup bag must be going empty!
nothing worse than a bad soda! lol .   i like the new freestyle machines _comma_  it s always just right . 
while cleaning out our closets _comma_  i always find some old item that reminds me how little the girls used to be .   last time it was a cute pair of jeans in toddler sizing we saved to make  jean purses  out of someday .   my kid is    this week!!!
aww .  i understand you .  that feeling is priceless . 
it definitely triggers some emotions!  then i m torn between keeping it a little longer or finally purging . 
it s alright to feel such sentiments buddy :)
my wife made me pancakes for breakfast .  i have a full belly and feel rather happy now .  
yum!!! i love pancakes .  is it your favorite food too?
one of my favorite breakfast foods .  she also made some thick sliced bacon .  she treats me so well . 
that is great you have a sweet wife! 
for sure _comma_  no other woman i would rather have .  
it is so great to hear about a happy couple :)
how can i complain when she gets up early to make me such a great meal!
i bet she is a great cook!
i told my brother that i was planning to propose to my best friend _comma_  but i hope he keeps it a secret!
that sounds exciting! is he good at keeping secrets?
he lets things slip once in a while _comma_  but this is a pretty big secret so i have confidence in him . 
fingers crossed for you!  i m sure it will be fine .   are you nervous?
i have a friend who is struggling right now in her business .   i m trying hard to be there to support and cheer her on . 
being a business owner is hard .  i m sure she is grateful for your help . 
right? even if i can t directly affect her business _comma_  i can help keep her spirits up to weather the storm!
yes _comma_  mental and emotional support is the best kind of support . 
i saw my neighbor bought the car i have always wanted .  i wish i was in a a better financial position to buy one . 
what kind of car is it? 
subaru brat _comma_  best car ever made .  its like a car and a t ruck all in one .  
ooh nice! just start to save  _comma_   save  _comma_  save where ever you can and you will get there . 
i know _comma_  it would look perfect in front of my double wide mobile home! there is a used one on the corner for      .  but that will take me months to save up .  
time goes by so fast .  you ll see .  
yeah _comma_  or i could buy more scratch offs at the gas station and hit it big .  
lol _comma_  well there is always luck!
i am in the process of potty training my daughter  _comma_   but when we go somewhere she still wears a diaper .  the other day  _comma_   we were at church and she took her diaper off in the middle of the service . 
i remember those potty training days!!!    i bet you were so embarrassed . 
it was not one of our best moments .  luckily _comma_  she was wearing and long dress and i had extra diapers so we could remedy the situation . 
thank goodness you had extra supplies on hand .    my son was the hardest one out of my   kids to potty train .    i feel your pain!!
i ordered a new toy for my son online for his birthday . 
oh _comma_  did you give it to him yet?
no  _comma_   not yet .  but  _comma_   i can t wait to! he s going to have so much fun with it . 
that s so cool .  i m sure he will love it! where did you get it?
my husband and i are going on our very first cruise in december .  i can t wait!!!
i love vacations i hope you and him have a good time . 
i hope so too .  i have wanted to go on a cruise for so long .  i m happy were are able to go this year . 
what cruise line are you using did they give you a good discount . 
we are going with a few friends _comma_  so they booked it and we got a discount because they are returning customers . 
my dad called me one day crying out for help .  i had to drive over to his house . 
oh my goodness! what happened?
he had fallen and bruised his ribs .  i had to take him to the hospital . 
is he okay now?
even though i m a christian and i serve god to the best of my abilities      _comma_       i have been in a rut lately .  last week      _comma_       during revival      _comma_       for the first few nights      _comma_       everyone was praising and participating in worship and just really feeling the spirit      _comma_       but i couldn t for whatever reason      _comma_       and it made me feel bad . 
oh _comma_  i know what you mean .  i have felt that way .  best thing to do is pray about it and don t be hard on yourself . 
yes   _comma_    i prayed about it multiple times   _comma_    and by the last night   _comma_    i was able to feel the spirit move and i was able to praise and worship too .  it felt amazing and it carried over into both services on sunday too . 
that s amazing! i m so happy your prayers were answered .  god knows your heart . 
thank you .  he is all knowing and i m just so thankful that he cares about me . 
sometimes i wake up at night and eat junk food . 
i ve never done that but i know plenty of people who do that .  its normal every know and again but don t turn it into a daily habit!
yeah but i feel bad afterwards .  i like to make peanut butter and nutella sandwiches with chocolate chip cookies . 
damn that sounds good _comma_  honestly its fine every know and again .  we all have a sweet tooth . 
we had a birthday party for my son the other day!
aw _comma_  yay!  how old is he?
he s   .  it was so much fun to watch him open his presents . 
i love that age!  my niece just turned six and she seems so grown up!
i was the captain of the volley ball team in middle school and high school  _comma_   so i signed my daughters up to play .  since they had an interest in it too .  when we got the practice on the first day  _comma_   the coach said that it was her first year coaching and she asked me if i would help a little . 
oh thats awesome _comma_  im sure you were excited to help
i was very excite to help .  i miss playing very much _comma_  so being able to play with my daughters and show of my skills a little was great . 
thats great _comma_  sounds like a fun time .  and you got to share time with your daughters which is awesome . 
a couple years ago _comma_  i was hospitalized and diagnosed with ms . 
oh that sucks _comma_  have you experienced the symptoms?
yeah  _comma_   i was blind in my right eye  _comma_   and my left arm was numb . 
oh damn thats terrible _comma_  i hope it didn t affect your life too much . 
my friend has been sick a lot recently and i am worried about her . 
that sucks _comma_  hopefully its just something minor .  you re a good person for taking care of her
yes .   she has been vomiting and having diarhea a lot
oh  _comma_   that sounds bad  _comma_   probably a stomach virus .  those suck!
yes .   it has just happened on and off for months . 
i am sitting here chilling out with my cat on my lap . 
thats great  _comma_   perfect time to unwind and relax  _comma_   and earn money!
yes .   my cat is relaxing and always sleeping
awesome _comma_  sometimes they can get annoying always running around and nagging you . 
i had a job interview last week
how did it go?
i am not sure yet .   i was very nervous
i d have been nervous too .   when will you find out?
next week i think
i spent a weekend at a lake house all by myself . 
oh _comma_  i would love time away like that! how did you enjoy it?
it was fantastic .   i found it so restful and peaceful just to get away from it all for a while . 
that sounds wonderful! my body is craving something like this .  thanks for the inspiration!
i had a get together recently _comma_  one of my friends brought someone who couldn t hold their liquor .  
oh no _comma_  did they do something embarrasing?
heh  _comma_   well they projectile vomited all over my carpet  _comma_   it was gross .  
that s absolutely disgusting!
me and my daughter went to the skate park the other day . 
did the two of you have fun?
yeah we did .  she can ride up and down the ramps much better than i expected her to . 
that s awesome .  my son has a skateboard but can barely stand up on it . 
i ve been out of work _comma_  and my dads been helping me financially . 
i am sorry that you are out of work .   have you had any job interviews? it is good that your father is able to help you during this time . 
no _comma_  i am filing for disability .  theres no way i can ever repay him
well _comma_  i am glad you will hopefully get some disability income .   it sounds like your dad isn t the type who expects to be repayed .   he sounds like a great parent . 
i had to meet my new physical therapist this week . 
did everything work out ok? how did you like them?
they seem ok .  i just hate having to meet new doctors . 
oh _comma_  me too .  i don t even like to sit in the waiting room . 
this is the first time ever that both of my kids have been in school . 
interesting _comma_  are you feeling ok having less bonding time?
yeah _comma_  it s just too quiet lol . 
i see  _comma_   i imagine time will start to fly once you take up a new hobby  _comma_   or school ends for the day . 
recently my family had a trip that was very disorganized .  basically drove a long way to hang see my family for a handful of hours . 
that s not very fun .  i hate traveling like that . 
same .  i wish i had just stayed at home instead of spending all that time on the road . 
at least you got to see your family for a little bit . 
that is true _comma_  i guess there is that to be thankful for . 
i had to wait in line at the store the other day for    minutes!
ew _comma_  that s always the worst .  what were you getting?
just some random food stuffs .  it wouldn t have been so bad but there was only one cashier . 
that s always the case! so annoying .  i love the self checkout options .  i wish more places had that . 
i had to go to my brother in laws funeral last week . 
oh no! i am sorry to hear of your loss .  are you taking it ok?
i m ok .  it just hit me hard seeing all those sad people . 
yeah _comma_  funerals are really sad but they can make one appreciate life so much more . 
i have some friends who are traveling all over europe this summer
wow i d be jealous
i am!  i would love to go myself . 
same .  i have a chance in a few years to go with the family but not    % . 
my and some old friends from college recently got together .  it s always great to see those guys again . 
i bet it is! i love getting together with friends _comma_  especially if it has been a while . which it seems to be the older i get . 
same .  and all these guys live in different places now so it s harder and harder to get everyone together . 
i bet it would be tough .   was there a special occasion that brought you all together?
no .  we ve had a group text going for several years so we just all decided it had been too long . 
thats so awesome! i hope you all had a ton of fun!
my wife bought some new clothes and in classic fashion she lied about how much she actually spent . 
hahaha _comma_  yes we women don t want to get the men angry .  but clothes are so expensive these days .  we just want to look good for our men . 
i know i know .  i just wish she could tell me up front .  i get more irritated finding out she lied about it . 
 i guess you can just tell her like you told me just now .  maybe she won t be afraid to tell you next time .  well maybe _comma_  lol . 
oh _comma_  i ve tried . 
this weekend i saw one woman being kind of mean to another woman of color . 
yikes _comma_  that doesnt happen too often in today s culture .   did you say anything?
no kidding! i don t see how those kind of people are still around .  no .  it had already escalated by the time i saw it .  we figured it was best to just keep moving . 
that might be for the best .   were they arguing about her color or something else?
no .  she just thought the other woman wasnt doing her job .  classic sense of entitlement . 
thats really annoying .  it would be great if people would just let other people be . 
i dont get to see my only niece too often .  i was supposed to babysit her recently _comma_  but it fell through .  i was kinda sad i didnt get to see her . 
i m sorry you don t get to see her much .  i don t see mine often either .  i m sure it did make you sad . 
we just dont live super close so it always makes it harder . 
yeah _comma_  i understand that .  i live about    minutes from mine and everyone is so busy all the time .  maybe you will be able to see her soon . 
the last few weeks have been spent buys school clothes  _comma_   shoes  _comma_   and supplies so my girls would be ready to go back to school .  there first day was yesterday and it went well . 
great! are you home all day or do you just get them off to school and then head to work yourself?
i m home with my toddler _comma_  so i drop them off and pick them up .  the school is exactly   minutes away .  i m glad my shopping in advance paid off . 
for sure! i bet it was nice to have the hosue a little more quiet too . 
recently had some test run at the doctors office and it took a few weeks to get the results back . 
oh that must have been torture! is everything alright?
yes fortunately everything turned out ok .  but it was nerve wracking waiting on the answer . 
i can imagine .  glad you are ok though! :)
my husband s grandfather recently passed away _comma_  and his three sons are acting very childish and selfish about everything concerning the will . 
oh no! that s no bueno .  usually the person that wants the least deserves the most .  thats sad
it really is .  the worst part is that they had arguments in front of him  _comma_   while he was sick  _comma_   about who should get what .  i wish they would have spent that time just loving and comforting him .  that s what my husband and i tried to do . 
oh that s awful and borderline abusive
yes _comma_  the whole situation made me mad then and mad now .  there is nothing i can do though except pray about it . 
watching my daughters play volley ball with their team makes me remember all the games i played in with my friends .  
ah _comma_  you must have great memories than

yes i think i will do well even though i just learned last week how to play!
my family came to visit recently _comma_  i always get so nervous about people visiting .  
that is 
i have to make sure the house is clean and that everything is in order before they arrive _comma_  nerve wracking!
that is so nice when family visits .  it is so much fun! but yeah _comma_  it is a lot of work for sure .  
i have a birthday coming up .  i really hop i get the gift i am asking for . 
oh _comma_  happy early birthday! what is it that you are hoping for?
thank you _comma_  i am hoping for a new camera .  it is about time to upgrade .  
nice! i hope you get it! cameras are such a wonderful tool to have these days and there are so many cool options to choose from . 
thanks _comma_  i really enjoy getting out and photographing nature .  
my dog go into the trash can and drug it all over the house .  i am so mad right now!
oh jeez! what a mess . 
i know _comma_  it is going to take me all evening to clean up!
i like dogs but thats why i dont have one lol
he is usually good _comma_  but this time his naughtiness got to him .  
i am going camping this weekend .  i got my tent _comma_  sleeping bag and tons of food .  i think i have everything i need!
excellent! stay hydrated!
oh i will _comma_  i am ready for whatever the elements throw at me!
sounds like fun!
it will be a blast _comma_  i just love roughing it in the outdoors!
the other night i heard a sound like someone was breaking in my house _comma_  i was pretty scared .  
wow _comma_  that sounds quite disturbing .  was someone breaking in?
no _comma_  it turns out the power had went out for a minute and it was the sound of the printer calibrating .  
i m glad everything turned out okay!
it has been raining a lot lately _comma_  i am really trusting the seal on our doors to keep the water out . 
yeah flooding is a real problems these days .  the weather is crazy! hopefully you and your house will stay nice and dry . 
i know _comma_  it really starts too pool up by our house .  it is getting kind of scary!
i would be scared too .  i hope everything will be ok for you .  fingers crossed . 
yeah _comma_  really don t want to deal with a flooded home! would not be good for my family .  
i bought a cake from the store and it ended up tasting terrible . 
you sort of gamble on store bought cakes _comma_  did you take it back?
no _comma_  i ended up just suffering through it and eating it .  
you are a lot bravery than i _comma_  i do t think i could it eat
yeah _comma_  i am afraid to return things .  the clerks kind of scare me .  
i was nervous about an upcoming job interview recently _comma_  i bought a new outfit and got a haircut to make myself feel better . 
do you feel any less nervous?  job interviews are always nerve wracking 
yea  _comma_   it made me feel better about myself and my chances  _comma_   or maybe i just like spending money
either way _comma_  as long as you feel a little bit better it was worth it .   i m sure you ll do great!
i love chocolate cookies because my grams would always make them for me . 
oh yeah! i love chocolate anything! but grandmas cooking is always the best of all!
nothing beats cookies made by grandma .  except for the oatmeal ones .  too healthy haha .  
not me! haha i love them all!
only if it has raisins to sweeten them up!
i found an old picture of when my oldest daughter started kindergarten    years ago . 
that must be a cute picture
it is!  in it _comma_  she s just standing with a huge smile on her face and a hello kitty backpack . 
so young and ready to conquer the world
i ve been teaching my young daughter to play video games with me _comma_  she s such a quick learner . 
what video games are the two of you playing?
minecraft and asphalt racing are two of them _comma_  it s amazing to watch a child learn and grow their intelligence .  
it s always amazing how quickly kids pick up on new skills . 
it broke my heart today when i went to the grocery store and found out that they were out of dean s french onion dip . 
you must really love that dip to have that much of a reaction to the loss of it . 
i do!  i ve loved that particular brand for years   to me it s the best out there .   but i guess there s quite a few people out there besides me that have a real love for it!
i would assume so _comma_  since there has to be someone out there who robbed you of your oniony gold!
oniony gold!  that s a very apt description!
i m glad i stuck my job out as long as i did   i finally got offered a promotion today . 
congrats! is it a good promotion?
it is!  i ll actually be the manager of the entire office _comma_  and not just the one section i was in!
wow that is super exciting .  not many people get that opportunity .  you must have worked hard 
i try to .   but i m glad all the effort is being recognized!
i put in to get a promotion at work _comma_  and i should know something either way by tomorrow . 
wow  _comma_   that s really exciting! good for you  _comma_   you must be nervous .  
on the one hand _comma_  i am but on the other hand i have to relax knowing i did everything i could do and worked as hard as i could .   it s kinda out of my hands now . 
that s great _comma_  what kind of work are you in?
i work for a medical supply company . 
well i really hope you get it .  you re right _comma_  you did what you could .  
last week _comma_  they arrested   people for animal cruelty at a nearby farm and the place was littered with dead and sick and dying animals that they weren t taking care of . 
that s horrible news!  i don t understand how people can be so cruel sometimes . 
i have a hard enough time understanding man s inhumanity towards their fellow man _comma_  but towards animals who can t do much to defend themselves?  i hope they put those people  under  the jail!
i know in some places _comma_  the penalty for hurting an animal can be tougher than that for hurting your kids .   nothing makes sense sometimes .  
where i live  _comma_   they re only now starting to toughen up the animal cruelty laws .   even so  _comma_   they lag far behind a lot of other states . 
when the england national team made the semi finals of the world cup
was that a good day for you?
so good _comma_  genuinely had my faith restored in the national team and everyone was having a good time larking about in good weather!
that s amazing! sounds like a beauty day! are you english?
but yeah   school started for the kids today and it was weird how quiet it was once the bus pulled away . 
oh _comma_  but i bet you appreciated it! summer can get long .  
it can .   but we had fun!  visited lots of relatives   _comma_    cooked lots of stuff   _comma_    goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible . a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand   _comma_    i miss having my kids around to do stuff with . 
oh _comma_  that does sound like a fun summer .  i read recently that we only get    summers with our kids  make them count .  
yep   and i have two left with the older one .   they do grow up so fast!
it s good to stop and appreciate teh moment sometimes .  
i had to clean beneath a desk which had not been cleaned in about three years _comma_  after there had been some flooding from a manufacturing unit .  it was so gross!
oh no _comma_  i can imagine so! was it gunky?
yes indeed _comma_  there was even a frog under there! so bizarre! 
oh goodness _comma_  glad you got through is safe lol
they arrested   people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!
oh  _comma_   that s not right .  i have a rescue dog  _comma_   she had a litter of puppies at a puppy mill before she was a year .  
wow!  it makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don t have the ability to fight back .   the rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm . 
i could chat with you all day! we have a lot in common  i feel the same way .  keep chatting? poor rescue animals .  
yeah .   but i m glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully _comma_  those animals can find good care and good homes . 
that s great! so sad for those poor animals .  
and in my opinion _comma_  the bond for those people was nowhere near high enough   they should have had to stay in jail!
they should  they say people who hurt animals will hurt people too .  
my son s soccer coach said nice things about his play last year and told me he would do what he could to get him on his team this year as well . 
that sounds awesome _comma_  i m glad he did well .  
i am  _comma_   too!  i m glad he s doing something he loves .   at this point  _comma_   i m just waiting on the text to see which team he made it onto . 
i hope he gets the team he wants .  
i m so glad the kids went back to school today!
you must be relieved! you excited for free time?
yes!  i can go back to having ice cream for breakfast!  i can watch law and order all i want to without the  _comma_    mom  _comma_   you always watch this!  comment!
that sounds seriously like a dream .  i cannot wait until mine are old enough to start school . 
how old are they?
  and   .  i have a bit to go haha . 
enjoy them now!  mine are     _comma_       _comma_   and    and too cool for  everything  .   lol
my two best friends are going on vacation next week and i won t have anyone else at work to goof off with . 
awww that will be a boring week .  sorry to hear that .  maybe you ll be productive!
on the one hand  _comma_   i hope so but on the other hand  _comma_   i ll get bored because there s nothing to break up the day .   just straight . ugh!  xd
i hope it flies by! 
i went for a walk the other day and one of the neighbors dogs was loose  _comma_   a bit white husky  _comma_   he was aggressive . 
was the owner not around? did the dog cause any harm?
he was growling at me and looked like he wanted to bite me _comma_  the neighbor finally came out and called him home .  was intense .  
sounds scary! dogs are very loyal creatures but can cause a lot of harm
the little kitten i rescued last friday passed away . 
that is very heartbreaking .  how did you find the kitten?
she was under my house  _comma_   crying .   her mother had apparently abandoned her .   i called my friend who said she was dehydrated and we did what we could  _comma_   but her motor functions quit and she passed away in her sleep . 
very sad to hear .  you have a good heart and are very caring _comma_  that is something to atleast be proud of!
and that kitten knew she was loved .   it ended sad _comma_  but i take comfort in those things . 
my   year old tried to play a video game but couldn t understand how the controller worked .  a few days later she was playing no problem!
kids pick those things up quickly .   and it ll help with her hand eye coordination _comma_  reading   all sorts of things!  
yea  _comma_   i was pretty proud of her  _comma_   especially since things are more complicated now than when i was a kid .  
yeah .   back when the only buttons on a controller were start  _comma_   select  _comma_   a and b!
i thought i had paid all my daughter s band fees only to find out that i m    dollars short . 
oh no! hopefully you are able to get it sorted out .  it s hard to keep up with all the fees for kids schooling . 
i keep all my receipts   i learned that lesson her  th grade year .   i just hate having to make the trip over to the high school because it s in the opposite direction of where i do everything else!
sounds like a headache _comma_  i know the feeling .  i got a letter saying i had a few days to purchase a purple shirt from my daughters school .  good luck!
i went through a divorce last year  _comma_   which caught me off guard financially  _comma_   luckily my mom was able to help with some of the costs . 
that would be rough .   hopefully youre in a better spot now!  thats awesome you had family to help you out too!
yea i m much better now _comma_  thanks to my mom .  attorneys make a killing on these types of things . 
i bet they do! i mean they do go to school for a while and study hard _comma_  plus the schools arent cheap but they still dont have to charge as much as they do!
when my wife left me it was so quiet in the house! it almost drove me crazy
i would love some quiet time to myself _comma_  consider yourself lucky!
hah _comma_  i hear ya .  i just got so used to all the commotion i suppose .  
i have a husband and three kids _comma_  its always loud in my house
when we were kids  _comma_   my sister and i once stole a blank check from our mom to order a pizza  _comma_   we got caught . 
oh no! how did you guys get caught?
my mom noticed the charge and found a the missing check from her checkbook _comma_  i ll never forget the look of dissapointment on her face!
i bet _comma_  did you both get in a lot of trouble?
oh yea .  grounded for a long time .  
i just saw a movie i had been looking forward to and it was terrible
what movie was it?  is it currently in theaters?
it was the new jurassic world
thats too bad! i was hoping that one was going to be good!
my coworker forgot to turn in the paperwork to switch our on call weeks .  he ended up costing me     ! i m so mad!!!
oh my gosh! i would be furious as well .  
he s such a worm .  i can t stand it . 
i am sorry that happened .  don t do him any favors . 
working from home can be difficult when people won t leave me alone to get work done . 
yeah _comma_  you need peace and quiet to be able to work . 
i love my kid but she is non stop with trying to show me the latest my little pony video _comma_  gonna pull my hair out . 
my son keeps trying to show me youtube videos so i completely understand
i have a big date coming up and i can t get these butterfly feelings to go away . 
that is normal that just means that the other person is special 
yeah _comma_  i really think she might be the one .  i hope i don t screw it up .  
well i will keep my finger crossed for you!
thank you _comma_  i am looking forward to taking her to a nice place to eat!
i bit into an apple and found a worm .  it was so gross . 
yeah i can imagine but a little worm wont hurt ya
yeah _comma_  but not what i want to bite into when i am trying to enjoy my apple .  
i understand but atleast it was not poisonous 
that is true _comma_  i should be thankful for that .  
i was hiking in the mountains and walked up on a female bear with her two cubs .  
i live in bear country . 
they really startled me _comma_  the female did not seem happy to see me . 
i bet i would have been scared
yeah _comma_  thankfully i was able to get away .  it took a while for me to catch my breath .  
i got a new dog recently _comma_  he is the best .  i am so thankful for him!
awwww .  that is so sweet! details .  boy  _comma_   girl  _comma_   breed .  
he is a male australian shepherd .  his name is charlie _comma_  he is super cute!
awwwww .  he sounds super cute! have lots of fun with him .  
will do! he is super cuddly and loves to follow me around!
there was one piece of pie left in the fridge .  instead of sharing it _comma_  i ate it .  i kind of feel bad . 
oopsy .  i hope it was worth it .  
it might not be when my wife returns and sees it gone .  i look super guilty right now . 
lol! can  you run out and get another pie before she gets home?
i could _comma_  i might have to buy her some of her favorite chocolate .  
i was at the park today and almost stepped on a rattle snake .  i almost jumped out of my skin . 
that sounds terrifying _comma_  so glad you did not step on it
me too _comma_  that would of wrecked my day .  it was so close! it haunts my thoughts even now .  
i can imagine i would have nightmares about that 
it might take me a little while to get over my fear and go back to the park .  
and be watchful when you do!
for sure _comma_  wouldn t want to relive that experience
i just got a bonus from my job .  that money came at the perfect time!
congratulations .  thats always a plus . 
it was a really nice bonus too _comma_  they were impressed with the quality of work i have done this year . 
good for you!
now i will have to work even harder and try to earn a larger one next year . 
i was going to go to the movies with a bunch of friends .  but they all bailed on me and now i have to go alone . 
if the movie is worth it you will never miss them . 
i hope so _comma_  but i am really missing them right now .  i didn t want to go alone .  
i understand .  its tough these days . 
it is hard to find reliable friends .  no one seems to show up anymore .  
i was out photographing butterflies and took the most incredible photo .  i am really happy with how it turned out!
i love butterflies because of the colors .  what color was the butterfly?
the butterfly was yellow .  it was a tiger swallowtail .  one of my favorites!
yellow butterflies are beautiful .  photography can capture some great images a lot of times . 
i saw my dog try to eat a dirty diaper one time
oh  _comma_   my dog did that  _comma_   too! i don t know how they think it s a tasty morsel . so gross!!
yeah _comma_  it s nasty .  i wouldn t let her lick my face for a while after that . 
i was just going to say the same thing! i m like  stay away!  
i was trying to take a nap _comma_  but my cat kept on trying to play with my head . 
i love cats . 
i usually love mine _comma_  but not when it is keeping me from sleeping
i agree absolutely
i just had a job interview and i m waiting to hear if i got the job . 
congratulations .  i hope you get it?
me too .  i m feeling pretty nervous about it
just relax .  if its meant to be it will be . 
i was on a plane ride and we went through some pretty severe turbulence
that must have been scary . 
yes it was .  i was so afraid we d crash
i bet
my cousin and i tricked my butler into thinking he won millions in the lottery .  i feel so bad . 
how long did he think he had won?
only a few minutes . 
that was funny i bet . 
someone came to my door with a gun _comma_  asking for money
oh wow _comma_  did you give him the money?
i didn t have any .  he came into the house and stole some stuff
that would be so scary _comma_  i am glad you are safe!
our cat had to many health problems _comma_  so we had to put him down . 
i m so sorry to hear that .  how long had your cat been with you?
i had him for    years  _comma_   he lived a full and happy life  _comma_   but i was not ready for him to go . 
it s always hard to go through that .  that s why i m wary of having any pets
but they make your life so much enjoyable while they are around!
i went to do karaoke with a guy i m dating and i discovered he s a really talented singer
does he like to sing?
he s kind of shy about it .  he had to get really drunk to perform karaoke
i bet he sings in the shower everyday . 
i had to do a research project and present it to my professors to graduate .  thankfully i passed!
you must have worked hard for that! i m sure it s great and you ll pass with a flying color!
i worked many long hours .  it was stressful but i m happy to have done well
yeah _comma_  such a relief to get a huge project done .  you must feel proud!
my sister has been playing a song i dislike over and over and over
that must be really irritating .  is she doing it deliberately?
she does it more because she likes it than to bug me .  it s going to be stuck in my head for weeks
haha   maybe you ll learn to love it! there must be something good about it _comma_  if your sister has any taste . 
okay . 
i ve never been abroad before _comma_  but i m going to spend two weeks in france next month!
that is great! what will you be doing there? 
i am going to visit a few cities and tourist attractions . 
i accidentally slapped someone in the face while i was playing basketball . 
oh no _comma_  did they get angry? 
no _comma_  i think she was just a little shocked by it .  i felt so bad . 
okay _comma_  i am glad that they were not angry .  and i am sure they knew it was unintentional so don t feel too guilty about it .  :) 
i let my friend borrow my car .  he s an international student and only has a permit . 
wow you are very trusting _comma_  i do not think i would allow a friend to borrow my car .  is it legal for him to drive with just a permit? 
i was in the car with him .  he just wanted to practice driving and he didn t have his own car . 
oh okay i see _comma_  i thought you actually lent him your car and let him drive around town with it by himself! 
i am at a cross road .  i am trying to decide my major in college . 
that s a big decision! what are your choices?
i was thinking about graphic design .  or _comma_  i was going to do something practical like nursing . 
if you want my advice   choose something you re going to enjoy .  i personally couldn t be a nurse   too messy!
i guess you are right .  i really like sketching and painting .  i can use my creativity side . 
i ve been trying to save money so that i can help my husband with the christmas shopping this year . 
i hoep you reach your goal .  it must be tiring . 
well at first i was a little discouraged because i wasn t making that much .  things have picked up recently though _comma_  and i feel i will be able to help him a good bit so i m feeling better about it . 
don t give up .  things may not be great one day but they always pick up eventually . 
i had planned to take my daughter shopping a few weeks ago .  we were all really excited _comma_  but the plans fell through . 
that stinks were you guys going school clothes shopping?
yes .  we were able to go about a week later _comma_  but the closer it got to school starting back i started to stress .  everything is good now though .  
that s good _comma_  school shopping is always stressful for me
i check in with my partner to see if we are okay .  i ask him if there is anything that we can work on to make the relationship better . 
okey no problem
i don t want to have problems .  this is why i check in with him . 
for mine too .  that was also i said . 
when i go out with friends i really have to be tight with my money .  times are really hard for me financially?
i understand completely .  one has to live within one s budget .  it can be hard though . 
i like go out but i have to really make sure that i don t spend too much .  i sometimes like to leave a tip if possible . 
it s only normal to want to live within one s means .  too bad you can t leave a tip every time . 
i find it appalling how my husband s family is acting now that his grandfather has passed away . 
wow ! thats quite unfortunate!
yes  _comma_   it is .  they are all being really selfish and childish .  my husband is staying out of it  _comma_   but i can tell that he is getting fed up with it . 
well handle it wisely
i have to run several errands for my father in law today and he wants them done before my mother in law get into town _comma_  which is at some unspecified time today . 
it sounds like a stressful day .  you have to just live in the present so _comma_  you will not be too stress out . 
yeah _comma_  i m ready to get everything done so i can relax .  i can t start on the errands until i drop the kids at school though . 
when that is over then you can do you .  we have to make time for ourselves . 
i really do miss my mother .  she has been dead for about    years now . 
i m very sorry for your loss .  thinking about and remember all of your good memories with her may help . 
it is a blessing and curse .  when i am having problems i think about what she would say to me . 
that s a good way to remember her and keep her close to your heart . 
yes _comma_  it is .  i know that time heals . 
yes _comma_  it does .  
my children are getting old .  they are starting to spread the wings .  so _comma_  i would have to let go and let them fly . 
that can t be easy .  how old are your children? sometimes i wish we could keep our kids small forever!
i have     _comma_       _comma_      and    .  they are doing stuff that i question but i don t want them to not tell me stuff . 
yeah you want them to learn _comma_  but it s definitely hard to see them doing things that you might not agree with .  
when i was in labor with my third child  _comma_   they were monitoring me regularly in the hospital .  the nurse came in and made a face and then called the doctor .  in the   minutes it took for him to get to my room  _comma_   my heart dropped and i started to panic .  he told me that the baby s heart rate had dropped and they had to preform an emergency c section right then . 
wow that s really scary! labor is a really terrifying thing _comma_  especially when something like that happens .  did everything turn out okay?
yes _comma_  everything turned out fine .  she is a healthy and happy three year old .  it was the scariest day of my life though . 
i can imagine .  when i was in the hospital with my   year old they lost all his vitals as well .  kids like to keep us on our toes from the start!
yes _comma_  they do .  i ope your boy is all good now . 
i finally beat level     on the crucible today in my favorite game grim dawn . 
what platform do you play it on? pc or ps ?
pc all the way .  i ve been grinding devotion points all week . 
pc is the way to go for gaming .  that sounds like an awesome type of game .  is it multiplayer?
i just found a hello kitty pot in my daughters room filled with water and old flowers . 
that s so cute .  how old is she?
it s not cute   _comma_    and she s nine .  by old flowers i mean   _comma_    it s a green   _comma_    stagnant slush with mold growing on top . 
oh mine .  that is not cute . 
when i enter the bus _comma_  i fainted .  i think that i got overheated . 
that s no good .  did you go to the doctor?
yes i did .  it was so hot outside and i did not have much to drink . 
got to make sure you take care of your self .  it s scary when your heat sensitive . 
i got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of my friends
it will be okay .  we sometimes do things that we regret . 
i fell down _comma_  and apparently said some embarrassing things .  
you have to forgive ourselves .  we don t need others validation . 
my daughter is graduating from college .  i cannot wait until she finish . 
will you be able to spend more time with her?
yes _comma_  i will .  she has been under a lot of stress . 
i can imagine _comma_  but it s good that her hard work is about to pay off . 
two years ago i got diagnosed with ms . 
what d ms?
its a disease that attacks the nervous system .  it was really scary to find out i had it .  i just went blind in my right eye one day .  two days and several test later i found out i had ms . 
well  _comma_ i pray you get through it
i found out that my daughter is moving out .  my youngest one told me so . 
how do you feel about that ?
i feel really sad because i felt she should have told me . 
hopefully she re considers you should talk to her about it
i let my sister borrow my car .  she is a new driver . 
that is risky _comma_  what do you plan to do
well _comma_  nothing .  i m sure that she will be a responsible driver . 
okey if she is no cause for alarm
i think that i will do good on my test . 
good .  you sound confident .  when is it?
it is tonight .  i studied really hard . 
i m sure you ll do great then!
i heard a song that i hadn t heard in awhile .  it reminded me of my high school days
oh how sweet _comma_  high school days is always fun
yes _comma_  it had me feeling nostalgic about the times when i was young .  
yes it does happen
my dad dies when i was    years old . 
am sorry to hear that _comma_  may he rest in peace
thank you .  i was crushed _comma_  and it left me with questions about my own mortality . 
i hope you getting better now
my mother fell and injured herself .  i wanted help and comfort her in any way possible . 
oh no! i m sorry .  is she going to be ok?
yes  _comma_   but bhe bruised her wrist  _comma_   and had a concussion .  i wish that i was there for her when it happened . 
oh man .  don t feel guilty accidents happen .  hopefully she recovers quickly . 
i had a nice meal and my favorite beverage after work
thats great what is your favorite meal?
it was a skirt steak with avocados .  i was very satisfied . 
that sounds so good i love steaks
when i started a new job .  i was nervous about proving myself all over again . 
it can been nerve wracking to start a new job .  but i m sure you did well _comma_  right?
i did _comma_  but i find it hard to trust people .  especially at work . 
it s wise to be careful but suspecting people all the time may not be healthy .  you need to build a good relationship with your new co workers . 
i am trying to quit drinking soda and i have prayed to god and asked him to help me .  the problem is i am addicted to soda and its very hard to quit .  when i do manage to skip a day _comma_  the lack of caffeine causes horrible headaches . 
i know exactly how you feel .  i have a crazy addiction to soda .   i don t think i can quit!
it just makes me feel bad  _comma_   that no matter how many times i try  _comma_   i still give in to the temptation . 
maybe try to slowly quit? like just drink one less a day
yeah _comma_  i think that s what i will have to do .  thanks for the advice . 
i went on a job interview .  i m anxiously waiting to hear if i got the job . 
when will you find out?
i still need wait another week . 
oh the wait is terrible .   what type of job?
a drafter . 
i just went to clean my kids sink a few minutes ago .  i found a bunch of toys in the catch and i am mad . 
oh no! that is not good! hopefully you were able to get them out .  
yeah  _comma_   all the toys are out .  but  _comma_   they got some explaining to do after school . 
lol! i m sure .  don t be too rough on them . 
i couldn t sleep last night .  i ended up staying up till  am and eating a large amount of shepard s pie . 
why couldn t you sleep?
combination of stress and new meds i think .  maybe i can get back to my old scheduled soon . 
i hope so! why are you stressed?
i saw my crush talking to another guy . 
oh _comma_  that sounds uncomfortable .  how did you play it?
i was a little upset _comma_  but it wasn t my business .  i let it go . 
i respect that _comma_  i think it shows character and honor .  i m hoping something rewarding comes your way . 
when i went to the store the other day _comma_  i seen a guy all tweaked out on drugs . 
oh geez _comma_  thats not good .   was he bothering anyone?
no  _comma_   but he seemed a little unpredictable  _comma_   so i used the other door . 
i dont blame you .   i probably would have done the same thing . 
holding each of my children for the first time was amazing . 
i remember that feeling with my daughter _comma_  it is indescribable . 
yes!! i can t think of any thing else that produces feelings like that . 
there is nothing to compare it to .  i wish i hadn t been waking from anesthesia in that moment so i could have been more awake .  
i forgot about my grandmother s birthday a couple years back .  i felt so bad about it!
oh no! it happens to the best of us :) have you talked to her about it when you remembered?
absolutely! i called her the next day and made sure to visit her .  :)
awww i m sure she completely understood and really appreciated you reaching out and going to visit her!
she did .  :) it ended up being a good visit anyway!
i was digging around in some of my old stuff at my dads the other day _comma_  and i found all my old paintball gear . 
oh _comma_  how cool! dd you and your dad play together?
no  _comma_   just me .  but  _comma_   i am going to go play this weekend at a place up the road .  it s been years since i ve played . 
that s great .  it ll be wonderful to relive those happy moments in the present maybe with your family . 
i went skydiving last summer with my partner .  it was so scary!
wow _comma_  that is scary .  were you nervous?
absolutely! i ve always been scared of heights _comma_  but i m so glad i made myself . 
it sounds like a great experience!
when i was a kid _comma_  i had a dog at my grandpa s .  he gave it away because it wouldn t hunt . 
how did you feel when he gave it away? 
i was very upset .  i was only like nine at the time so i took it really hard . 
yeah i would have been too .  as a nine year old kid that s hard to deal with .  
i tripped and fell in front of some people . 
ouch! was it a serious fall?
no _comma_  only my pride was injured . 
that s a relatively quick recovery _comma_  fortunately .  
i recently dug up a necklace my grandmother gave me when i was young for a birthday .  i hadn t seen it in years . 
oh my .  that must have been very sad .  i can t even imagine how you must have felt .  
yeah _comma_  she passed more than five years ago and i had forgotten all about it .  it brought back so many memories though!
i m so sorry . ! but i m really glad you ve got those pleasant memories and the memento to hold on to so you can remember her fondly .  
i just won an award for best yard in the neighborhood! 
wow that s great _comma_  you must have put a lot of work into your yard . 
i did _comma_  mowed it three times a week and watered it twice a day .  all the hard work really paid off .  
cool _comma_  i guess the grass is actually greener in your yard now!
it is _comma_  it really stands out from all the brown grass in my neighbors yards . 
i get to go to the park today for a bbq with friends _comma_  it should be so much fun!
ooh nice .  that does sound like alot of fun .  do you guys play any sport while your there? 
we often throw around a frisbee for a little bit _comma_  but we never get too intense with any sports .  
cool .  well enjoy _comma_  i hope the weather hold up . 
me too _comma_  there has been a lot of rain lately .  it should be fun hanging out with old friends!
yeah _comma_  i haven t seen my friends in forever .  we don t even live in the same state anymore . 
i snuck some candy out of my daughter s snack stash .  i feel bad because i had been trying to diet . 
i understand that feeling .  i ve had trouble letting go of those kind of cravings too .  has your diet been going well otherwise?
otherwise it s been pretty good  i ve managed to lose    pounds! just wish i could let the sugar cravings go . 
wow   _comma_    congratulations! sugar is one of the hardest things to kick   _comma_    i don t have the knack for it either   _comma_    but still you re making great progress!
my childhood friend gave me a watch for by birthday a few years ago _comma_  i lost it in a move recently .  i m pretty upset by it . 
oh no!  it always seems like things get lost when you move doesn t it?  is there anyway you can go back and see if its at your old place?
i ve actually checked and went through all the boxes too .  here s hoping it turns up one day though!
it will probably be where you least expect it!
i let my daughter ride in the road by herself on her skateboard the other day . 
oh wow .   how did she do?
she did great .  she s pretty good about looking out for cars . 
that s awesome!  that s great exercise! 
it is so upsetting that my daughter was in a car accident .  i am thankful that she was fine but we lost our car because of someone s bad judgment . 
oh _comma_  no! that s so terrible!
it was .  they wanted to blame my daughter but it was their fault . 
i m so sorry that happened! i m glad she s okay _comma_  though . 
i was feeling really down for a few weeks and my sister knew .  she drove hours to come see me and make me feel better!
that is a great sister .  i m sorry you were feeling down
yeah it was really sweet of her and made me feel so much better!
i am glad you are feeling better now
i was recently on a long international flight and we hit some really bad turbulence . 
that must ve been scary! did you freak out?
i didn t _comma_  but i was really nervous for a little while .  my wife didn t handle it quite as well . 
oh no .  i m sorry to hear that .  at least you both survived the flight .  
for sure .  and it was a great trip . 
i screwed up plans for a date night with my wife .  we ended up having to cancel and she was really mad about it . 
oh i bet you were pretty upset .  did you guys reschedule?
we did and i made sure to not screw that one up!
haha good! i m glad that one went well . 
me too .  who knows what would have happened to me if i did it twice . 
i was able to go back home to my parents for a few weeks recently .  it was wonderful to relax in my childhood home . 
it s always nice to visit home .  did your parents enjoy your visit?
they loved having me around again! our ten year old dog wouldn t leave my side . 
ha ha! i bet .  dogs are the best .  i bet he missed you just as much as they did . 
i ve been thinking about buying some new _comma_  softer skateboard wheels . 
what makes you want to get softer wheels? are those harder to skateboard on?
no _comma_  they make rough pavement feel smoother .  i think i ll just keep the ones i have for now though .  just have to deal with having a rough ride . 
i didn t know that about softer wheels! maybe in the future you can change to those . 
i took my dog i ve had for years over to meet one of my husband s sisters the other night . 
oh neat!  how did the little one handle it?
it did not go well at all! she pooped all over the carpet and she never has accidents at home . 
oh no!  poor baby must have been really stressed out .  
yeah _comma_  i think it might ve been too much on her at once .  i was pretty embarrassed . 
i had to take my daughter to the doctor the other day .  she was very sick . 
oh no!  hopefully its just the flu .   what did they say?
it was just the flu .  i got her some medicine  _comma_   brought her home  _comma_   and made tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches . 
that s good!  i hope she gets to feeling better soon .   the flu is no fun . 
so my sister is getting married in a few weeks . 
congratulations! i bet she is excited and hopefully you are excited for her .  
absolutely! the whole family is flying out _comma_  we can barely contain ourselves . 
oooo!!! that is so awesome! will you be in her wedding party?
so my friend adopted a new kitten very recently . 
i love kitten _comma_  but i can t have one where i live .  i bet it is so cute
oh  _comma_   she is absolutely adorable! i m so envious  _comma_   i haven t been able to adopt one yet . 
do you plan on getting one
bought a new car a few months back .  couple nights ago we had a big storm roll through .  i thought for sure it was going to hail all over my new car . 
oh man .  i hate that .  we ve had some pretty nasty storms come through austin in the last few months and luckily i ve managed to be in some random parking garage out shopping or eating when they ve rolled through . 
nice! we have a garage _comma_  but my wife takes up what little room isnt filled with junk with her car .  mine wouldnt fit anyway unless i cleared it out . 
lol .  well that s no good .  cleaning garages bites .  
i do programming work and i recently had a question i had to run by a co worker .  he is a programming wizard .  he easily handled my issue and was using terms and methods i had never even heard of . 
i guess in your field of work you would run across terms and methods which are unfamiliar
that is true .  i usually can keep up _comma_  but this guy is on another level .  
you ll find some like that _comma_  not much you can do
i had a meeting with my bosses the other day to discuss finally getting a promotion . 
how long did it take you to get your promotion?
i ve been working there for a couple years now .  i m feeling pretty good about my chances! haven t heard back yet . 
i bet that your bosses will give you the long over promotion .  i will keep my fingers crossed for you .  good luck!
i feel so good about knowing i am going to win the race on sunday .  the race is for my favorite charity .  when i win the race i get to give my winnings to my charity of choice . 
that s wonderful! do you have a charity in mind yet?
yes _comma_  it is my local animal shelter .  they will be there to cheer me on! 
i bet it will feel amazing to have them cheering you on! i have a feeling you ll do great in your race . 
my wife has had a trip in mind ever since i ve known her .  she recently had a big birthday so i surprised her with the trip .  we went and she loved it .  it made me happy to see her so happy . 
that s wonderful! where are you guys going to go?
it was just a trip to the west coast .  there was a handful of things she s always wanted to see do .  so we did all of them . 
i m glad you guys had a good time .  are you planning another trip?
not yet .  we try to take one big trip a year if possible .  we just got back from that one _comma_  so we will start plotting out next year a little later i would imagine . 
i live in florida .  when i go home once a year it is a grand occasion . 
where is it that you go to go home? 
i grew up in alabama .  it is not far from florida but still i get so thrill when i can go back to see family and friends . 
that s awesome .  i love going back to my hometown to visit as well .  it s nice to see family you don t see every day . 
my sons first day of school was the other day . 
wow .  like _comma_  very first? or just the start of the year?
very first .  i was so nervous till he got off the bus . 
how did he like it? how did you do?
i have a test coming up that i ve been studying for weeks for . 
oh boy!!   what is the test over?    
it s a japanese language test for college .  i feel pretty good about it though _comma_  been going over and over it every night . 
japanese language seems like it would be heard to learn .   good luck on your test _comma_  im sure you will do fine . 
i had phone interview for a job .  it went very well
great _comma_  i hope you get the job . 
thank you .  i wrote down a list of questions and key points beforehand . 
so you were really prepared .  
i saw an old movie .  it reminded me of my younger days . 
that s cool _comma_  good movies have a way of tapping into those feelings . 
yes .  it s almost like a time machine .  fond memories . 
sometimes it almost makes me want to go back somehow .  but it s also important to move forward . 
i lost my job because my company didn t pay rent at our location . 
oh that is so wrong .  how are you handling it?
not very well .  it makes me so angry .  so i go work out to relieve the stress . 
that s good you do that _comma_  i would be very frustrated too .  that s really unfair .  can you pursue legal charges?
recently my wife left me home alone with the dog all weekend while she was gone on a girls trip . 
oh i bet that was fun .  what kind of dog do you have?
i missed her while she was gone .  we have a mixed breed rescue pup . 
my husband was gone all weekend buying us a new puppy _comma_  so i understand feeling lonely! 
our computer system at work is goofing up a lot _comma_  but the development team just keeps saying there s nothing wrong . 
ugh _comma_  i bet that is really frustrating .  is it making it difficult to do your job?
sometimes .  it doesn t stop me from doing things _comma_  just slows me down and takes longer than it should to do the things i need to do . 
that makes for long days at work .  i hope they can fix it for you soon . 
me too!
every time my kids go to grandma s they get to eat all kinds of candies _comma_  and get new toys . 
omg _comma_  i bet they come home so spoiled . 
yeah they do! some times i wish i got to go visit grandma s like they do lol . 
yeah _comma_  what the heck i don t remember my mom being so nice when i was a kid! lol
i was really happy when my nephew was born  _comma_   sadly i was informed he had cystic fibrosis  _comma_   a genetic disease . 
that s sad to hear .  what s his prognosis?
he s doing about as well as he can be .  very healthy _comma_  but without some new discoveries he will likely have a shortened lifespan . 
hopefully medical technology will catch up to where it needs to be for him .  
i bought some cheap stocks hoping that they would go up in price .  they didn t . 
oh no! i used to be a financial advisor so i m sure that was frustrating .  i hope you didn t lose too much money!
not too much .  i only put in what i could afford to lose . 
as much as i hate they didn t go up in price for you _comma_  i m so happy that you didn t overdo it . 
i came home yesterday and my dog had pooped all over the floor .  he hasnt done that in ages . 
oh yuck! i m sorry that that happened .  what kind of dog is he? is he sick?
thanks .  i dont think so .  he has seemed fine otherwise .  i ve watched him on our security cam today and he seems fine .  he is a mutt from a local shelter . 
hopefully it was just a bad day for him and he won t do it again! i have a couple rescue mutts as well .  
yeah .  i love that goofy animal .   hope he s ok
i work for a software company .  i have been trying to learn a new language for some stuff .  i knocked out my first task like a champ . 
that s great! do you get a chance to learn new languages often?
well i have the opportunity _comma_  but rarely have the time to really devote to it . 
my ex programs for insurance companies and they all use the same _comma_  ancient language for their statistics .  she hasn t had to learn anything new for decades . 
yeah i get that .  i work for a startup so things change pretty rapidly around here . 
i landed an ollie on my skateboard for the first time in    years yesterday . 
holy moly thats great i cant ever walk normal
yeah it took a lot of practice . 
oh i bet
next week i am off work and going to the beach . 
that is wonderful! so you will be on a vacation? will you be going alone? 
no i am going with my wife and her family .  but we all get along great so it should be fun . 
you will be having fun in the sun .  nothing like a day at beach . 
amen .  it is much needed .  ready for some sun and a drink with an umbrella . 
yea   _comma_    once i vacationed on a caribbean island   _comma_    lovely beaches   _comma_    food and drinks . 
not too long ago _comma_  i took a trip on a plane .  the airline lost my whole suitcase!
oh man! how long did it take to get your stuff back?
the whole vacation! i was so upset! i didn t have anything to wear for the duration . 
oh wow _comma_  that can sure put a damper on things . 
we usually don t do anything big for birthdays but my wife got me an apple watch this year . 
oh wow thats fancy
yeah i really did not see it coming at all . 
i bet a shocker indeed i like apples
my boss and i went to lunch and had a personal conversation about some life issues .  
nice! what did you guys get to eat?
we just went to a local taco place .  it was a good conversation . 
that s good that it was a profitable  conversation! do you guys talk often?
it was more about just some personal life stuff .  not too much really . 
i came back from a trip recently _comma_  got called in the boss s office and was given a decent sized raise . 
ooh _comma_  very nice suprize!
absolutely .  i certainly won t say no to that . 
keep up the good work _comma_  whatever your doing . 
budget is kind of tight lately and i am really afraid my wife s aging car is about to bite the dust . 
oh dear .  i am so sorry to hear .  it is possible for you to get a second job?
i may have to if that happens .  we are making it now _comma_  but if the car goes it will be pretty tough . 
i can just imagine .  i wish there was something that i could do to help . 
it is ok .  we are probably too proud to take help anyway .  we will make it . 
i pray and hope that something works out and that the good old faithful car will not bite the dust . 
so i recently went through some old boxes and found some of my childhood dolls .  it brought back a lot of memories!
that is always a fun thing to do! i hope the memories were all good!
absolutely! i remember having so much fun with them dressing them up .  my sister and i would play for hours . 
that s awesome! did you show them to your sister after you found them?
so  _comma_   i may be in the market for a new laptop or a repair at least  _comma_   thanks to a little mishap . 
oh no! what happened to your laptop? if you get a new one which one are you looking at?
my daughter tripped on the cord and it smashed on the ground _comma_  not sure if it can be saved .  i was pretty angry . 
ouch  _comma_   what a pain that is! i can imagine  _comma_   i would be the exact same in that situation . 
i woke up the other morning _comma_  got ready and drove all the way to work .  just to find out it was a holiday and we had the day off . 
oh man that sucks .  i m so sorry because you could have slept in lol
i know _comma_  but the extra day of work was nice .  especially since i wasn t expecting it . 
see there s always a bright side .  you got a surprise day off from work!!!
it was wonderful .  i ended up being twice as productive since i got up early . 
that s awesome .  days off are the best!!
my new job is starting tomorrow .  i m feeling nervous _comma_  but really optimistic about it . 
hey that s cool it s a new opportunity _comma_  what are you gonna do?
it s a job they opened up for graphic design! i m super excited to get started and learn more from them . 
hey that s really good i m proud of you!!!!
going to my son s first pee wee football game tomorrow!
that sounds like fun! my son does basketball .  i bet he looks tough in his helmet and football gear .  
he thinks he does .   all i can think of is a bunch of tiny titans in helmets running around like chicks in a barnyard .    chuckle 
ha! they 
i put in a job application for a new job .  i am fairly certain that my credentials are enough to get me the job . 
thats awesome!  have you been scheduled for an interview yet?
i was _comma_  i go in next tuesday .  i am pretty excited for them to give me the job . 
i would be too!  i hope everything goes well with it!
me too _comma_  we shall see .  now the waiting begins!
i got a call about job with a good company that is in my line of work . 
that s excellent! is it a done deal yet?
no  _comma_   but i have the necessary experience  _comma_   and i m optimistic that it will work out . 
cool! good luck and think positive .  
i went to the petstore with my dog and he had an accident in front of everyone .  he had the saddest look on his face . 
oh no .  poor baby must ve been embarrassed .  did he cheer up?
he did  _comma_   the clerk walked over  _comma_   told him it was ok and gave him a treat . 
that was really sweet of them .  glad he got a treat to cheer him up . 
i had a video job interview .  that was a new experience . 
i ve done one of those before .  they are pretty cool .  do you think you will get the job?
i m not sure .  it was a little awkward and stressful . 
i m sorry to hear that .  i ll pray for you if that s okay and  then maybe you will get it  _comma_   but if not  _comma_   maybe something even better will come along . 
sure _comma_  that s ok .  and thank you . 
great .  and you re very welcome .  i enjoy praying for other people . 
i ve been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and the pain is horrible .  the problem is that the medicine that my doctor wants me to take has side effects worse that the pain . 
sorry to hear that .  there are no alternatives? 
maybe _comma_  i haven t been back because i can t afford to go right now .  i ve just been dealing with the pain . 
i can relate .  i don t have healthcare at the moment . 
it suck . hopefully we can both get coverage soon . 
my son got picked to be on the soccer team that he was on last year!
yay!! that is great news! he must be so happy he made it!
he is!  especially since last year s team won the opening day tournament and then won the regular season title!
wow! what a great team to be on!
yeah!  we had a group of really talented kids _comma_  and some very good [and patient] coahes!
the other day _comma_  my three year old didn t know i was paying attention to her while she was playing with the dog .  i overheard her trying to teach the dog how to count to ten . 
that is amazing .  she is a very smart girl . 
yes _comma_  i thought that was pretty good for a three year old .  when i asked her about it she said they were playing school .  haha . 
you must be proud of her .  that is a lucky dog _comma_  a bark for each count .  haha . 
i m very proud of her . 
indeed you are i am proud of her as well . 
i babysat and worked odd jobs all summer when i was younger to save up and buy a sega dreamcast . 
oh god i miss my dreamcast _comma_  i bet you were so happy when you got it . 
yep _comma_  i ve never looked forward to something so much in my life .  i still have the dreamcast as well .  
that s great i have pretty much all of the ones i had in my childhood _comma_  even the atari . 
i m gonna need your support here  _comma_   because i m going through something a little bit rough  _comma_   okay?
anything you need!! i m here for you!
i m    years old and i woke up to find that i d wet the bed last night .  i m . not even sure how .  i didn t drink a whole lot before bed or anything . 
don t sweat it  _comma_   it happened to me in my mid    s also .  couldn t even tell ya how or why  _comma_   just that it did . 
should i see a therapist or anything? is this indicative of some deep seated problem that i m not aware of?
lol i don t think so .  i think you ll be fine _comma_  maybe you were just extra tired . 
my uncle jebodiah is always looking out for me .  he recently told me that he had a special concoction that if i drank it _comma_  it would cure my herpes . 
lol! i don t think i would trust that concoction if i were you . 
listen  _comma_   my uncle jeb wouldn t do me dirty like that .  you may call it    snake oil    but i call it the miracle cure this world needs .  after all  _comma_   it worked . 
well then .  kudos to uncle jeb!
my cat was kept overnight at the vets recently .  i was so worried!
i am so sorry to hear .  i have a cat that i love very much .  how is the cat doing now?
she s fine now! they found out it was something minor after x rays .  i was so relieved . 
i am glad that she is much better . 
my car broke down on a busy highway the other day .  there were so many cars zooming past me _comma_  it was scary!
that is very scary _comma_  how did you get home
my brother had to pick me up .  he had to pull up behind me on the curb .  it felt dangerous!
that is dangerous _comma_  glad that both of your are okay
look _comma_  can we just be honest with each other for a second? having ebola shouldn t mean that i have to be grounded and miss out on my chance to walk on the moon during the upcoming lunar missions . 
okay _comma_  well if you have it then you would have to see a doctor . 
i saw one   _comma_    and he said if i gave him       _comma_       he would clear me for flight   _comma_    but i don t have that kind of money just lying around .  it s a real bummer .  now i just have to do super boring nasa desk work like tracking comets .  lame . 
now that is interesting _comma_  i wish you the best of luck . 
i am obsessive about being ready for anything
oh really? are you afraid of missing out on something?
i don t know .   i just see stuff in the grocery store and think i like that food and buy it because it is on sale .   even if i already have it!
well it is good to have extra food on hand these days .  you never know what major event can happen . 
my girlfriend s leg was bitten off by a bull shark last summer . 
oh my! is she ok _comma_  and was it while surfing?
she s fine now .  i spent a month in the hospital with her _comma_  then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab .  she was out spreading sacrificial lamb s blood in the water on a fishing trip .  gotta love her . 
did you recover the leg? and i once almost got my finger bit off by a snapping turtle _comma_  it wasn t a pleasant experience so i couldn t imagine hers .  you are great for staying there . 
it was swallowed whole  _comma_   unfortunately .  i just hope the shark seasoned it properly .  i won t stand for underprepared human thigh meat .  gordon ramsay wouldn t have it  _comma_   and neither will i . 
i forgot about plans that i had made with my mother over the weekend . 
how could you? oh dear now you would have to apologise
i called her right up and we rescheduled! i felt so bad though . 
i am glad that you were able to reschedule
i was talking to a british friend of mine and trying to explain why our president feels compelled to tweet
i am sure that was an interesting conversation .   what did your friend think?
they think someone needs to take his phone away
lol   i think that even the people who like him would agree with that
i was looking through the attic and found a box of childhood toys .  they brought back so many memories! 
that must have really been a wonderful surprise!
it was nice to find them all and think back to those simpler times
yeah childhood ends way too fast it s great when we have a chance to reflect on them . 
the last trip i took to chicago was by plane .  
nice _comma_  the windy city! had you been before?
i had! i love chicago .   the flight is nice and short too _comma_  though i wasn t feeling well . 
ive never been but would love to go one day! ah no what was wrong?
i think my electrolytes were off _comma_  i actually fainted on the plane and they made a whole to do about it . 
my university is posting live stream of students moving in and i was reminiscing about when i studied abroad in college
aww _comma_  that is nice .  where did you study abroad?
i studied in venice italy and travelled all over europe
wow _comma_  how exciting! i also traveled europe and italy many years ago .  i loved it!! wish i could just move there .  :)
i won a storage shed auction last monday and found my grandmother s old glass eye in a steamer trunk inside of the shed .  really reminded me of her and how much i miss her . 
wow that s incredible .  what was her anme?
rita may .  she used to mess with me by popping it out and showing me her empty eye socket just to get a laugh while she got drunk off of bourbon .  those were such good times . 
haha thats really funny .  i bet she was a special person . 
i m pretty excited for the upcoming halloween season . 
i am too! what are your plans?
well in september  _comma_   universal studios starts their halloween horror nights events  _comma_   after dark!  it s so much fun i can t wait to grab tickets . 
i ve been to universal and everything else around there  _comma_   but sadly never during halloween  _comma_   i ve always wanted to . 
i was loyal to the same company for    years . 
that s rare these days _comma_  i was with mine for  
nice .  i wasn t rewarded though .  they laid me off . 
i hope you at least got a severance package!
i told a lie to my mother . 
was it a bad one? and did she find out?
i was about school .  and i eventually confessed . 
sometimes the lies get so heavy you just crack .  good for you though . 
i got a job after a long period of unemployment . 
i know how hard that can be .  is it working out?
yes .  i was very happy to be gainfully employed . 
it does take a lot of stress off of you . 
i was in a car accident .  both cars were totaled . 
i hope you are ok _comma_  what happened?
they were running from the police .  it was nerve rattling . 
i can believe so   _comma_   hope you get justice  _comma_   and a paycheck!
so my family surprised me this year with a party for my birthday . 
that s always fun! did you get anything cool?
they got me the new shoes i ve been wanting .  i was so elated and had such a good time!
yay! i think shoes are a great gift . 
i had a job interview .  the guy really knew his stuff . 
nice _comma_  how did it go? was the guy nice?
yes _comma_  really smart and easy to talk to . 
that s great! did you get the job?
i don t know yet . 
our power went off the other night .  we were without it until morning!
that sucks .  do you know what caused the outage?
someone crashed into the power line i think .  it was so quiet and felt pretty spooky . 
you don t realize how dependent we are on electricity until the lights go out . 
i bought a raffle ticket for a charity where i have a       chance of winning a car
oh nice! that seems more likely than winning the state lottery .  that would be so cool if you won!
yes .   they were      but they only sell     tickets .   and the money raised goes to breast cancer research
that sounds like a really nice program .  where can i buy some tickets?!
jumpfortherose . com
someone helped me move . 
were they a close friend? and did you pay them with pizza?
yes _comma_  and i paid them with beer .  i was thankful because i had a toe injury . 
i had a shoulder injury when i last moved _comma_  except i had to pay movers and pretend they were my friends for a day . 
i bought a powerball ticket last week but did not win
sorry to hear that .  what would you do if you won it?
i would have bought a new car and a house perhaps .   but i lost : (
it is good to dream .  dreams can come true .  :)
yes .   maybe next time i will win!
i spent saturday night playing lord of the rings online . 
oh  _comma_  was it good? i ve considered it . 
it is good _comma_  but i sometimes wonder if i m trading real life for a fantasy world . 
only if you are choosing that _comma_  over real tangible moments with friends or outside people . 
i am so mad that our politicians won t do something to stop russian hacking
that would take a miracle  _comma_  or have some major money backing it . 
yes .   the republicans just don t seem to care about our country any more and i am so mad that putin owns trump
take some small steps and vote in other things for people with the right values _comma_  not just pandering to the ignorant . 
my goldfish died . 
im sorry to hear that _comma_  how long did you have him?
for   years .  i m bummed . 
yeah that is a long time for a fish _comma_  do you have plans to get another one
not yet . 
i had an unprofessional job interview . 
what happened? 
the receptionist ignored me _comma_  and my interviewer was not prepared . 
i hate when that happens  _comma_   they expect us to be on point every time  _comma_   yet they can t bother .  i usually decline anything after . 
my computer crashed while i was working on a project . 
oh no! did you lose a lot of work?
i did .  i hadn t saved _comma_  and i forgot to set up autosave .  it was very frustrating . 
i can relate .  i have lost whole essays for the same reason .  i had to call in sick for school because of it . 
my favorite team blew a big lead in the playoffs .  it was like drinking sour milk . 
im a browns fan i feel that pain
i hate when teams choke .  it makes me sick . 
yea me too it sucks
i woke up this morning and my eye is itchy and my right eyelid is drooping
you should probably go to the doctor about that
yeah i am going to see what it seems like tomorrow   not sure if something got in it that scratched it or what
you could have a tear on your eye .  you really should get it checked out 
yeah i will if it does not get better quickly
me and my family went to see a magic show for the first time today . 
i bet that was fun _comma_  who did you go see?
i didn t catch his name  _comma_   but he pulled a rabbit out of his hat .  classic trick  _comma_   but i ll never forget it!
magic is such a cool thing .  that suspension of belief . 
i have a job interview tomorrow .  i m looking forward to it . 
oh that s wonderful! is it a job that you would enjoy?
yes .  it seems like a great opportunity . 
that s great! i hope you do well and get the job .  good luck!
i scored well on an aptitude test . 
that is good _comma_  what are you going to do to celebrate
i had a few drinks .  i felt good . 
that is always good _comma_  have one for me!
so today my mother brought over a whole week of meals to help me out . 
aww _comma_  that was sweet of her .  does she do that often for you?
yes _comma_  she s always helping me out! i am so thankful for her she s an amazing mother . 
that s wonderful .  it s nice to have someone in life who cares for your well being . 
so i moved away from my parents not too long ago .  it s been a big change . 
oh wow .  how far away did you move??
out of state .  i m by myself now _comma_  so it s pretty quiet! i miss them a lot . 
awww! i know they miss you _comma_  too .  i hope you re finding some fun with living on your own too!
my oldest child needed braces but her health insurance wouldn t cover the expense .  it was close to      dollars and we did not have that kind of money at the time . 
i feel you .  last week _comma_  i spend      dollars to fix my daughter s teeth .  dentists ask a lot of money now a days . 
yes they do .  my aunt paid half of the cost for us and didn t has for any of it back because she knew we needed the help . 
ohh well that s good for you .  these kind people always help in difficult times . 
i was sitting on the couch after a long day taking care of work and all the mommy stuff the other day .  
sounds good so far
it was! my family was happy and together .  chatting and watching tv .  everything just felt right . 
thats a great feeling
my husband used to work out of town in a different state sunday through thursday . 
ohh he is so hardworking .  you are very lucky . 
yeah   _comma_    he does work hard .  even thought my children were with me and we kept our usual routines   _comma_    i was miserable when he was gone .  i would cry after he left every sunday .  luckily now   _comma_    he has a job where he is home everyday by supper time . 
ohh good for you .  you two are made for each other!
we really are _comma_  he brings out the best in me . 
i didn t have a car to get to and from work _comma_  so my parents actually let me just keep theirs for a bit!
oh thats great
yeah it was so giving of them to leave it to me for so long and helped me a ton!
thats always super
while driving today i went past my grandma s old house .  she passed last year . 
i bet that gave you some good feeelings
oh for sure .  good feelings _comma_  but i also miss her so much . 
yeah i bet .  but atleast you have the memorys
i went outside to get my paper this morning .  someone had ran over my mailbox!
o no! can you fix it?
no _comma_  it s completely demolished! i m feeling pretty annoyed . 
well it is not hard to build a mailbox im sure you can do it
my sister is a journalist and she got her first big story published in the paper today!
now thats some super news
it is! it s a really big deal and i couldn t be happier for her . 
thats great
so my partner gave me the biggest surprise this week . 
what did they do?
he got us a trip to hawaii! i couldn t believe it _comma_  i am so elated!
that is awesome! i bet your happy about that
i finally went and adopted a cat last month and go way more than i expected!
oh my gosh! how many did you adopt?!
well it was only supposed to be her _comma_  but we found out she was pregnant! she popped out a whole litter of adorable . 
oh _comma_  i see! what a lovely surprise though .  what did you do with her litter?
i had to leave town last week and that meant leaving my pets who are my babies .  i needed someone who could take care of them properly . 
yeah it is hard to leave our animals behind
it is very hard! the only one who i d let do it was my sister and she did an amazing job . 
that is nice of her!
so i finally decided to take my dog for his first dog park visit . 
aww that s so cute! did he enjoy it?
it s hard to tell! he refused to leave my side the entire time and just watched the other dogs play . 
poor guy was just nervous _comma_  i m sure the more you take him the more he will venture away from you and have some fun!
im embarrassed to admit i forgot to pick up my brother from worth the other day after agreeing to
well hopefully he is understanding _comma_  if he is anything like my brother nothing a cold   pack won t fix . 
ha ha _comma_  he was a little miffed .  he got over it though when i stopped and got him ice cream on the way back though! i felt like such a jerk . 
all is well that ends well _comma_  especially with family they gotta give ya do overs . 
i finally took the plunge and decided to go back to school this year . 
that is a great idea! how is it so far?
i start next week! i was super hesitant at first _comma_  but i m so glad i m making myself do it . 
yeah you will improve yourself and feel good about it
i was going through some stuff and found a box of jewelry my grandparents had gifted me through the years . 
thats great
yeah _comma_  it really made me think of them and old times . 
i bet it did
i recently had a shop fix my car .  they worked so fast!
that s good _comma_  did you have to wait there or were you able to go home?
i was able to go home _comma_  but i realize now that i didn t even have to
haha that;s rare when it comes to mechanics . 
my husband is going through the process of quitting smoking on top of dealing with drama from his parents .  he is having a hard time . 
im sorry _comma_  thats awful .  its a shame his parents arent being more supportive
they aren t being supportive at all   _comma_    but that s not surprising   _comma_    that don t support him very well in anything .  i just wish i could make it better for him   _comma_    but i can t
im sure he appreciates having you around though
i have some great friends .  one of them drove me to the airport tomorrow
that was really nice of them .  i bet you re appreciative . 
yes i am _comma_  they are great
i m sure you ll do a favor for them in the future . 
we just found out the person working in our accounting department has been stealing money from our company for years . 
yikes! that is terrible! what a awful thing to do! i am glad he finally got busted! wow  _comma_   for years  _comma_   huh?
yes _comma_  it just makes me sick to my stomach .  you think you know someone but the whole time they are stealing you blind .  i don t get some people
yeah _comma_  me either .  hopefully they regret what they did and are able to learn something from this . 
i miss high school .  my girlfriend was the best
i enjoyed highschool _comma_  too . 
that s great .  college was also fun
college was pretty laid back for me _comma_  i did a lot of online classes . 
i recently bid farewell to a good friend .  i miss her
i am sorry for your loss .  i hope you can find comfort during this difficult time . 
thank you _comma_  that means a lot .  i will see her again
you will _comma_  and that is what gives us the strength to face tomorrow!
i lost my car keys .  i m such a fool!
happens to everybody .  my girlfriend    _comma_     who is the smartest person i know    _comma_     has had to make   duplicates of her car keys because she s locked herself out so much .  she s so forgetful because she s so efficient and on top of everything else important    _comma_     that sometimes she misses the small things .  maybe that s true in your case    _comma_     too!
that s pretty funny _comma_  and makes me feel better .  this is the first time i ve lost my keys so i hope to keep it that way!
i ve heard some people place theirs in a bowl near the front door as soon as they come home _comma_  or they stick it in the fridge with their lunch .  silly things to make sure they can keep it together . 
i came home the other day and my roommate had a friend over .  i ve only seen him with a friend over once in my   .   years of living here . 
wow .  that must be a very special friend .  i net you were surprised . 
yeah i sure was _comma_  he seems to like this one much better than the last one he had over .  he couldn t wait for that first guy to leave . 
oh dear .  maybe he is a loner and doesn t like friends . 
one of my co worker came and asked me a lot of really weird questions about my supervisor .  it seemed suspicious so i pretty much told her i didn t know any of the answers to her questions .  i don t think she likes my supervisor . 
oh that s just a recipe for disaster    % of the time . 
yeah i figured it was _comma_  so i just played dumb and let my supervisor know .  my supervisor has always been good to me . 
mine has too .  i think you did the right thing by not getting involved . 
man there aren t many people i would give my last couple hundred dollars to _comma_  with one notable exception . 
hm _comma_  who might that be? 
my buddy stefan .  he used it to print hundreds of bootleg concert posters .  we sold them and netted       a piece!
thats neat .  you must trust him a lot given his track record of making money!
i finished first in a race .  i feel like gold
oh my goodness!  that s amazing!  congratulations! was it your first gold medal race?
yes! it was my first victory .  all my hard work is paying off
that is awesome! it is for running?
some of my friends told me that they had a big surprise for me .  they know i hate surprises _comma_  but i complied and let the blindfold me and drive me out to the location . 
that sounds exciting and scary .   what was the surprise?
they had decided to pool their money together and get me one big present together .  it was a flying lesson at the local airport .  
that is so awesome .   did you have fun? and more important _comma_  are you a pilot now?
i found an old photo album at my grandma s house that had pictures of me when i was a kid
that s cool _comma_  did it bring back some good memories? 
yeah _comma_  it did .  i really miss the   s .  everything seemed a lot simpler in those days
i love the    s also _comma_  best decade in my opinion!
when i was in middle school _comma_  i had a friend come over to ride horses with me .  after riding my mother pressured me to get on a horse bareback i wasn t comfortable riding .  she made such a big scene that i got on to make her stop . 
oh no _comma_  did you get hurt?
yes  _comma_   the horse took off running and i got thrown into a metal fence .  my mother then proceeded to yell and me and make fun of me for trusting her .  she told me that i should never trust anyone not even my own parents  _comma_   it was really embarrassing to get yelled at in from my friend .  afterwards my ribs hurt for   months .    
yikes _comma_  i m sorry to hear that .   that sounds horrifying!
my friend really wanted me to go rollerblading with him _comma_  but i haven t been rollerblading since i was a little kid .  i didn t want to roll into a car . 
so what did you do?
we went _comma_  but it was still pretty terrible because i felt completely uncomfortable and was bent over the whole time ready to catch myself . 
well _comma_  i bet your friend had a good time with you being there .  sometimes we have to make sacrefices for those we care about . 
my husband is on the road a lot _comma_  i hardley ever see him . 
i m sorry .  my wife could sympathize with you since i m gone a lot on business as well .  
yes _comma_  its hard but i try to remember he does it for our family! i have been trying to adapt to enjoying alone time . 
i m sorry you feel lonely .   my wife says she ofens feels the same way .   i know your husband misses you awfully while he s away .   i love having chats with my wife every day when i m gone . 
i have an interview for a job that i don t feel qualified for
just be confident and you will do great!
i will try .  i m a pretty anxious person in general so it s hard
you got this! 
i m moving in a few months to a new state _comma_  i m starting to feel nervous . 
ah _comma_  yeah moving can be hectic! are you moving somewhere you want to be?
to my husband hometown so it ll be new for me but he is excited to be back near family . 
that s a positive at least _comma_  good luck on the move!
i saw a dog get hit by car today on the highway . 
oh no!!! did you see what happened to the dog?!
it was pretty tramatic   _comma_    i still see the dog getting hit in my head and the sound .  no   _comma_    i was on my way to work   _comma_    i couldn t stop :(
that s so sad! what on earth is a dog doing around a highway?! that just breaks my heart .  
i can t even begin to tell you how nervous i was about my first tattoo . 
i can understand the anxiety .  its a whole new different experience for first timers!
definitely! i get lightheaded when i see my own blood  _comma_   and my pain threshold was low at the time .  it turned out great though  _comma_   and now i have several!
same thing happens to me .  i sometimes faint at the sight of a needle! its good that your experience went well! now you wont be nervous anymore .  
i love my husband! he has been so sweet this week!
aww! that is so cute! has he done something special this week that made him extra sweet?
he knew i had a rough day today so he brought home my favourite wine and taco bell! it s the little things :)
that is so sweet of him .  its definitely the little things .  
it s been a great week! 
good! what s been going on?
i got a promotion at work that i wasn t expecting! 
woo! congrats on that! that s always a nice surprise .  what do you do?
music is a powerful thing .  sometimes it feels like it can transport you to another time and place .  you know what i mean?
yeah exactly!  music is awesome .   
who can deny it? my dad passed away   years ago .  sometimes i put on his old records and imagine what it would have been like to hang out with him in the   s . 
yeah he sounds amazing .   sorry for your loss friend :(
i was feeling kind of down so i ended up snuggling with a stuffed rabbit i have .  it brought back a lot of good old memories .  
never too old or too manly to snuggle a stuffed animal .  my mom said i used to carry this blanket with me when i was a toddler     _comma_      everywhere i went .  i wish i still had it .  if i did     _comma_      i d consider using it again     _comma_      or at the very least passing it down to my own kid .  what s the harm     _comma_      you know? if something gives you comfort and doesn t bother anyone else     _comma_      there should be no shame . 
awe yeah thanks .  he s pretty soft even though he some derpy eye that point in opposite directions .  brings me a lot of comfort and reminds me that someone cares . 
well     _comma_      if i were you     _comma_      i d keep it up     _comma_      whether or not my spouse laughed at me     _comma_      or a new girlfriend boyfriend     _comma_      whatever .  it s not childish to me .  life is stressful enough .  let us snuggle what we want . 
my dog got hit by a car . 
aw! that s horrible _comma_  i m sorry to hear that . 
he did not live .  i ve never felt so sad before . 
that s so sad _comma_  i don t even know what to say!
some random guy was in my backyard _comma_  i didn t realize before i looked outside that i was missing pants . 
oh no! that is really creepy _comma_  why is he in your backyard?
turns out he was the cable guy fixing a wire .  still mad he didn t ask permisson first .  
yeah  _comma_   that s illegal i think  _comma_   they need to at least knock or ring the door bell!
my family is still hasn t recovered from the untimely passing of my father two years ago . 
i am so sorry to hear that .  it can t be easy for you and your family . 
my siblings and i are managing _comma_  and have found some peace .  my mother is a different story .  it was just so sudden and unexpected . 
no doubt it will take time to process .  i wish your family the best .  stay strong my friend . 
i ve got a week off from work .  time to sleep in and binge watch my favorite shows . 
what shows are your favorite? that must be nice . 
i like it s always sunny in philadelphia .  i m rewatching it for the third time
must be nice _comma_  got any nice snacks?
i was really stressed out and grad school and had no choice but to drop out to keep my sanity . 
good choice .  you re health is more important than some grad degree .  
that is what i was thinking at the time _comma_  but i ve been having a really tough time finding a job where i can advance into a higher position .  i always seem to get positions with no mobility . 
i think nowadays employers just want experience .  so it should be easier once you have that .  
i tripped on some steps in front of a whole bunch of people on my way to class . 
ah _comma_  i hate when that happens! how embarrassed were you?
it was pretty humiliating .  i fell flat on my face . 
sorry to hear that .  hopefully you re not seriously hurt! 
my boyfriend is sick .  he can t eat much so i made some soup for him
you re sweet _comma_  what kind of soup did you make him?
i made chicken noodle soup .  
i love chicken noodle _comma_  he must be so grateful . 
i had a meeting last week where i gave a presentation over the wrong documentation and no one said anything until after the meeting . 
i bet that was a little embarrassing . 
after i figured out what i did _comma_  i sure was .  ate at my cube ever since i don t even want to make eye contact with anyone . 
i am sure it was not as bad as you think .  
i have a really big meeting next week .  i have rehearsed what i am to go over all this past week and plan to practice a little more this weekend .  
wow! what kind of meeting is it?
it s a meeting presenting a new product to the board .  big stuff and big money for the company . 
dang! i hope you have successful meeting then!
i caught my boyfriend texting his ex
oh no _comma_  was it romantic texts?
it was definitely a bit flirty .  i think he misses being with her
that s sad .  i hope you are ok . 
i know i broke up with my ex _comma_  but i can t help but feel irritated when he talks about going on dates . 
that must be weird to talk to your ex still . 
we actually get along really well and are much better friends than a couple .  i guess i still just get a littler territorial _comma_  i think he does too .  
you must have feelings for him that are lingering . 
i can t wait to see my final grades .  i think i got all a s this semester . 
nice! it feels good to be confident .  when do they come out?
on monday .  i m going to treat myself if i did well
as you should .  you must have good teachers too!
i was very upset when i found my kitten today . 
why? what happened to it? is it okay?
no _comma_  i had to put it down .  it ate a poisonous plant .  he should not have been outside . 
that sounds terrible _comma_  i hope you didn t cry alot . 
i cried a bit _comma_  but kept it together for my little girl because she had let him out . 
i enjoy visiting the nursing home on occasion . 
oh yeah?  do you know someone that lives there?
not really  _comma_   i take my daughter to see them  _comma_   so many of them have no visitors at all . 
yeah .   that s awesome that you do that though .   makes for some special moments with your daughter and teaches her stuff . 
she likes to bake _comma_  so we take them what she makes :)
that sounds cool!  i bet she cooks good!
she is pretty good for an eleven year old _comma_  better than i was . 
haha same here!  
i had a secret and went to my mother to confide in her _comma_  as well as get off my chest .  i know she would never betray my secret and can always count on her . 
i am so happy for you that you have someone you can trust so completely . 
yes _comma_  i sure do! there aren t many people you can feel that way with and i am so grateful!
hopefully she knows how much this means to you . 
my son applied to a prestigious college and the wait killed us .  i was anxious and nervous waiting to see if he was accepted!
did he get accepted? i hope so
he did! he s in his  rd year  _comma_   going to be an aerospace engineer  _comma_   so we are very proud of him . 
omg that s amazing _comma_  good on him! you must be so proud
my sister passed away several years ago .  she took her life  _comma_   and my mother and i found her right after she did it .  this was very painful  _comma_   traumatic and hard for us all . 
oh wow  _comma_   how did your mother handle this  _comma_   how did you handle it  .  i can only imagine the pain . 
it didn t really seem to sink in for my mother for awhile   _comma_    she was in denial .  but   _comma_    it was so hard when it did .  i went into a depression for awhile   _comma_    as she was my only sibling and we were very close . 
that is really painful _comma_  i hope everything becomes better soon . 
when my son first started college  _comma_   i felt so much love and affection  _comma_   but it was definitely hard to see him go! i was very proud though . 
where did he go study at? i can imagine how hard that could be .  but it s good to see him following his dreams\
he went to the university of alabama in huntsville .  it s focused on science  _comma_   engineering  _comma_   etc .  he s going to be an aerospace engineer .  it s great to see him go for his dreams!
aerospace engineer that sounds very interesting .  hopefully he will stay focused and reach his goals . 
we went on vacation a few weeks ago and went to the beach _comma_  it was so relaxing and great .  i really enjoyed the time with my family . 
aww that s amazing _comma_  i am going on vacation next week and i can t wait
that s great! i m sure you earned it _comma_  just like we do .  it s so good to get some time away from the hustle and bustle of life!
i know! i am sure you were able to recharge your batteries 
i am looking forward to next week! my husband has been out of town on business for several weeks and comes home next weekend!
do you have any special welcome back events planned?
i am going to cook a special meal and see if he wants to go out _comma_  just us two .  i know he will like that . 
that sounds great .  does he travel often?
my husband has been out of town a few weeks for work but is coming back next weekend .  i have a surprise night planned for just us .  i am optimistic and sure he will really enjoy it . 
how exciting! i hope everything goes as planned!
thanks! we ve been married almost    years but i try to keep things fun and spend time together . 
sounds like you have a good relationship .  i hope when i get married it turns out just as good . 
my son went back to college recently and it had me feeling a bit nostalgic .  i could just picture him starting kindergarten and it seemed not so long ago!
aww .  im sure you must feel proud of him
yes  _comma_   very .  but  _comma_   time sure has flown by with him growing up .  i can just see his little blonde head when he was   and just starting school!
that sounds so cute
i was promoted to a team leader and i felt very secure i could do well at the job .  i had years of experience and was ready for a leadership role . 
that is good news .  its always good when what you learn helps you get ahead
yes   _comma_    thank you! i had worked very hard through the years   _comma_    and i felt that i earned it   _comma_    and would do well at it . 
i hope you do well and excell
there was an incident where one of my back neighbors called my young son a name and made fun of him .  i was so mad _comma_  beyond angry!
an adult did this? 
yes   _comma_    and she had two children of her own   _comma_    similar in age .  her son also weighed more than mine! she did it because my son rode his bike through the corner of her yard as rode around the circle   _comma_    that made her mad! can you believe that??
i dont get people sometimes .  who does that that sort of thing . 
last week my granddaughter started school for the first time .  i worried about her the entire day . 
aww _comma_  they grow up so fast!!  how did she do?
it turns out she loves and and i was a mess for   hours for nothing .  
haha _comma_  i m sorry you were so upset for nothing!  but it s so great that she loves school .   i hope she loves learning her whole life . 
i always try and plan everything in advance to bring everything we need when we go on vacation .  we recently went on our honeymoon and i didn t do very well this time .  ugh!
what went wrong?
i forgot everything .  i guess i was so excited about the wedding  _comma_   i totally failed at packing this time .  oh well  _comma_   it was still fun . 
that is all that matters _comma_  its about the love . 
one day i was visiting a friend and her boyfriend came up and kissed me _comma_  while i was waiting for my friend to return from another room! it was sneaky and repulsed me!
i understand .  did you told your friend?
i didn t . only because of her situation .  she had custody of her very ill and handicapped infant grandson  _comma_   she wasn t working so depended on him financially and she was very much in love with him .  she already suspected he was with other women  _comma_   and stayed . 
wow _comma_  it is terrible . 
the other night i was home alone and all of a sudden i heard someone knocking at the door really loud and they wouldn t stop .  i was so scared . 
did you go see who it was?
no _comma_  i ignored them and they finally went away .  i was just about to call the police before they left though .  i hope that doesn t happen again . 
no that s scary stuff . 
i was trying to ignore the fact that my   th birthday was coming up but my family decided to throw me a surprise party . 
that is great .  what is it fun?
it was so much fun and such a happy night .  i m trying to embrace my age now and not ignore it any more
that is always difficult . 
a few weeks ago  _comma_   my husband and i had a big argument .  i said some pretty hurtful things  _comma_   and wished i hadn t .  i felt very bad and disappointed in myself afterwards . 
i am single and never been married .  i assume arguments are part of marriage . 
yes _comma_  that s true .  i tend to be a bit more verbal on my end and say things i regret later .  
im bad at giving advice especially to people i dont know .  im the opposite .  im too mellow .  and that sometimes gets me in trouble . 
one night when my kids and i came home _comma_  i saw a shadow in my hallway as i came in the back door .  i was so scared and was afraid someone had broken in my home . 
in some ways that is a bit funny but it certainly can be a scary time to come home alone to an empty dark house . 
yes   _comma_    and i live out in the country so i wouldn t get a quick response time from emergency vehicles .  but   _comma_    luckily   _comma_    it turned out to be my shadow!
i hope you aren t still scared of your shadow?
there was a day that i was a bit short on cash on hand and i didn t give money to a homeless man .  i usually always do  _comma_   as i feel it s my part to help those in need  _comma_   as i am blessed .  i felt very bad that i didn t that day . 
i don t think you should feel too bad about missing one day!  it sounds like you re generous regularly .   i get it though . 
well  _comma_   homeless people aren t common in my area  _comma_   so that s why i felt a bit bad about it .  
it s hard to see people and not be able to help .   you seem really giving!
when my children were born _comma_  it was a rejoicing time for me .  i can t think of a time i felt more happiness . 
children are a beautiful thing for us parents .  what a great memory you have of that .  
yes   _comma_    i have two children and i feel so blessed to have them .  i lucked out and got a boy and girl   _comma_    both healthy   _comma_    smart and wonderful . 
thats perfect _comma_  a boy and a girl thats what most people want .  congrats .  
i used to work in a place where all my colleagues had different believes to myself .  i wanted to stay true to what i believed in _comma_  so had to walk away from conversations on many occasions . 
in what do you believe?
just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another  _comma_   just because of their religion or skin color  _comma_   or where they come from . 
that is great .  in what do your colleagues believe?
they believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven  _comma_   while the rest of us are left at the gate! that s one of their beliefs anyway .  i don t agree with that  _comma_   but chose to keep my mouth shut!
i recently bought a new car after not driving for several years and i was really scared to drive it _comma_  especially on the highway . 
what car did you buy?
just a honda civic .  people drive crazy around here .  i don t want to have another car accident like the last one . 
jeez .  where do you live? i dont remember any state ive been to with bad drivers . 
i recently joined a group to help me lose weight .  i have so much respect and admire everyone in that group so much . 
good luck! my sister in law has been with weight watchers for a while now .  she loves the camaraderie and how everyone encourages each other . 
it has really helped to have their support .  i am so grateful for them
you ll reach your goal .  you just have to make small adjustments which ll sustain you throughout your life .  how many meetings do you attend?
a few years ago i applied for us citizenship .  to succeed you have to pass a civics test .  i was so terribly nervous!
that test seems so hard .  i probably couldn t even pass it .  how did you do?
i passed! turns out you only had to answer three questions correctly .  but they have    to choose from so you have to study the lot!
i didn t know that .  congratulations .  that s so awesome . 
thank you .  my poor husband had to sit every single night and test me .  he s american and he didn t think he could pass!
i found some old christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them . 
that must have been nice .  i keep cards too . 
it was so nice .  i m terrible about throwing cards out .  i feel  _comma_   if someone s taken the time to write  _comma_   i should preserve it .  does that sound silly?
of course not .  there is so much paper in this house .  i keep cards  _comma_   photos  _comma_   school projects .  everything .  we arent here forever
that s very true .  my dad kept everything too .  when he passed we had quite a task sorting through things .  i think my brother s still at it!
i found lots of things to pass down when my grandmother passed .  i think they passed down their hoarding to us lol
i believe you are right! my family are going to go nuts when they see what they ve got to deal with _comma_  lol . 
lol .  me too!!
when i was entering the store it was really slippery . 
why was it slippery
it had been raining  _comma_  so i ran across the parking lot in to the store .  i slid about   feet . 
oh no _comma_  were you okay
i was fine _comma_  just felt like every one was looking at me . 
i am feeling a bit guilty about keeping a secret for my friend . 
oh no .  why are you keeping the secret?
i don t want to out her to her husband _comma_  usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend . 
oh it sounds like you are in a difficult situation .  i hope you can get out of the middle of it!
thanks _comma_  i am just going to avoid them until it plays iteself out . 
i feel kind of blue today _comma_  they announced the parts for the annual play . 
oh i am sorry .  did you get any part?
i did  _comma_   and it is a good one  _comma_   just not the one that i wanted .  i didn t want the lead or anything . 
i am glad you got a good part .  i am sure it is a let down to not get what you were hoping for though . 
it is  _comma_   my friend got it  _comma_   or i wouldn t think about it so much .  thanks for the kind words though . 
i m teaching my daughter how to drive  _comma_   and so far  _comma_   so good!
that is wonderful _comma_  i imagine she is very excited . 
she is!  at first   _comma_    though   _comma_    she was very nervous .   i told her we could start off slow   her dad lives   mile from me down a quiet road   _comma_    so we started driving back and forth between the two houses . 
okay i see well _comma_  take your time she will be getting her liscense soon
hopefully by the first of the year .   we ve worked up to driving to the dollar store   miles away .   she s still a little nervous but she s getting better and more confident the more we practice . 
she just needs to get her confidence and i am sure you are a great teacher . 
i do what i can where i can .   can t wait for our hard work to pay off and she gets her license!
it will definitely paid off and i am rooting for her . 
my house is a mess and i ve got people coming over later on this evening . 
that can be overwhelming .  are you going to be cleaning all day then?
i m going to try to .   if worst comes to worse  _comma_   i ll just toss everything in my back bedroom  _comma_   shiny up the floors and hope for the best!   chuckle 
i m sure you will get it done!
my brother and i recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything .  i m so lucky to have a brother i can rely on and who i know won t try and con me . 
thats neat .  do you guys make a lot of money?
we did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly .  he s such a neat brother in so many regards .  i always know he ll be there for anyone who needs help . 
i wish my siblings were like that .  we should be more supportive and close like that
we weren t always close .  when we were kids we were always fighting .  it wasn t until we got older that we got closer .  we re best of friends now . 
i am jealous lol
don t be! there are many _comma_  many types of relationships and i don t think ours is necessarily typical .  it s just the way it is :)
i will work on it with my family .  
my son was in advance placement and honors during high school .  he went to a prestigious college after _comma_  going for as an aerospace engineer .  he never ceases to astonish me with his intelligence and admire me with how hard he works to pursue his dreams . 
wow!  it sounds like your kid is quite smart and gifted!  you must be really proud of him!
i am quite proud  _comma_   thank you! i also have a teenage daughter that is very smart and an amazing artist  _comma_   (which i don t know where she gets that talent) .  they really impress me with amazing they are!
man _comma_  that is amazing that both your kids are so talented .   i hope my little ones are like that .   congrats on your great parenting!
going out today to learn a new route for my job and i m hoping that i don t get lost . 
are you able to learn the route first before you have to take it for your job or are they kind of just throwing you into it?
i got the assignment yesterday  _comma_   and i told myself that i d go drive around it today and tomorrow .   my boss is supposed to ride along with me the first week  _comma_   and then after that i ll be on my own . 
well hopefully you re able to familiarize yourself quickly .  good luck!
i was over here in the us when my grandma passed in scotland .  i was so upset   nobody could get hold of me to tell me and her funeral was over before i knew about it . 
thats sad .  have you been to scotand since?
only for funerals  _comma_   unfortunately .  both my parents have since died .  unpleasant fact of life  _comma_   i m afraid . 
im sorry to hear that .  were you born there?
yes i was .  i didn t come to the us until i was in my   s .  didn t expect my grandma to pass the minute i got here  _comma_   but she was     _comma_   so it shouldn t have been such a surprise!
  ! wow .  thats a full life!
she was as fit as a flea too .  she tripped and broke her hip and got a bad infection in the hospital .  that s what she died of!
wow .  she probably couldve kept going for years if it wasnt for that . 
i just bought an xbox! i ve never owned a gaming console before
excellent! are you enjoying it?
i am! i bought halo and am ready to ride . 
sick .  i hope it s as fun as it looks!
my father passed away   years ago _comma_  but my mother lives in my neighborhood now .  i m so thankful she lives close by and still here with us .  she s such a wonderful mother . 
i am glad that she is living close to you .  that must make you feel special .  my mom is dead so i understand how you feel . 
i m sorry to hear that  _comma_   i know it s so hard to lose a parent .  i think we take them for granted when we are younger  _comma_   but i am blessed she s still here . 
i am happy that your mom is still around .  cherish the days that you spend together . 
i am as happy as a clam right now .  my neighbors are away for the weekend!
are they typically bad or something?
the live upstairs and constantly thump around _comma_  screeching into their cellphones .  and then there s the video games . 
oh that makes sense _comma_  well enjoy the peace and quiet!
oh i am  _comma_   believe me i am .  the world seems like a calm  _comma_   serene place where everything is just right!
my friend from across the continent came over yesterday! i was so happy about it
thats awesome .  what did you guys do?
we ended up hanging out and recording some audio .  he is a voice actor
that sounds fun!
i was out for a walk one night in a suburb of boston when we heard the cries of a young animal .  it was a baby kitten  _comma_   with no collar  _comma_   in a window well . 
poor thing! what did you do?   did you take it home with you?
we actually did  _comma_   and ended up adopting him .  he was still so young he needed formula  _comma_   but now he is thriving!
eww _comma_   that is great you took such great care of him .   
i felt a need to help when the baby bird was by itself
that  s nice of you .   did you keep it as a pet
i did not _comma_  i was little but i think i put it back into a tree
cool .   some birds shouldn t be in captivity .   what kind of bird was it
waiting to see if i would graduate was pretty unnerving
that is a nerve racking experience .  but i m betting you did graduate and did just fine!
yep _comma_  had to take a class online over the summer but it worked out
congratulations! waiting for results can be very stressful   everything s out of your hands and all you can do is wait . 
i forgot my mother in law s birthday this year and can t look her in the eye!
i m sure she understands _comma_  just tell the truth!
i just feel so embarrassed   she never forgets my birthday .  and my husband was away and didn t remind me :( 
yeah  _comma_   i d be pretty scared too  _comma_   but it s better to be upfront about it to get it off your chest
you re right .  she s a very forgiving person and i ve never forgotten before .  it s on st .  paddy s day for heavens sake   how could i forget???
i was the only one wearing pajamas at this party _comma_  not my greatest moment
oh boy .  did you not get the memo that you were supposed to be wearing a dress?
i thought that it was a pajama party haha  _comma_   never worn a dress before  _comma_   maybe that s the secret
everyone looks good in a dress .  just make sure to shave first . 
i had some trippy nightmares as a kid _comma_  now i don t really have dreams
oh man _comma_  i did too .   i still do every once in a while but only when i m having trouble sleeping .   does one stand out from the rest that you remember vividly?
yeah  _comma_   it was like i was tied to a chair and a huge thing was staring at me  _comma_   pretty weird
creepy! i once had a dream of a lion laying at the end of my bad .  it was scary but also comforting .   i feel like i could ve touched it .  glad you re free of those dreams now . 
i didn t realize that stealing was bad until i realized how it made me feel afterwards
so you probably felt pretty guilty huh .  did you return what you stole?
no  _comma_   i was scared to get charged  _comma_   but i stopped after that
glad to hear you stopped with your wayward habits before the po po caught up with you!
i was at a meditation retreat last year for    days and i can say that i experienced a better feeling there than i could ever remembe
i ve always liked the idea of meditation _comma_  but i feel like it d be hard .  my mind is always racing!
yeah _comma_  thankfully there s an app for that   headspace (no i am not sponsored)
awesome _comma_  i ll check that out! i hear all sorts of great things about meditation . 
i am really looking forward to going away for the holidays . 
me too _comma_  do you have any special plans?
i want to go see the harry potter land at universal _comma_  the kids will love it . 
how fun! yes i am sure they will have  a great time!
they love the films  _comma_   plus getting to ride hogwarts express  _comma_   score!
i m really hoping my acceptance letter shows up in the mail soon . 
is it for college?
law school  _comma_   i m pretty sure i got in to my first choice  _comma_   but you never know . 
well good luck _comma_  i hope you get in!
thank you _comma_  fingers are crossed . 
i just ordered a new cookery book and am eagerly awaiting its arrival .  i want to delve in and try lots of new recipes!
i love cooking! what types of things do you like to cook?
i m vegetarian and cook all sorts of different cuisines   indian  _comma_   italian  _comma_   american .  the only cuisine i m not good at is chinese .  how about you?
i am also a vegetarian and i love cooking italian food . 
have you heard of mark bittman s book how to cook everything vegetarian? that s the book i m waiting impatiently for!
i witnessed the most epic bottle flip in the history of bottle flips at my school
those are so much fun .  was everyone hype?
yee yee _comma_  it landed on this little ledge that was super high up . 
tight .  probably wont be able to do that again!
my little grandson just came home from the hospital .  he was born premature and weighted under   pounds . 
oh my gosh _comma_  so tiny .  i m hoping since he was released from the hospital he is doing well now?
he is doing well _comma_  thank you .  and we are so thankful everything is ok .  it was touch and go for awhile
i can imagine .  i m glad to hear he s better! life is such a gift . 
i love my girlfriend .  she would never cheat on me
that is really nice that you guys have that trust . 
i hope to make her my wife some day!
that is an awesome goal! good luck!
my sister spilled some milk on me .  it set me off!
i hope it didn t mess up your clothes .  i m sure it was a mistake . 
it was indeed a mistake .  my clothes are fine now . 
i m glad it didn t mess anything up and that your relationship with your sister is still in tact . 
i recently did not pay my rent .  my land lord has been terrible at providing services
oh no .  i rent also so i know your pain .  my last landlord was awful .   how did your landlord react?
he decided to start caring and doing his part . 
oh good _comma_  glad he did that instead of just coming down on your for not paying .   glad it worked out for you . 
i m thankful that i was able to repair my tire before it went flat on my car
lucky you did that in time!
right  _comma_   i caught it just as it happened and brought it to the shop  _comma_   didn t cost as much as i thought it would either . 
sounds like it worked out great for you!
i love my friend .  she just drove me to class
wow! you should do something back for her!
i think i am getting her a gift soon!
nice _comma_  i am jealous of your friendship!
i stole from my friends when i was a child .  i feel terrible about it now
was it something important that you took ?
it was some pokemon cards!
i see _comma_  did they ever find out it was you ?
my father almost passed away last year .  it was very tough on everyone
that is awful _comma_  i am sorry to hear that .   is he doing better now?
yes _comma_  he has made a full recovery! it s been a journey
i m so glad he is better .   is the whole family doing alright?  i know that can be really hard on people . 
i remember when i was a young one .  i loved life . 
life was easier back then _comma_  hopefully you still love life?
i do _comma_  but maybe not with he same flare as before
nostalgia can stir emotions .  you ll find something to love about life again . 
i helped find my friend s cats .  she s glad they re back now
oh _comma_  no!  what happened?  did she just get loose?  
yes they both just wandered off when the door was open!
thankfully  _comma_   they are both okay .   dogs or cars  _comma_   or anything for that matter could get them!
what?
i recently got an a on my paper .  i feel great . 
congrats! i bet that feels great!
i went swimming recently .  i lost my trunks walking out of the pool . 
that is embarrassing .  i would hate to have that happen . 
yeah _comma_  we all have a good laugh about it now
that is the best way to handle those situations . 
drinking a gallon of milk in a day wasn t a good idea
ouch! i can relate .  what made you decide to drink a whole gallon in a day?
i wanted to see how hard it would be _comma_  turns out my stomach was just big enough
haha! i hope you experience no seriously ill effects!
my friend slept with a girl i like .  i feel horrible now
sheesh that is brutal _comma_  did you smack him?
no _comma_  but i don t think he is my friend any more
i don t blame you _comma_  that is low . 
i don t like working with managers that try to micro manage me
me neither _comma_  i hate it when they just wont leave you alone
right _comma_  it kind of feels like they re insecure with their abilities while trying to make me feel bad at the same time
yes! i feel the same
teeth are weird _comma_  but also take a lot of upkeep which is sometimes irritating
always try to brush your teeth at least twice a day _comma_  it helps
yeah that s what my dentist says _comma_  i ll try
if you don t take care of your teeth then you will have a bad time later in life
i wake up with chills sometimes for no reason
that is bizarre _comma_  have you had this seen about?
i think it s from dreams that i m not able to recall
that is odd _comma_  are you afraid when you wake up?
i wasn t able to reach my goals in the gym a couple days ago _comma_  and it helped me realize where i m slacking off in other areas
you sound a lot like my husband .  he is really into going to the gym .  life isnt right if he doesnt get gym time . 
yeah  _comma_   it s fun to see how much you can conquer yourself  _comma_   and it s nice to be able to see how you re changing
i agree .  its pretty cool to see the changes .  i never really got into going to the gym though .  
i recently went skydiving .  it was a thrilling rush
i have been skydiving _comma_  too! it was a fun experience . 
it was excellent .  i feel so alive!
i lost my hearing for a few hours after though _comma_  but other than that it was a wonderful experience . 
i think i will have success in my life .  i love life these days!
that is great _comma_  did something recently happen?
i recently finished a new album i have been working on!
awesome! what type of music?
i m excited to think of all the possibilities that are available to me at the moment
what possibilities do you speak of?
being able to learn basically anything with the internet for one
that sounds pretty exciting . 
i like meditating because it puts things into perspective in a way that i don t usually expect
i ve never been much for meditating .  i m glad you enjoy it . 
for sure _comma_  my mind is pretty energetic
what got you into meditation?
i ve been processing what being lonely feels like _comma_  because i want to be able to have fun by myself sometimes
i think that s a good idea so you aren t always dependent on others to have fun and just enjoy time to yourself . 
true   _comma_    and i ve felt that way before   _comma_    but sometimes like a wave of those kinds of feelings hits like i m not worthy enough and stuff like that   _comma_    but it s all good
meditation on goals and positive ideas during some of that alone time can be so uplifting and refocuses you . 
i m trying to get over my need to control things _comma_  and i find if i just let things happen it feels like a weights been pulled off my shoulders
i used to struggle with the same problem _comma_  it can be overwhelming
right _comma_  but things always seem to turn out for the best anyway
i agree!!
i grew up pretty skinny and now that i ve grown some muscle i feel a lot more comfortable in my skin
grats .   how long have you been working out for?
around   months _comma_  been pretty slow to make progress but overall it s been solid
keep your diet clean and you ll keep improving . 
i am going to go camping tomorrow! the back s already packed
that sounds nice .  hopefully it isn t too hot for you . 
i hope not .  i m in florida so it might get bad
are you going to be sleeping in a tent?
my old house burned down  _comma_   and i went to check it out  _comma_   was surreal taking a look around the place
that s just so sad .  house fires are terrifying to me . 
yeah  _comma_   it was built a long time ago  _comma_   some kind of electrical fire
the wiring was probably old and not up to code anymore . 
i was truly surprised when i notice my tire got hit by a rock _comma_  thought i wouldn t make it to the tire place in time
did it go flat?
it did not  _comma_   got it replaced when i dropped it off  _comma_   pretty lucky
that is very fortunate!
there was a cat who had string stuck around it so i had to help
that is really nice of you!  is the cat ok now?
yeah _comma_  everything turned out fine in the end
that s good .   if not for you _comma_  who knows what could have happened .   you must be a very caring individual . 
i feel like deepening my connection to god is the most important thing in my life
i think that is a lovely thing
it s like if i don t get that sorted out i won t be able to live a fulfilling life
if its important _comma_  you will figure it out
when i can t take a breather in the day i feel suffocated
yea _comma_  its a good idea to take time for yourself when you can
right _comma_  it s like i can t focus or relax
i think relaxing is very important
when i was in elementary school i was envious of the kids who were popular!
yeah as a child it s hard to see other kids with a bunch of friends when you don t have that many . 
yeah _comma_  i just had trouble socializing is all
well _comma_  i hope you got over that issue and ended up making lots of friends yourself . 
when i do things that are challenging i feel more self reliant .  i recently tried taking an ice bath
oh man! thats impressive _comma_  those baths are rough . 
yeah  _comma_   my bath wasn t deep enough  _comma_   so i didn t get covered all the way!
that s good .  but still! you must be pretty tough!
i m eating a lot of food to make sure i can lift more weight in the gym next time!
are you taking protein?
i m taking everything    _comma_     honey    _comma_     raw garlic    _comma_     yogurt    _comma_     everything!
that is good _comma_  hopefully it helps!
i don t like scammy sales people _comma_  nothing good comes from it
i agree _comma_  were you recently screwed by one?
yeah _comma_  it s like they live to manipulate people for money
yep its disgusting
i went to lunch the other day with my kids .  my daughter needed help opening her dipping sauce and of course i did . 
that is sweet of you _comma_  kids are cute
they are but when i finally got it open it sprayed me from my waste all the way to my hair! 
oh that is not good _comma_  i hope you were able to clean it up easily . 
listening to old artists like they might be giants is my jam
wow i haven t thought of them in years .   sometimes it is good to have bands you can always go back to
haha _comma_  i didn t grow up with them but it s like discovering a gold mine that no one else seems to listen to
true .   i have favorite bands to that i consider to be musical comfort food
getting my driver s license was a freeing experience
nice! are you getting a car soon too?
yeah  _comma_   that was a while ago  _comma_   cars are great in a lot of situationsz!
definitely _comma_  especially when you get really hungry at night .  i love a good drive thru
i ve had the worst week _comma_  someone stole my credit card information . 
that is awful .  i ve had it happen to me once before . 
yes it s been hell _comma_  they charged over    thousand dollars on it .  i hope my identity is fine besides the card . 
i sure hope so _comma_  too! it is a lot of work to get it sorted out .  
i was pretty disillusioned when i found out door to door sales wasn t a fun time
yeah .  that seems like a hard gig     _comma_      especially in today s day and age     _comma_      where everyone s so wary     _comma_      and especially since there s not often people at home during the day .  you have to have good people skills to do that job     _comma_      though .  so     _comma_      you at least probably have that going for you . 
i realized that it was unethical in the end!
ah .  yeah _comma_  i m sorry you had to run into that kind of problem .  it s hard doing a job you don t agree with the ethics of .  there s really no way to fake it sometimes .  but at least you were able to realize that and stand by your morals . 
ugh  _comma_   i m so annoyed! my husband went out again with his friends  _comma_   third time this week . 
is he going out drinking?
yes _comma_  i m exhausted .  my daughter is teething so she hasn t been sleeping well . 
that is such a tough time _comma_  my son is teething as well
seeing people taken advantage of by fake religious services is something i find the most vile .  it makes them believe that they re doing the right thing _comma_  but the person taking advantage of them knows what s really up .  what do you know about that?
well i am not a religious person but i will have to say it urks me when i am surronded my religious people that is trying to push their belief on me .  then seeing them feel people heads with stuff that they can not prove is there irritates me also
exactly  _comma_   i feel that getting people to believe irrational things is the same as giving them a brain virus  _comma_   it ll slowly erode their ability to think rationally . 
lol .  exactly how i feel
i have a presentation for work on monday _comma_  i m a little nervous . 
oh _comma_  thats not unusual .  you must try to relax .  is it an important presentation?
kind of _comma_  but i have prepared a lot so i m sure it ll go good! i work in the human resource department for a big company and we are trying to find new ways to retain good employes . 
i see _comma_  i hope it goes well for you .  remember to breathe! 
i had to leave my key in my car for the mechanic and i was left wondering if someone might find it
that is a scary situation .  people do not care anymore . 
right _comma_  there s too many people to say that it wouldn t happen
you are so right! 
this week was the last one for this semester of my college courses
that is awesome _comma_  what degree are you working towards?
healthcare administration  _comma_   only   months left! i get so antsy waiting to see the final grades  _comma_   it drives me crazy 
i can imagine _comma_  waiting sucks!
i got woken up by my roommate and i swear his voice is the last thing you want to hear in the middle of the night _comma_  sent the fear of god through my veins
that s kind of odd .  i probably would have tried to take a swing just out of pure instinct .  what was the reason they wanted to wake you up?
i don t know  _comma_   i didn t answer  _comma_   pretended i was asleep
hahaha .  that s kind of goofy in a way .  yeah _comma_  sometimes nothing good can come of people trying to get your attention randomly in the middle of the night .  that s probably the wisest choice .  i probably wouldn t be able to act that good enough to pull it off . 
i almost got caught stealing _comma_  i felt pretty bad
ouch!  what did you take?
a computer keyboard from my school
was it an awesome keyboard worth getting in trouble for?
i m    weeks pregnant _comma_  could have my baby any day now!
congrats! thats so exciting do you fel ok?
yes  _comma_   a bit nervous because my first birth was hard  _comma_   but i know i m ready and have everything we need for the baby! 
yay! good job! he she is going to be beautiful
christmas was the best time of year back in the day!
i still think it is _comma_  i always get so excited
yeah _comma_  it s like there s nothing to worry about
yep thats one of the things that make it so nice
some random dude walked into my room while i was laying down _comma_  couldn t have been more weird
oh wow that is weird .  did you say anything to him?
i was like what the hell _comma_  and then he said sorry and walked out
yeesh _comma_  how awkward is that . 
someone hit my car at walmart today and drove off!
were you able to take the plate id?
no _comma_  i didn t see it someone reported it to customer service and they paged me .  i wish they would have left a note! people have so decency sometimes!
i understand .  sorry to hear about that . 
i saw my favourite candy at the store today! was so excited _comma_  hadn t seen it in a while . 
oh nice .  what kind of candy was it?
this sour s ghetti candy by haribro .  i use to eat this all the time as a child . 
oh yeah i think i have tried that one! i love anything by haribro! 
my daughter has been sick for months but she is finally starting to get better!
glad to hear it .  i hate hearing about children having tragic childhoods and not being able to just simply be a kid .  but at least she ll have a good perspective and appreciate life more . 
thank you _comma_  defenitly! she is still young and most likely won t remember this either! 
even if she does    _comma_     it will help make her a well rounded    _comma_     relatable person .  usually these things help ground kids and give them character .  but maybe you re right    _comma_     if she moves on from it quickly    _comma_     that s great too!
my friend showed me his minecraft world and it was amazing! looked like he spent days on it
what had he made in the world?
he had created one giant hole and filled it up with water _comma_  super cool
that s super cool _comma_  i played a few years back but eventually quit . 
i had to cancel our family vacation coming up next month . 
i am really sorry to hear that .   i hope everything is alright . 
yes _comma_  his work told him he couldn t go after they already approved the time off .  guess next month is going to be busy at his work :(
well  _comma_   that is just terrible .   i hate it when companies jerk you around like that .   i hope you will be able to reschedule it  _comma_   although i know that wouldn t make up for the frustration . 
life is good _comma_  it s the gift that keeps on giving
that is a great way to look at it
glad you think so as well!
yeah more people should look at life like you do
i saw a huge cockroach outside my house today!

 no    _comma_    i am ok    _comma_    really  .  
 come on man ! i even got dope and acid ! try some ! 
 do you really have all of these drugs ? where do you get them from ? 
 i got my connections ! just tell me what you want and i ’ ll even give you one ounce for free  .  
 sounds good ! let ’ s see   _comma_   i want  .

 i want you to put your hands behind your head ! you are under arrest ! 
the taxi drivers are on strike again  .  
 what for ? 
 they want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline  .  
 it is really a hot potato  .  
we ve managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about    per cent in the last two years  .  
 that s excellent  .  how have you managed that ? 
 mainly because we ve invested in a heat recovery system  .  
 what does that mean exactly ? 
 well   _comma_   we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers  .  
 what other sources of energy do you use ? 
 we don t use any fossil fuels  .  most of our power comes from hydro electric plants  .  we re hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future   perhaps even wind power  .  
believe it or not   _comma_   tea is the most popular beverage in the world after water  .  
 well   _comma_   people from asia to europe all enjoy tea  .  
 right  .  and china is the homeland of tea  .  
 yes   _comma_   chinese people love drinking tea so much  .  some even claim they can t live without tea  .  
 do you know there are several catagories of chinese tea ? 
 yes    _comma_    i believe there are green teas    _comma_    black teas and scented teas  .  any others ? 
 well   _comma_   have you ever heard of oulong tea and compressed tea ? 
 oh   _comma_   yeah  .  oulong tea is good for one s health  .  isn t it ?

 i ’ m afraid i ’ m a poor talker  .  i ’ m not comfortable talking with the people whom i have just met for the first time  .  that is not very good for business   _comma_   so i have been studying public speaking  .  
 are you more of a leader or a follower ? 
 i don ’ t try to lead people  .  i ’ d rather cooperate with everybody   _comma_   and get the job done by working together  .  
 do you think you can make yourself easily understood in english ? 
 yes   _comma_   in most circumstances  .  
 are you available for travel ? 
 yes    _comma_    i like travelling  .  i am young    _comma_    and unmarried  .  it ’ s no problem for me to travel frequently  .  
how long will it take us to drive to london ? 
 i think it ’ s a distance of     kilometers from here to london   _comma_   so it should be a two hour drive on the motorway  .  
 that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam  .  it could take three hours  .  
 you ’ re right  .  we will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey   _comma_   because we will be in built up areas  .  
 so   _comma_   shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ? 
 ok  .  you haven ’ t seen my company car   _comma_   have you ? 
 no  .  let me take a look  .  it ’ s longer than my car  .  
 i think it ’ s over five meters long  .  i can ’ t remember exactly  .  it has a maximum speed of over     kilometers an hour  .  
 wow ! that ’ s fast ! i don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway  .  
 we can ’ t  .  if we went that fast   _comma_   we would break the speed limit  .  
so how did i do on my driving test ? 
 do you want the truth ? 
 of course   _comma_   i do  .  
 well   _comma_   you really didn t do all that well  .  
 how bad did i do ? 
 to be completely honest   _comma_   you failed your test  .  
 how ? 
 there were a number of reasons  .  
 what were they ? 
 basically   _comma_   you just can t drive  .

 i did   _comma_   but he wasn t able to either  .

 yes   _comma_   i have been working in the public relations section of a company in the past two years  .  i plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers  .  sometimes i have to do the work of a specialist when there ’ s something urgent  .  
 do you have any practical experience as a secretary ? 
 yes   _comma_   sir  .  i acted as a secretary in an insurance company  .  
 would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ? 
 well         _comma_         to begin with         _comma_         i would say she needs to be diligent         _comma_         and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative  .  finally         _comma_         she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing         _comma_         summary writing         _comma_         keep minutes at meetings         _comma_         and so on  .  most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average  .  
 have you had any experience with computer ? 
 yes    _comma_    i studied in a computer training program    _comma_    and can process data through the computer  .  
 that s fine  .  what about operating the fax and duplicator ? 
 i can handle them without any trouble 
 what have you learned from jobs you have held ? 
 above all   _comma_   i have learned that what is good for the company is good for me  .  so i follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed  .  
 very good  .  
hi   _comma_   dan  .  what s new ? 
 where have you been ? i ve been trying to get in touch with you for two days  .  
 i went to salt lake city on business  .  what s up ? 
 i got fired  .  
 how come ? last time i saw you  .  you told me it was a good job   _comma_   and you d like to take it as a career  .  that was only one month ago  .  why this sudden change ? 
 it s a long story  .  in a word    _comma_    i didn t do a good job of it  .  i messed up a business deal    _comma_    a deal that would have made ten million dollars and i messed it up  .  
 what are you going to do now ? 
 i am trying to find a job asap  .  lily doesn t know yet  .  i didn t tell her  .  i spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office   _comma_   and she thought i went to work as usual  .  
 that s not the way to solve the problem  .  did you look in the classified advertisements column ? 
 yes   _comma_   i did  .  but i wasn t qualified for most of the jobs that i was interested in  .  
 listen  .  i will see what i can do   _comma_   ok ? you go home and tell lily about this problem you have now  .  she is your wife and i am sure she will understand  .  
 i just don t know how to bring it up  .  well   _comma_   all right  .  she has the right to know anyways  .  
have you ever gotten a parking ticket ? 
 i ve never gotten one  .  have you ? 
 i got a ticket yesterday  .  
 really ? what did you get one for ? 
 i parked in the red zone  .  
 why did you do that ? 
 i needed to get something really quick  .  
 where did you park at ? 
 at my apartment building  .

 i ’ m having a problem  .  
 what problem are you having ? 
 there have been charges made on my debit card that i didn ’ t make  .  
 do you have the statement for your card ? 
 here it is  .  
 what are the charges you ’ re referring to ? 
 the last four charges on the page  .  
 i ’ m afraid we ’ re going to have to investigate these charges  .  
 how long will an investigation take ? 
 i honestly don ’ t know   _comma_   but we will freeze payment on these charges  .  
 that sounds absolutely fantastic  .  
good afternoon  .  can i be of service ? 
 i don t know  .  can i purchase treasury certificates here at this counter ? 
 yes    _comma_    of course  .  we have treasury notes with two    _comma_    three and five year terms available  .  
 two years is fine    _comma_    with a value of     _comma_       rib  .  
 ok    _comma_    could i take a look at some id please    _comma_    like a passport ? 
 here you go  .  by the way   _comma_   is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ? 
 no   _comma_   i m afraid that isn t possible  .  you must wait until maturity before you cash them  .  
hey  .  why did you take that money ? you are such a cheater ! i should send you to jail ! 
 i am not cheating  .  when you pass go    _comma_    you collect          _comma_    everyone knows that ! 
 well you can ’ t just take the money  .  you have to ask the bank for money  .  and i ’ m the banker  .  
 banker ? 
 yes  .  
 can i have my       please ? 
 sure  .  here you are     _comma_               _comma_     thank you     _comma_     please come again ! now it ’ s my turn to roll the dice  .  
hi   _comma_   is this professor clark ’ s office ? 
 this is professor clark speaking  .  
 hi   _comma_   this is kalina from your morning literature class  .  
 yes   _comma_   what can i do for you ? 
 i had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ’ t be able to come to school today  .  
 my goodness ! are you ok ? 
 i broke my leg   _comma_   but it is healing  .  
 how long will you be out of class ? 
 i should be able to return by next monday  .  
 fine  .  well   _comma_   thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent  .  i hope you feel better soon  .  
good afternoon ! did you call for a plumber ? 
 yes     _comma_     yes i did  .  please come in ! i ’ m so glad you came ! this old house is falling apart ! come on into the bathroom  .  see     _comma_     here     _comma_     there ’ s water leaking everywhere ! 
 i see  .  let me have a look  .  it seems that your toilet is clogged    _comma_    and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush  .  let me just get my plunger  .  no    _comma_    that ’ s not working either  .  i suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage  .  that ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow  .  
 oh   _comma_   that must be because of my four year old daughter  .  she is always flushing things down the toilet  .  you know how kids are  .  
 yeah      _comma_      i have a little one myself  .  anyway      _comma_      these water pipes are really rusty      _comma_      so they also should be changed  .  thatcould be causing water to not drain completely      _comma_      that might lead to more problems in the future  .  i would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly  .  i could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent  .  
 that would be great ! is it expensive ? 
 let ’ s see  .  i would say about eight hundred dollars  .  
listen    _comma_    karen    _comma_    i need your help  .  i don t know anyone here yet  .  
 i m glad to help you  .  what s wrong ? 
 my mother in law just went into the hospital in l . a . hank and i will be flying there tonight  .  
 i m sorry to hear it  .  what s wrong with her ? 
 doctors aren t sure yet . but the real problem is suzy  .  she has a bad cold   _comma_   and we don t want to take her with us  .  but we don t know who can stay with her  .  
 you need a babysitter  .  
 yes     _comma_     i d ask jill     _comma_     the girl i ve had before     _comma_     but i need someone overnight . maybe even for two nights  .  
 i could have suzy stay at my place  .  
 i don t want to do that to you   _comma_   karen  .  
 why not ? 
 your own kids would get suzy s cold  .  i think it would be better to have a good babysitter here  .  but i don t know who to ask  .  i need someone more mature than jill  .  it might even be for two or three days  .  
 i know who we can ask  .  there is a girl i know     _comma_     sara ralston . she is        _comma_     and she will usually take this kind of job  .  i know her from my church     _comma_     and i trust her completely  .  
 i d like to talk with her . this is short notice   _comma_   i know  .  but hank and i are leaving tonight  .  
 i ll get you her number  .  i hope she can do it  .  she is very responsible  .  
 i m glad you know someone  .  i knew you would be the best person to ask about this  .  i don t want to insult jill or her mother  .  i think jill maybe could do it . but i d rather have someone a little older  .  
 i ll go home and get sara s number  .  i ll call her first myself  .  
 great  .  then call me and let me know if she s free  .  
good evening  .  what ll you have ? 
 i d like a beer  .  what kind of beer do you have ? 
 draft beer and cans beer  .  which do you prefer ? 
 a draft beer please  .  
 ok  .  here you are  .  
 could i have some fruit ? 
 of course  .  wait for a moment   _comma_   please  .  
hello    _comma_    mr  .  black    _comma_    how are you ? 
 fine    _comma_    thank you    _comma_    and how are you ? 
 very well    _comma_    thank you  .  it s nice to meet you again  .  i am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport    _comma_    as i was busy yesterday  .  i do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from new york  .  
 yes   _comma_   a very pleasant journey indeed  .  thank you  .  
 how are you getting along with your business ? 
 not bad  .  the fur market is not very brisk lately   _comma_   but the selling season is advancing near  .  i hope there will be more buyers in the market this year  .  
 i hope we can do more business together  .  though we are satisfied with our past trade record      _comma_      there are still possibilities for more business  .  in the meantime      _comma_      let s discuss other spheres of cooperation      _comma_      such as investment      _comma_      technology transfer and technical assistance  .  
by the way miss   _comma_   where is the toilet ? 
 toilets are in the rear   _comma_   i am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment  .  
 what ? oh    _comma_    what we live ! thank you very much for your help    _comma_    miss  .  
 you are welcome  .  
excuse me   _comma_   could you tell me which line i ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ? 
 you can buy the bubble wrap here   _comma_   but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage  .  
 that ’ s a really long line  .  how long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ? 
 it takes about   minutes per person   _comma_   so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait  .  
 can i buy stamps here ? 
 sure  .  how many would you like ? 
 i need    for my christmas cards  .  
 are you sending them abroad ? 
 twenty of them are going abroad to china and america  .  
 do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do   _comma_   those are less expensive  .  
 no  .  
 ok   _comma_   here you go  .  that will be    pounds and seventy two pence  .  
 and the bubble wrap ? 
 that ’ s another quid  .  
 thanks a lot  .  you ’ ve been very helpful  .  
good evening   _comma_   saliva  .  what s that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? what are you doing now ? 
 i am cooking now ! 
 are you good at cooking ? 
 i have studied its skills recently at a training school  .  i plan to run a restaurant   _comma_   so i have to practise cooking ! 
 it is a good idea  .  what dish are you cooking now ? ! 
 i am steaming fish in a pressure cooker  .  have you ever tried steamed fish ? 
 yes   _comma_   i have  .  but the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious  .  the fish is not well done and too salty  .  
 that s the case  .  i think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much  .  
 i have the same idea as yours  .  
 it s ok  .  please have a taste of it  .  
 thank you  .  oh   _comma_   it s very delicious  .  
 thank you for your praise  .  
 besides steamed fish   _comma_   what else are you good at cooking ? 
 i am good at stewing beef with potato    _comma_    frying chicken    _comma_    hot and sour soup etc  .  
 so many dishes  .  next friday week is my birthday  .  i would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party   _comma_   ok ? 
 why not ? it is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking  .  
 thanks a lot  .  
 it s my pleasure  .  
room service . what can i do for you ? 
 this is room       .  where is my laundry ? you promised to send to me this morning  .  
 well     _comma_     let me check for you  .  i am sorry     _comma_     sir  .  they mistook your order as a normal one . actualty it s an express laundry     _comma_     is that right ? 
 yes   _comma_   i ordered the express service  .  
 sir   _comma_   we are terribly sorry for that . we will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room   hours later  .  is that all right ? 
 that s fine  .  
i d like you to do me a favor  .  
 what is it ? 
 can you mail this at the post office for me ? i have to go to the doctor for an appointment and i don t have enough time to go to the post office  .  
 sure  .  and i d like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor s  .  
excuse me   _comma_   may i help you ? 
 would you please fill some gas for me ? 
 sure  .  which kind of gas do you want ? 
 unleaded   _comma_   please  .  
 ok  .  
i ll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports  .  
 it can be solved by drawing a draft on us at    days sight  .  
 what about a draft at     days sight ? 
 all right  .  but we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us  .  
 a bank s acceptance will add to the costs of our imports  .  you can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due  .  
 then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank  .  you know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible  .  
 i hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries  .  
 so do i  .  
there s a new girl in school   _comma_   have you seen her yet ? 
 i haven t seen her yet  .  
 i think that she is very pretty  .  
 tell me how she looks  .  
 she s kind of short  .  
 what height is she ? 
 she s probably about five feet  .  
 that s nice   _comma_   but tell me what she looks like  .  
 the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes  .  
 i think i might ve bumped into her before  .  
 are you telling me that you ve seen her before ? 
 i believe so  .  
take a seat inside and see what you think . so you will take the porsche then   _comma_   sir ? 
 yes   _comma_   and i want to buy the insurance too  .  i think it s necessary  .  
 you re smart to buy it  .  at    dollars for three days   _comma_   it is a good deal  .  
 can i return the car in san francisco ? 
 san francisco ? no   _comma_   sir . we only have this office here  .  you will have to return it here  .  
 really ? i heard in america you can return rental cars in different cities  .  
 no    _comma_    sir  .  that s only with the very big companies  .  i m sorry    _comma_    but this car must be returned to this lot  .  
 well   _comma_   i guess i will have to drive back down then  .  hmm  .  i didn t think of that  .  
 do you still want the car   _comma_   sir ? 
 yes  .  it will be fun  .  driving back down the coast  .  my girlfriend will like it  .  
 it s a beautiful drive  .  
 where are the keys ? 
 just a moment   _comma_   sir  .  we have to finish filling out the forms  .  
gary  .  could you type up this report for me ? i have to take off early this afternoon  .  
 sure  .  just leave it to me  .  i ll finish it  .  
look at the show on tv  .  i am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant  .  i really want to eat at that restaurant  .  i am a seafood lover  .  
 speaking of seafood   _comma_   my mouth is watering  .  let s go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood  .  
 sound great  .  let s go ! 
 look at the crystal clear fridge  .  you can see so many kinds of seafood in it  .  they all look very fresh and delicious  .  
 true  .  i would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head  .  
 you sound like a seafood expert  .  i would like to have some stir fried squids and steamed shrimps  .  
 you are not too bad as well  .  i also want to have a steamed lobster  .  it is really taste like heaven  .  
 let s go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food  .  
 wait  .  let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first  .  
 ok  .  i will wait for you inside the restaurant 
 do you think we should try some deep fried oysters ? 
where do you want to go ? 
 i m going to the hospital  .  
 get in  .  i ll take you  .  
 about how much will it cost ? 
 it will cost you       .  
 by the way   _comma_   what s the time ? 
 you can see the time on the meter  .  i have radio time   _comma_   you know  .  
 it s a quarter to     .  could you please drive a little faster ? 
 certainly  .  
you re made a good choice  .  this china tea set is unusual  .  
 where was it from ? 
 it was made in jingdezhen  .  
 jingdezhen ? isn t it called   the capital of porcelain   ? 
 you are right  .  
 this is the very thing i ve been dreaming of  .  
 it is the best quality porcelain the famous egg shell china  .  
 it must be most precious  .  
 but it is really worth the price  .  
hello    _comma_    miao li    _comma_    where are you going ? 
 hello   _comma_   i am going to the store to buy some fruit  .  
 oh   _comma_   would you do me a favor ? 
 yes ? 
 please mail this letter for me on your way to the store  .  
 sure  .  do you want it to be registered ? 
 yes   _comma_   i think so  .  there are some pictures in it  .  it would be a great pity if they were lost  .  
 yes   _comma_   i will be glad to mail your letter  .  
 thanks  .  
 you are welcome  .  
i have a cell phone in my car  .  now it s probably on the floor on the passenger side . why don t you get it for me   _comma_   and then i can call the police ? 
 alright  .  
 it doesn t work  .  it looks like it s broken  .  i need to get to a hospital  .  you should drive me there  .  
 oh   _comma_   yeah ? it s better if we make a police report first  .  then you can go to the hospital  .  
 damn it ! i m injured here  .  we could wait all day for the police  .  
 well   _comma_   you ll just have to wait  .  i m not going to move my car until the police arrive  .  i ll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone  .  don t worry  .  you ll get to the hospital in time  .  
 it really hurts  .  
 yes    _comma_    maybe it does . but if you re going to drive like you did just now    _comma_    you will have to get used to a little physical pain  .  you know what i mean ? 
 to hell with you  .  the accident was your fault  .  
 i m afraid it wasn t  .  and when the police get here   _comma_   you will also see that it wasn t  .  but enough of this bickering  .  i m going to go find a phone . don   t move that arm while i m gone  .  alright ? 
 to hell with you  .  
good morning  .  vane theater   _comma_   at your service  .  
 hello  .  i m thinking about watching a chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl  .  what s on this weekend ? 
 well    _comma_    there will be charity performance on saturday night  .  and also    _comma_    there will be a solo concert by an opera star on sunday night  .  
 it s a good thing that i have choices here  .  can you tell me about the one on saturday ? 
 sure  .  it s to raise money for the homeless  .  
 what about the performance itself ? 
 oh   _comma_   it s a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven  .  
 wow   _comma_   a story about the clever monkey king  .  it s a classic and children s favorite  .  
 it surely is  .  and the cast is really the best  .  
 wonderful ! how much is the ticket ? 
 the price varies according to the seats  .      for the front    _comma_        for the middle    _comma_    and    for the back  .  
all right  .  i want to bring everybody back on this subject  .  when can we start working on this ? 
 well   _comma_   we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at  :    .  
 i tell you what    _comma_     :   is not available for me    _comma_    but you can get started and i ll come by at around  :   
 that s fine with me  .  how much time are we going to have to work on this ? 
 perhaps one year   _comma_   i m not sure  .  
what dressing would you like on the salad ? 
 french dressing   _comma_   please  .  
 i beg your pardon ? 
 oh   _comma_   french dressing  .  
 sorry   _comma_   it s not available now . anything else ? 
 we still prefer french dressing  .  
could i have some fish ? 
 certainly  .  and what vegetables would you like ? 
 oh    _comma_    spinach    _comma_    i think  .  
 fine   _comma_   and what about something to drink ? 
 just a beer   _comma_   please  .  
 good  .  thank you . sir  .  
 would you like to have some more beer ? 
 no    _comma_    thanks  .  i   ve had enough  .  i ll have my bill    _comma_    please  .  
 of course  .  please wait a moment  .  i ll go and get it  .  
 thank you  .  
hi   _comma_   george  .  i m going to have a job interview next week  .  could you give me some advice ? 
 sure  .  first of all    _comma_    it ’ s very important for you not to be late  .  job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time    _comma_    only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic  .  
 yeah   _comma_   that s very important  .  
 so you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time   _comma_   look around to see what the employees are wearing  .  so the next day you will arrive early for the appointment  .  
 i ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer  .  
 that ’ s right  .  you need to create a good image in a limited time   _comma_   usually about    to    minutes  .  
 it ’ s always easier to say something than to do it  .  
 it ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression  .  for example   _comma_   you should take care to appear well groomed and modestly dressed  .  avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style  .  this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications  .  
 but i love wearing t shirts and jeans  .  
 i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview  .  informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job   _comma_   or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes  .  
 it ’ s a pity that i cannot afford more expensive clothes  .  
 you misunderstood me  .  clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job   _comma_   or that you are snobbish or frivolous  .  
 i know what you mean  .  i ought to wear right clothes at the right time  .  
 you got it  .  only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement  .  
 it seems that   clothes make the man    .  
 it may not be true   _comma_   but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior  .  
the boss announces the pay raise today   _comma_   right ? how much do you think we ll get ? 
 no idea  .  your guess is as good as mine  .  
 it better be more than last year  .  
 well   _comma_   anything is better than nothing  .  wait and see  .  
i m sorry   _comma_   our appointment has to be changed  .  
 what a pity ! 
 if you don t mind   _comma_   may we put it off to the next day ? 
 that s ok  .  
good day ! welcome to lincoln bank   _comma_   how may we assist you ? 
 hello  .  i need to find out if a receipt of proceeds has arrived  .  i m from felix wasserman associates  .  
 thanks  .  have you got the l   c number ? 
 it s nx              .  
 hang on a tick and i ll check for you  .  i m sorry ; we have no record of that arriving  .

tell me about yourself  .  
 i was born and raised in beijing  .  i attended peking university and received my bachelor s degree in economics  .  i have worked for   years as a financial consultant in beijing for china pacific insurance co  .  ltd  .  
 what type of position are you looking for ? 
 i m looking for a position in which i can utilize my experience  .  
 are you interested in a full time or part time position ? 
 i am more interested in a full time position  .  however   _comma_   i would also consider a part time position  .  
 can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ? 
 i advised customers on financial matters  .  after i consulted the customer   _comma_   i completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database  .  i then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client  .  the clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that i formulated on a quarterly basis  .  
 what is your greatest strength ? 
 i am an excellent communicator  .  people trust me and come to me for advice  .  one afternoon   _comma_   my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well  .  i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together  .  
 what is your greatest weakness ? 
 i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied  .  however   _comma_   i began setting time limits for myself  .  
 why do you want to work for our company ? 
 after following your firm s progress for the last   years   _comma_   i am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and i would like to be a part of that team  .  
 when can you begin ? 
 immediately  .  
please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules  .  
 well    _comma_    all right  .  there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents    _comma_    information and other things  .  
 what are they ? 
 they are keep the documents in chronological order    _comma_    remove all the chips and pins    _comma_    punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder  .  
 and what is the most important point ? 
 you should always remember that one customer one file is the rule  .  
yeah    _comma_    look at all those new buildings going up ! mr  .  zhang    _comma_    the traffic is pretty smooth  .  but we were told the roads from the airport to downtown were quite crowded and traffic jams could be as long as half an hour  .  
 yes   _comma_   they were  .  but it has already past  .  the traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of yan an aerial road  .  
 we ve never expected that shanghai is such a big metropolis    _comma_    same as new york city  .  david    _comma_    would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? i ve got an international driver s license with a pretty good record in the states  .  
 that s wonderful  .  ok  .  i ll remember that  .  but i have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area    _comma_    for there re no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places    _comma_    and still quite a few people don t take road regulations seriously  .  
this house is not looking all that great from here 
 you can ’ t really tell everything about a house from the outside  .  let ’ s go inside  .

 it is just too dark in here with so few windows  .  
 i hear that the kitchen is quite large  .  let ’ s go check it out  .  
 the kitchen may be large   _comma_   but it doesn ’ t have any storage space  .

 i actually like the food there  .  
 does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ? 
 they have anything you want  .  
 i was thinking about getting some chinese food  .

here is the draft contract    _comma_    mr  .  brown  .  let s discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them  .  then i will make out an original of the contract  .  after that    _comma_    what s left is to fill out the contract and sign our names  .  
 that s ok  .  
 the contract is to be written in chinese and english  .  both languages are equally effective  .  
 fine  .  if you ll excuse me    _comma_    i d like to go it over first  .  ( after about    minutes ) hmm    _comma_    you ve done a pretty good job  .  it s well prepared  .  
 thank you  .  
 well   _comma_   i suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time  .  
 that s a good idea  .  
 first     _comma_     let s read clause two about packing  .  it s our usual practice to ship our products in containers  .  that ll save time and money     _comma_     but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases  .  so     _comma_     we d like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract  .  
 agreed  .  
 for shipment   _comma_   you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won t all be finished at one time  .  so would you allow us to make partial shipments  .  
 i understand your position  .  
i want to buy a black suit  .  
 certainty . do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ? 
 i prefer single breasted suit  .  
 what about this one ? it s a very nice     piece suit  .  
 that looks great  .  do you have ties here ? 
how do you do ? nice to meet you   _comma_   diane  .  
 how do you do   _comma_   jack  .  nice to meet you  .  
 well    _comma_    i think you   ve reconsidered our proposal    _comma_    diane  .  
 yes    _comma_    you are right  .  after all    _comma_    the quality of your air conditioners is good  .  the only problem is price  .  
 i should not be surprised   _comma_   many customers have the same opinion  .  do you have any suggestion in mind ? our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable  .  
 that s why i came to your office today  .  we think for your model we             would be reasonable   _comma_   because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about          .  
 that s true  .  but if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product    _comma_    you ll agree that     is not high    _comma_    especially when we allow you a    % discount  .  
 i see your point  .  that s to say s     each set  .  still it s much higher than the market price  .  could you see your way to reduce the price   _comma_   jack ? 
 well   _comma_   considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to      .  that s the best we can do  .  what do you think of that ? 
 all right  .  we accept it  .  so       for each set  .  
 very well  .  thank you  .  
don t i know you ? 
 i m not sure . you look familiar  .  
 you re mr . stevenson   _comma_   right ? 
 yes . and you re mr . jones   _comma_   i remember  .  
that s all the general information of our company  .  i think you already have good knowledge about our company  .  
 yes   _comma_   i have an overall understanding  .  
 when we have the final results   _comma_   we will call you  .  
 then when will i get a reply at the latest ? 
 if you pass the interview   _comma_   the personnel department will inform you within two weeks  .  
 but if i don t pass   _comma_   will you call me ? 
 i m sorry we won t  .  you can wait for two weeks  .  if you don t get a telephone call   _comma_   it means that you weren t successful  .  
 then do i have the chance to get this job ? 
 i m sorry but i can t make the final decision myself   _comma_   and i have to discuss it with other interviewers  .  
 i know  .  no matter what the result will be   _comma_   i have learned a lot from our conversation  .  
 your mentality is very good and that s great  .  
 thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview  .

 what kind of people do you like to work with ? 
 people who are honest   _comma_   dedicated to their work and having integrity  .

 what s the criteria for staff to attend ? are we only including our management team in this affair ? or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ? 
 lower level employees need not attend  .  the purpose of this retreat is for training    _comma_    especially for our management team  .  we want to develop a well oiled machine on our executive level  .  in order to get everyone to jell together    _comma_    we ve got to include some fun  .  that s the reason for the retreat  .  
i think yoga might be suitable for me  .  
 why ? 
 because it doesn t require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up  .  
 but i see people sweat a lot doing yoga too  .  
 i don t know  .  i just need to try it once  .  i m in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight  .  
 you should try swimming then  .  it helps you to keep fit  .

 is your blood pressure   _comma_   i m afraid  .  it s far too high  .  
 and what s the cause of that ? 
 overwork amongst other things  .  you can t work    hours a day  .  you   ve got to slow down  .  
 but i can t just slow down  .  
 you ve got to   _comma_   i m afraid  .  and look at this  .  you weigh     stones  .  that s too much for a man of your size  .  
 you mean i ve got to lose weight ? 
 yes  .  you ve got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise  .  
you are an early bird   _comma_   tom  .  what do you do in the morning then ?

 no          _comma_          i ve deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars          _comma_          push ups          _comma_          sit ups          _comma_          bunny hops          _comma_          five kilometer run          _comma_          and so on  .  i alternate them over the weekdays  .  sometimes          _comma_          when i find myself in a bad state          _comma_          i will simply idle about in the park  .  
 why don t you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? 
 it s not easy to keep a good habit          _comma_          you know  .  i fear that if i fail to get up early one day          _comma_          i may find it still more difficult to rise early the next  .  besides          _comma_          a mere walk in the early morning is much fun          _comma_          too  .  here and there in the park          _comma_          you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs          _comma_          playing er hu          _comma_          chess          _comma_          or just chatting and gossiping  .  it s interesting to join them  .

 i wish i was free that night  .  i m kind of mad that i didn t go  .  
 it was a great game  .  
 what was the score at the end of the game ? 
 our team won         .  
 sounds like it was a close game  .  
 that s the reason it was such a great game  .  
 the next game   _comma_   i will definitely be there  .  
have you ever tried shopping online ? 
 no    _comma_    never  .  i prefer to actually see and touch what i m buying before i pay for it    _comma_    especially for clothes and shoes  .  
 that s right  .  seeing is believing  .  
 i ve heard some friends say when they get the article   _comma_   it s quite different from what they see on the website advertisement  .  
 that happens  .  without close quality examination    _comma_    we may encounter fraud    _comma_    and the e shop may suddenly disappear  .  
 what s more   _comma_   it s not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password  .  
 it s said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem  .  paying online is much safer than before   _comma_   but i still have the feeling that it s not safe enough  .  
 i can t agree more  .  that s why i only do street shopping  .  
 me too  .  sometimes i surf online shops to check some related information   _comma_   and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping  .  
 that s a good idea  .  
how long does it take to get to downtown from here ? 
 it is    minutes ’ drive  .  
 what companies do we have in our neighborhood ? 
 mitsubishi    _comma_    hp    _comma_    ibm and many other famous corporations  .  
 does the  th floor belong to our company too ? 
 yes    _comma_    our company has two floors    _comma_    the  th and  th floor in this building  .  
 it ’ s such a large firm  .  do we have our own staff restaurant ? 
 yes   _comma_   at the end of the hall  .  
good morning   _comma_   sir  .  may i help you ?

 thank you very much  .

 i m not sure yet  .  
 what makes you think there was a break in ? 
 my front window was busted  .  
 i ll send a squad car  .  
 please hurry  .  
good morning   _comma_   everyone  .  let me introduce myself to you  .  
 you don t need to introduce yourself   _comma_   yang  .  you re famous  .  
 well   _comma_   thank you very much but i thought l d try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while  .  
 ok   _comma_   ok ! 
 now     _comma_     i d like to get things under way  .  the main topic on today s agenda is the development of a u  .  s  .  sales strategy for the new ebb  .  i d like to hear all of your ideas     _comma_     mr  .  wall     _comma_     you seem in top form today  .  could you start the ball rolling ? 
 uh     _comma_     oh     _comma_     sure  .  well     _comma_     i think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising  .  
 well   _comma_   that s kind of obvious  .  
 give me a break   _comma_   mr yang  .  
 uh    _comma_    let s keep this going    _comma_    shall we ? 
i m sorry   _comma_   but i don t think this damage is our fault  .  
 what do you mean ? 
 it looks like the shipping company did this  .  
 we d better take it up with them   _comma_   in that case  .  
i ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me    _comma_    mr  .  johnson  .  i can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today    _comma_    the ambiance here is lovely ! 
 no problem    _comma_    if possible i always combine business with pleasure  .  now    _comma_    let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering  .  
 well       _comma_       as you know       _comma_       i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bon bons here in the united states  .  they ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market  .  naturally       _comma_       your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately  .  i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant       _comma_       luxurious       _comma_       first class dining  .  
 mmmm    _comma_    sounds interesting  .  gourmet chocolates    _comma_    where are they produced ? belgium ? 
 actually   _comma_   the factory is located in scotland  .  
 really ? i didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production 
 that ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units  .  they ’ ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well  .  here    _comma_    i brought these especially for you    _comma_    try one ! 
 oh      _comma_      thanks  .  mmm      _comma_      hmm      _comma_      creamy texture      _comma_      very smooth  .  
 unique   _comma_   aren ’ t they ? i bet you ’ ve never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients  .  only the creme make it through inspection  .  
 yes     _comma_     very interesting flavors  .  slightly spicy     _comma_     very unique     _comma_     that ’ s for sure  .  exactly what are the ingredients ? 
 i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations  .  i ’ m sure you can keep a secret  .  buttermilk    _comma_    cacao beans    _comma_    sugar and haggis  .  
 haggis ? what ’ s haggis ? 
 it ’ s a traditional scottish delicacy    _comma_    you take sheep ’ s liver    _comma_    heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach  .  
 ah   _comma_   get back to you  .  
 mr  .  johnson ? mr  .  johnson ? 
do you need a guide ? 
 yes   _comma_   we are just looking for one  .  what s the charge per day ? 
 it s       .  if you are staying for more than   days in the city   _comma_   the charge is      per day  .  
 that s reasonable  .  
aren t you jim green ? 
 yes   _comma_   that s right  .  
 i believe we met at a concert last year  .  i m taylor  .  
 oh   _comma_   yes  .  i remember  .  
lucy     _comma_     i ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor     _comma_     it keeps flashing     _comma_     which drives me crazy  .  would you like to help me with the ladder ? 
 monica   _comma_   wait a moment  .  i think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it  .  
 i think i can handle it by myself  .  
 i ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company  .  
 i see  .  if i got hurt when fixing the light    _comma_    even during office hours    _comma_    i wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility  .  
 other company rules also need your attention  .  
 like this one ? never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . yeah   _comma_   thank you for telling me  .  
 don ’ t mention it  .  
thank god ! i am finished writing that service guide ! it took me forever ! 
 when did you finish ? 
 this morning ! no more overtime   _comma_   and no more headaches ! 
 well   _comma_   i ’ m glad to hear it  .  have a cup of coffee ! 
i didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why  .  
 did you mail us your last continued claim form ? 
 i am afraid that i forgot to send it in  .  
 we cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks  .  
 is it too late to mail the continued claim form in now ? 
 it can ’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it  .  
 i will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem  .  
 you can ’ t possibly know in advance how much you will be working  .  if you mail it in too soon   _comma_   we will reject it ! 
 will my paycheck arrive late because i messed up on my form ? 
 your check will be arriving late   _comma_   but the next one will come right on time  .  
i should tell you that i m checking out in about    minutes  .  
 i m ready when you are   _comma_   sir  .  
 very good ! now   _comma_   it s still morning here in new york  .  
 you are so right   _comma_   sir  .  the clock just struck nine  .  
 i m going to spend some time exploring the city  .  what can i do with my luggage ? 
 sir    _comma_    right here we have a storage site  .  its only     an hour    _comma_    but you need to leave a deposit  .  
 a deposit ? isn t my luggage a deposit ? 
 i m sorry    _comma_    sir    _comma_    but it isn t  .  your mastercard or visa will take care of things nicely  .  
 okay  .  let me think about this  .  
 okay   _comma_   sir  .  but don t take too long  .  you only have    minutes  .  
may i take your order ? 
 yes  .  i d like a cup of onion soup  .  
 and what would you like after that ? 
 i d like the roast chicken   _comma_   please  .  
it s the latest and quite popular among young people  .  
 yes   _comma_   i know and i like it very much  .  i will take it  .  
 sure  .  here is your receipt  .  
 how long is this cell phone guaranteed ? 
 you can refund it in   days and exchange it in one year  .  
hey honey   _comma_   how was your day ? 
 it was alright  .  i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while  .  he ’ s in a bit of a jam  .  
 why ? what happened ? 
 well    _comma_    his son had an accident and bill doesn ’ t have health insurance  .  this really got me thinking    _comma_    and i wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different hmo ’ s  .  
 yeah   _comma_   you ’ re right  .  we aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older  .  
 exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo ’ s with low co pays and good coverage  .  the deductibles are low   _comma_   too  .  
 sounds good    _comma_    although    _comma_    do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money  .  
 well    _comma_    we don ’ t have any pre existing illnesses or conditions    _comma_    so we should be fine  .  
 i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare  .  
 not in a million years ! 
hello  .  can you tell me what the procedures of applying for a job are ?

 that s all thank you  .  
i need something to wash this down  .  is there any juice in the fridge ? 
 what is that ? it looks like something from a swamp ! 
 it s a green drink  .  it s supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals  .  
 you know   _comma_   healthy eating doesn t have to make you gag  .  
 the sales lady said that even if i eat right   _comma_   i wouldn t get enough vitamins  .  
 have you ever tried it ? or are you just going to believe the sales lady ? 
 it s easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day  .  
 it may take less time   _comma_   but i don t know about easier  .  yuck  .  
billy   _comma_   you are late again  .  
 i m sorry i m late  .  i overslept  .  is the manager here today ? 
 yes he   s in his office  .  
 oh   _comma_   i hope he didn t notice me  .  
 don t take any chances  .  it d be best if you told him and promised not to be late again  .  he s already mad at you for last   times  .  any more and he might fire you  .  
 you said it  .  it won t happen again  .  do you really think he d fire me ? 
 i think he might  .  you d better go to his office  .  
 you are probably right  .  i ll go right now and apologize  .  i try hard not to be late but it is difficult with beijing traffic  .  
 good luck !

is there anything else   _comma_   apart from the credit rating and debt to asset ratio ? 
 there is the balance of net liabilities  .  this must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years  .  
 right     _comma_     ok  .  that     _comma_     again     _comma_     shouldn t be a problem  .  
 and the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average    _comma_    for that particular industry    _comma_    for the first two quarters of the year  .  
 well    _comma_    as far as i can tell    _comma_    we qualify  .

hi   _comma_   sam  .  i want to buy a pet  .  do you have any ideas ? 
 you really should go to rachel s pet store  .  
 why ? anything special there ? 
 it s more than special  .  you can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more  .  
 oh   _comma_   really ? are there any snakes ? 
 snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it s a world of exotic pets  .  
 that s terrific  .  i can t wait to check it out  .  
 hang on  .  are you sure you want to keep a non traditional pet ? 
 why not ? it s so cool  .  
 but it will pose a risk to your health  .  
 pardon ? 
 i mean    _comma_    most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria    _comma_    they are likely to cause immune system problems  .  
 well   _comma_   i didn t realize that  .  
 i don t believe it s a good choice to keep those pets   _comma_   especially for families with young children  .  
 oh   _comma_   i should have thought of my brother s baby girl  .  maybe i ll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet  .  
 yes    _comma_    good luck    _comma_    maria  .  
hello   _comma_   this is room       .  our message lamp is flashing  .

 thank you  .  
 i am sorry to have kept you waiting  .  mr  .  johns needs a telephone call from you  .  
 would you bring the message to my room  .  
 i m afraid we have nobody available at the moment  .  
 then i ll come down and pick up the message immediately  .  
 ok   _comma_   we wait for you  .  
guess what ? i ve got great news ! 
 what is it ? 
 well    _comma_    you know how i ve been working at the economist as a proof reader    _comma_    right ? 
 yes  .  
 well   _comma_   the editor in chief heard that i had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if i was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him  .  
 really ? that s fantastic ! will you get a chance to do any writing ? 
 she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that i could be in charge of the column until she came back  .  
 wow ! that s really great news  .  how often does the magazine come out ? 
 it s a monthly magazine   _comma_   but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly  .  
 are you looking forward to doing more editing work ? 
 yes   _comma_   but i m even more excited about getting my thoughts published again ! 
 do you have any order forms here so that i can get a subscription to the magazine ? 
 i don t have any with me   _comma_   but i think i could manage to bring a free copy home for you  .  
 i m really looking forward to reading your column  .  
 me   _comma_   too  .  do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ? 
 sure   _comma_   where would you like to go ? 
 perhaps we could go to the library festival that s going on at the local bookshop  .  
have you seen the new cosmo magazine that i was reading this morning ? 
 i think i may have seen it on the kitchen table  .  
 you re right   _comma_   thanks  .  there s an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that i want to finish  .  
 who s the director ? 
 it s martin scorsese  .  you liked his film    _comma_    the departed    _comma_    didn t you ? 
 yes   _comma_   it was fantastic ! can i read the article when you re finished ? 
 sure  .  you know it has an online edition   _comma_   too  .  you should go online to read if you want to read it now  .  
 that s ok  .  i ll wait until you re finished  .  just out of curiosity   _comma_   do you have a subscription for that magadize ? 
 no  .  i don t buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile  .  
 how much does the magadize cost ? 
 it s almost three pounds now   _comma_   and i think they re going to put the price up to four pounds soon  .  
 that s quite expensive  .  who is their target audience ? 
 cosmo mainly has a middle class readership   _comma_   but i think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore  .  
 i bet you ll still buy it   _comma_   though  .  you wouldn t be able to live without your fashion magazine ! 
wei ! this is a first you didn t bargain ! 
 bargain ? i d feel way too guilty  .  
 but you could have saved money  .  
 from a sweet ma ? ! it s not worth it  .  plus   _comma_   i d happily pay more for these things i bought ! 
 f  .  y  .  i  .     _comma_    there is a flea market nearby    _comma_    but maybe you re done  .  
 ha ! i m just warming up ! please take me there now ! 
can you help me do an internet search ? 
 sure  .  what do you want to find ? 
 i want to find information on the american civil war  .  
 well   _comma_   can you be more specific ? there are a lot of websites about that  .  
 yes   _comma_   i want to know about the battle of gettysburg  .

 for detailed information    _comma_    however    _comma_    you should read a history book  .

 the best way to reach him is by cell phone  .  i ll give you his number  .  
 thanks  .  and could i have his e mail   _comma_   just in case i can t get him by phone ?

 that ’ s great ! i ’ m glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon  .  right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras  .  is pear still interested in having those ? 
 no   _comma_   we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels  .  we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal  .  
 surely  .  let ’ s get started by drafting a new contract  .

 he didn t even make it out the door  .  
hello ! what are you reading about in the newspaper ? 
 hello ! i was exhausted form studying    _comma_    so i decided to read the newspaper to relax  .  unfortunately    _comma_    the news is so depressing  .  there has been another murder in the city center  .  i ’ m shocked that the pole 
 people are starting to get frightened by it  .  everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder  .  
 you mean if they catch the murderer  .  i ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night  .  
 there must have been some good news in the newspaper  .  i can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited  .  
 well   _comma_   there was one good piece of news  .  you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? 
 yes  .  her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states  .  
 well   _comma_   they ’ ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment  .  
 i ’ m so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that  .  
 i ’ m sure they are  .  oh   _comma_   and a local man won the lottery  .  i ’ m so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i ’ m amazed that i haven ’ t even won a small prize yet  .  it ’ s so unfair ! 
 don ’ t be moody ! i hope you ’ re not tired   _comma_   because we ’ ve been invited to a party this evening  .  i know how excited you get about parties  .  
how much is it all together ? 
 let me see  .  the bell bottom pants are      and the coat is        .  it comes to        .  
 is it possible for you to reduce the price ? 
 i am sorry  .  it s a one price shop  .  
this is the bell captain s desk  .  may i help you ? 
 yes   _comma_   i ve been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour  .  where are they ? 
 i m very sorry to hear that  .  may i have your name and room number   _comma_   please ? 
 yes   _comma_   it s yao lan  .  room      .  
 and how many pieces did you have ? 
 two suitcases and a handbag  .  the suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red  .

 no   _comma_   this isn t  .  
 could you please get him on the phone ? 
 sure  .  wait a minute  .  
it s especially cold when the wind is blowing  .  
 why don t you wear a scarf ? 
 what can wearing one do for me ? 
 you re cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar  .  it s not because your jacket isn t thick enough  .  
 so wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket  .  
 yes  .  that s the secret to wearing a thin jacket  .  
 you know   _comma_   sometimes i can t feel my ears and fingers  .  
 i ll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own  .  
 thanks   _comma_   pam  .  you re my lifesaver  .  
hey   _comma_   could you help me try and figure out how to get ready for my job interview ?

 yes   _comma_   i pretty much understand the company  .  
 well    _comma_    after you ve done your research    _comma_    you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal  .  have you decided what they are yet ? 
 yes   _comma_   i ve been observing them  .  
 when you are choosing what to wear   _comma_   keep all of that in mind  .  have you chosen what to wear ? 
 i already have something to wear  .  
 i would always be ready to go shopping with you ! should we talk about other basics ? 
 ok   _comma_   i am ready to think of other things  .  
 you need to make sure you arrive on time     _comma_     smile     _comma_     be pleasant and friendly     _comma_     look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability  .  you ll do great ! 
is there anything i can do for you ? 
 would you please show me that mural ? 
 certainly  .  here you are  .  
 it looks so beautiful  .  how much is it ? 
 four hundred yuan  .  
 that s a bit more than i wanted to pay  .  can you cut the price down a bit ? 
 i m sorry  .  ours is a fixed price shop and i can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this  .  
 maybe you are right  .  ok   _comma_   i ll take it  .  
 well   _comma_   i ll have it wrapped for you  .  
 thank you  .  here is four hundred yuan  .  
 thank you  .  please come again  .  
it ’ s so great to be here ! i ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home ! 
 we ’ re glad that you ’ re here  .  would you like a tour of the house ? 
 that ’ d be great   _comma_   but could i have a cup of tea first ? 
 sure   _comma_   i ’ ll just go put the kettle on  .  why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and i ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen  .  
 that would be lovely   _comma_   thanks  .  
 do you take milk or sugar with your tea ? 
 i ’ ll take a little milk    _comma_    but no sugar    _comma_    please  .  make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup  .  
 ok  .  what do you think about our living room ? 
 well    _comma_    i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table    _comma_    but i don ’ t really care for curtains  .  did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient  .  
 my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift  .  
 oh dear  .  well   _comma_   i suppose they will do for now  .  do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here  .  
 your daughter usually does the dusting   _comma_   and i do the vacuuming  .  
 i see  .  well   _comma_   i can help with the chores while i ’ m here  .  you two could probably use my help  .  
 that ’ s very nice of you to offer  .  here ’ s your tea  .  be careful   _comma_   it ’ s still quite hot  .  
my lease ends next month   _comma_   so i have to find a new place  .  
 i feel sorry for you  .  it s a jungle out there  .  
 do you know any places ? 
 well  .  i guess i can ask around to see if anyone s got a room or apartment available  .  
 thank you  .  i think i should also have a look at the internet to see if anyone s got a sublet  .  
 how much do are you looking to spend ? 
 i can only afford about    _comma_      yuan a month  .  
 looks like you ll have to get a place in the suburbs  .  
 it doesn t matter   _comma_   but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route  .  
 anything you need to have in the place ? 
 i want a bedroom with full bath   _comma_   and it ll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side  .  
 you can also check out university bulletin boards  .  
 why ? will those be students who are leaving ? 
 not really   _comma_   but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent  .  
 thank you  .  i ll be sure to take a look  .  
 good luck  .  
good afternoon   _comma_   how may i help you ?

 oh    _comma_    good  .  irene    _comma_    can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? don t you like your present job ? 
 frankly    _comma_    some part of it i enjoy very much    _comma_    but i prefer something more professional  .  it happens that i have a friend working here in this company  .  she told me the export department was to recruit an assistant  .  i felt very excited at this news  .  that s why i m here  .  
this looks wonderful   _comma_   madame culot  .

 thank you  .  mmm  .  can you tell me about the terrine ? 
 yes  .  a terrine is a kind of meat pate  .  it s meat turned into a paste  .  it sounds horrible but it s actually really good  .  
 mmm  .  maybe another time  .  
 you could try the ravioli  .  they are rather like your chinese dumplings   _comma_   and the sauce is delicious  .  
 sounds good  .  i think i ll have the lamb for my main course  .  what does it come with ? 
 well   _comma_   you can have fries french fries or simple boiled potatoes  .

i have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate  .  may i ask why i was defeated ? 
 we have thought of you carefully with discretion   _comma_   but the other candidate has more experiences  .  
 experience is important   _comma_   but don t you think capability is more valuable than that ? 
 yes   _comma_   i think so  .  but how do you prove to me that you are more capable ? 
 maybe you can hire me on trial  .  if i m not qualified for the job   _comma_   you can let me go  .  
 good idea  .  
excuse me   _comma_   sir . is there a barber near here ? 
 yes   _comma_   the nearest one is at the third cross of this road  .

 it ’ s not that bad   _comma_   besides it really looks nice in that corner  .  it gives the room a good atmosphere  .  
 a good atmosphere ? the tree is falling apart   _comma_   and it ’ s messing up the room  .  
 but it makes the place feel so much like christmas  .  i ’ d really hate to have to take it down  .  
 but christmas was two weeks ago ! it ’ s been there only because we ’ ve been too busy to get rid of it  .  
 i know   _comma_   but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away  .  
 but it ’ s falling apart   _comma_   and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches  .  
 i know       _comma_       i know  .  but it reminds me of the great christmas we just had  .  all of us were here     my parents       _comma_       your parents       _comma_       the kids       _comma_       and the cousins     the food was good       _comma_       and everybody got what they wanted  .  
 yeah    _comma_    it was a good christmas  .  it won ’ t always be this good    _comma_    but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should  .  
 ok   _comma_   fine  .  we need to take down the tree  .

so tell me     _comma_     what s the difference between the board of directors     _comma_     the ceo     _comma_     and the stockholders ? they all seems ot be the same group of people to me  .  
 no        _comma_        there s a definite difference  .  you know        _comma_        the stockholders are the people who own the company  .  they re the financial control system  .  then there s the ceo — the chief executive officer  .  he s the hot shot        _comma_        the main guy who is the boss  .  if there is only one person with absolute power in the organization        _comma_        everyone knows that the power will go to their head  .  it s too dangerous  .  that s the reason for a board of directors  .  the board is made up of people who are experts in the industry  .  they could be related to the organization        _comma_        but more commonly        _comma_        they are independent and non biased  .  
 how many people are on the board of directors ? 
 usually not more than         _comma_      not less than     .  they meet monthly      _comma_      quarterly      _comma_      or biannually to oversee an organization or company  .  they provide long term planing and vision      _comma_      and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line  .  
how much will my pay be   _comma_   if you don ’ t mind my asking ? 
 we would like to start you off at       _comma_         yuan a month      _comma_      not including bonus and overtime pay  .  we don ’ t give bonus every month      _comma_      but we offer a semi annual bonus  .  and you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year      _comma_      as well  .  does it suit you ? 
 yes   _comma_   thank you  .  may i ask for an apartment ?

 i couldn ’ t remember  .  
 whatever  .  just make sure you go vote  .

 ok   _comma_   but don t tell anyone what i said  .  
you get your bus pass ? 
 i m not going to buy one  .  
 you re not ? 
 i think it s a waste of money  .  
 it actually costs less if you have a bus pass  .  
 how is that ? 
 you can use it however many times you need to  .  
 is that right ? 
 yup   _comma_   and you can keep the money in your pocket  .

 how about there ? 
do you like cooking ? 
 i love it  .  i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ? 
 i don ’ t like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having it clean up after the meal  .  i can ’ t stand doing the washing up   _comma_   drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away  .  
 you can ask the guests for help  .  my guests usually insist on doing the washing up  .  i just have to remind them where everything goes  .  
 so what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food  .  
 italian   _comma_   indian and chinese  .  i ’ ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice  .  
 do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ? 
 not at all . you can find most of them in supermarkets . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference   _comma_   not the ingredients  .  
 how long does it take you to cook a meal for   or   people ? 
 obviously   _comma_   it depends on what i ’ m cooking . but i ’ d say it generally takes about one and a half hours  .  
i m searching for an old music box  .  
 you came to the right place  .  any particular decade ? 
 if you had a box made in the     s   _comma_   that would be nice  .  
 we just got one in yesterday   _comma_   so now we have six  .  
 would any of them have dancing figures ? 
 yes   _comma_   we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures  .  
 oh    _comma_    they re both so beautiful  .  let me have this one    _comma_    i think  .  
 that one truly is a beautiful piece of work   _comma_   isn t it ? 
 one last question 
 oh   _comma_   no  .  everything we sell here is   as is  .    
 i guess i was asking for too much  .  
 if it breaks down   _comma_   maybe you can find a repairman on the internet  .  
we have been over this a hundred times ! we are not getting a pet ! 
 why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy  .  or a kitty ! 
 who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? 
 i will ! i ’ ll feed it   _comma_   bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a labrador or a german shepard ! 
 what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus   _comma_   our apartment is too small for that breed of dog  .  
 ok  .  how about we get a cat or a ferret ? 
 we ’ re planning on having children soon   _comma_   i don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house  .  
 fine ! let ’ s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome ! 
 i ’ ll tell you what   _comma_   i can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there  .  
 yay ! 
over here is our gym  .  we have all the latest equipment  .  
 but i haven t used exercising equipment before  .  can you tell us some more details ? 
 certainly  .  we have here the race apparatus       _comma_       stationary bike       _comma_       muscle builder set       _comma_       chest expander       _comma_       bar bell       _comma_       dumb bell and so on  .  
 working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight  .  what else do you have ? 
 here s the swimming pool  .  it s open from    a  .  m  .  to    p  .  m  .  there are also massage rooms here  .  
 that s wonderful ! i like swimming  .  
john   _comma_   i was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year  .  
 i ve already told my buddy    _comma_    mark    _comma_    that i am going hunting with him in alaska  .  
 you can t be serious ! 
 hey   _comma_   i ve always gone hunting or fishing on vacation  .  i am sorry that bothers you  .  
 after a year together   _comma_   i thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together  .  
 says who ? i don t think that is necessarily the case  .  
 you know    _comma_    now that i think about it    _comma_    i really don t have much more to say to you at all ! 
 whatever you say ! 
have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ? 
 not yet  .  i don t know how to fill out the form  .  what is the tax free allowance for supporting a dependent ? 
 i don t really know  .  why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? they will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation  .  he can even help you avoid paying tax legally  .  
 if i don t pay my taxes   _comma_   would the tax officials discover it ? 
 certainly  .  no one who evades tax can escape from their detection . they   ll check your income through computers  .  you d better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible  .  if you fail to meet the deadline   _comma_   you will be fined  .  
what s up ? you sound a little down in dumps  .  
 i quarreled with my roommate last night  .  he is really stubborn  .  
 calm down ! shouting won ’ t help ? 
 he is really outrageous  .  
 what happened ? 
 i went back home last night  .  you know tired as a dog     _comma_     so i took a quick shower and went to bed  .  i couldn t fall asleep     _comma_     because brian was there in the living room     _comma_     playing his stupid stereo so loud  .  i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit  .  he shouted at me  .  
 what ? he can t do this to you  .  
 well   _comma_   he did it anyway  .  then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah  .  you know  .  
 what did you do ? 
 i shouted it back of course  .  
 hold it    _comma_    mike  .  you won t accomplish anything by hollering at him    _comma_    right ? you worked it all up till now  .  why not wait until you cool down a bit ? 
 what would you do if you were in my shoes ? 
 just stay cool  .  you know  .  when you get back home tonight   _comma_   tell him that you didn t mean to quarrel with him  .  
 no way   _comma_   kate  .  i mean it s just not my fault  .  
 i know  .  it wouldn t hurt much to say sorry first  .  and after that   _comma_   you can casually mention the problem  .  i am sure he will cooperate  .  
 i am too angry to do that  .  
excuse me  .  i am looking for a book called little women   _comma_   but i can t find it anywhere  .  
 let me see  .  i am sorry we just have sold it out  .  
 will you have it later ? 
 i think so  .  could i have you name    _comma_    telephone number ? if we get one    _comma_    i will call you  .  
 that s terrific  .  thank you  .  
who do you think is the greatest novelist in the history of english literature ? 
 charles dickens . actually no one can parallel him in writing  .  
 i m afraid i can t agree with you on that  .  i like d . h . laurence   s novels better  .  
what game do you like ? 
 i like board games  .  i like chinese chess and draughts  .  
 i ’ ve never played chinese chess before   _comma_   but i ’ ve seen old men playing it in the street  .  it looks complicated  .  
 it ’ s about as complicated as chess  .  the basic rule and moves are simple enough   _comma_   but there are many strategies that players need to learn  .  
 i like playing cards  .  i ’ m pretty good at poker  .  do you play cards ? 
 i ’ m terrible at cards and so i never play games which involve gambling    _comma_    like poker  .  if i did    _comma_    i ’ d lose all my money  .  
 do you play bridge ? 
 yes     _comma_     i do  .  it ’ s hard to find four players though     _comma_     so i don ’ t play very often  .  do you know anyone who plays ? if so     _comma_     we could set up a game  .  
 i can play quite well  .  i have a friend who likes playing   _comma_   but she ’ s not very good at it  .  shall i invite her to play ? 
 sure   _comma_   i have a friend who play fairly well  .  we should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game  .  
 i ’ ll call my friend now  .  you call yours  .  
can you give me more details on what is included in the package ? 
 sure  .  the coach leaves at  :   a  .  m  .     _comma_    in front of our office  .  the drive takes eight hours    _comma_    with two stops to see some sights  .  
 what about the hotel accommodations ? 
 you ll be staying at holiday inn  .  it s a three star hotel with two restaurants and a swimming pool  .  
 great  .  what types of things will we do at lushun falls ? 
 the second day you take a four hour city tour  .  in the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls  .  
hello   _comma_           .  
 oh hello   _comma_   sally  .  this is dave thomson here  .  could i speak to jim please ? 
 i m afraid he s not in at the moment dave  .  he went out about an hour ago and he s not back yet  .  
 any idea when he might be back ? 
 well   _comma_   he shouldn t be long  .  he said he was just going to get some paint  .  but i wouldn t be surprised if he s stopped off at the pub on the way back  .  
 ok  .  well     _comma_     tell him i ve called     _comma_     will you     _comma_     and i ll try again later  .

 yes  .  go to the next corner and turn left onto center street  .  walk three blocks to second avenue and turn right  .  walk two more blocks and you ll see city hall on the left  .  
 i m sorry  .  i didn t follow you  .  could you please repeat that ? 
 okay  .  first   _comma_   go to the next corner and turn left onto center street  .  
 uh huh  .  
 then   _comma_   walk three blocks to second avenue an turn right  .  are you with me so far ? 
 yes  .  i m following you  .  
 then   _comma_   walk two more blocks an you ’ ll see city hall on the left  .  have you got all that ? 
 yes  .  now i ve got it  .  thank you very much  .  
what s up ? 
 nothing much   _comma_   what s going on ? 
 i m having a party this friday  .

 i wanted to see if you wanted to come  .  
 this friday ? sorry   _comma_   i already have plans  .  
 doing what ? 
 i m going to dinner with my family  .  
 i really wanted you to come   _comma_   but i understand  .  
 yeah   _comma_   maybe next time  .  
 i ll hold you to that  .  
 sounds like a plan  .  
i find that you spend little on handset charge every month  .  have you any trick ? 
 it s simple  .  you can use call transfer  .  
 is it so simple ? 
 sure  .  you know     _comma_     we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day     _comma_     so i receive handset calls with the hand free telephone     _comma_     so i need pay little for receiving calls  .  
 it s true  .  
 call transfer has many other advantages  .  when i am in places where network can t cover     _comma_     such as the high building     _comma_     i also use call transfer function     _comma_     which transfers my calls to the hand free telephone and i will not miss any call  .  
 that s all ? 
 in hospitals or on planes     _comma_     handsets will interfere with some equip ment     _comma_     so we must close our handsets  .  if you set call transfer     _comma_     the problem will be solved  .  
are you doing anything tomorrow morning ? i m wondering if you d like to come to my office to discuss the new project  .  
 tomorrow morning ? what about tomorrow afternoon ?

 oh   _comma_   i see  .  you have two choices here you can either redeem or renew  .  
 i think i ll redeem   _comma_   if that s not a problem  .  
 no problem at all   _comma_   mr waterstone  .  any preference as to how you want the money ? 
 anything you like   _comma_   but not too many large notes  .  it s useful to have smaller notes  .  
 here we go   _comma_   mr waterstone  .  here s your money and your interest note  .  
 yes    _comma_    yes  .  everything s fine  .  thank you very much    _comma_    becky  .

 thanks  .  well   _comma_   those two kids are beginners  .  what should i do about their safety ? 
 well     _comma_     there are a lot to do     _comma_     but nothing to worry about  .  first     _comma_     make sure they don t go far from the railings  .  
 oh    _comma_    yeah    _comma_    maybe i should ask them just to walk along the railings  .  
 that s a good idea  .  and remind them to be slow at the beginning   _comma_   not to run into the railings  .  
 ok  .  anything else ? 
 never go to the center of the lake  .  the ice there is too thin to skate on  .  
 got it  .  thanks for reminding me  .  and   _comma_   are there any intensive training courses ? 
excuse me sir  .  may i come in ? 
 mike   _comma_   you re late again  .  
 i m sorry    _comma_    but my sister was ill    _comma_    so i 
 do you think i believe the story like that ? 
 but it s true  .  
 how can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? 
 that s coincident 。 
 ok   _comma_   hold it  .  remember to be punctual next time 。 
 i promise i will  .

 darling  .  i think you have made a mistake  .  
 i have made a mistake ? 
 yes  .  we married on july    ten years ago  .  
 july    ? but i think it should be june     .  
 yes  .  we had planned to marry on june       _comma_    but something happened    _comma_    so we had to put off our wedding day  .  
 yes  .  i remember now  .  we put it off  .  i did make a mistake  .  but how shall we deal with the tickets ? 
 since you have booked  .  then let ’ s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand  .  
do you want some dessert ? 
 no    _comma_    thank you  .  check    _comma_    please  .  
 wait a moment  .  i will calculate it for you  .  your bill comes to       .  
 here are       .  keep the change  .  that s my tip for you  .  
food is less expensive in a cafeteria   _comma_   because you serve yourself  .  
 how to do it ? 
 just pick up a tray     _comma_     then put a knife     _comma_     a fork     _comma_     a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line  .  
 how long will it take to reach the buffet ? 
 not long   _comma_   because people rush for lunch  .  
 the line sure does move fast  .  
 tell the man behind the counter what you want  .  
 ok  .  i like that green vegetable but i don t know how to call it  .  
 just point to it if you don t know the name  .  
 all right  .  
hey   _comma_   did you hear about jessica s party this weekend ? 
 yeah   _comma_   but i m still waiting for my invitation  .  
 oh really ? she gave me mine earlier today  .  
 well   _comma_   she ll probably just give me my invitation later on today  .  
 yeah   _comma_   so are you planning on going ? 
 i think so  .  it sounds like it s going to be a lot of fun  .  
 it really does   _comma_   i can t wait  .  
 what time does the party start ? 
 it starts at   o clock  .  
 oh    _comma_    well    _comma_    how many people has she given invites to so far ? 
 i m not sure   _comma_   but i don t think she s given out that many  .  
 well   _comma_   hopefully she ll give me my invite later on today  .  
after the financial crisis   _comma_   many industries are in incredibly cloudy situations  .  how do you think about our company ? 
 the outlook in the future is very positive  .  because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely  .  
 as the department i am applying for is expanding   _comma_   i would like to contribute by effort  .  
 great  .  welcome to our company  .  
farmer s pet store  .  
 can you please tell me where you are located ? 
 sure    _comma_    we are off singing road    _comma_    close to the bank  .  
 thank you   _comma_   i know where that is  .  
hi    _comma_    bob    _comma_    this is john lin  .  
 hello   _comma_   john  .  
 i m with hartford public relations  .  i d like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services  .  
 how about tomorrow at    o clock ? 
hey    _comma_    tom    _comma_    did you enjoy your lunch ? 
 oh   _comma_   don t mention it  .  it was terrible  .  
 what   the matter ? 
 the food station was as crowded as usual  .  i waited for    minutes for my sandwich   _comma_   and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone  .  
 i see  .  you simply can t blame the server for this  .  
 yes   _comma_   i know  .  fast food is so popular in this district  .  
 that s true  .  
 anyway    _comma_    how was your such    _comma_    catherine ? 
 it was good  .  i brought lunch from home today  .  
 you did ? i thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in america  .  
 well   _comma_   i personally don t like them because i don t believe that they are healthy  .  
 i guess you re right  .  more often than not      _comma_      people go there only for convenience  .  the foods may taste good      _comma_      but generally speaking      _comma_      they are high in calories      _comma_      salt and fat  .  
 yes  .  i am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle   _comma_   don t you ? 
 you bet  .  almost all top brands such as mcdonald s and kfc are from america  .  
 well   _comma_   actually two thirds of americans may avoid these places  .  
 seriously ? 
 yeah   _comma_   it s hard to believe but true  .  
have you seen this news article ? apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online  .  
 wow   _comma_   that s really interesting  .  so who won ? 
 well    _comma_    the great wall of china    _comma_    the taj mahal in india  .  
 i ve been there ! it really is an amazing work of architecture and art  .  the entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb   _comma_   the walls are covered with gems and emeralds ! 
 cool ! also amongst the winners is petra    _comma_    in jordan    _comma_    mach pitch in peru and the pyramid in chichenitza in mexico  .  
 wait a minute ! it also says that the christ re deemer statue in brazil and the colosseum in rome are wonders  .  i would love to go to italy and see the colosseum   _comma_   stand in the middle like a gladiator ! 
 well   _comma_   let s see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year  .  
 good idea ! 
hello   _comma_   i d like to reserve a hotel room  .  
 that should be no problem  .  may i have your full name   _comma_   please ? 
 my name is john sandals  .  
 hello    _comma_    mr  .  sandals  .  my name is michelle  .  what days do you need that reservation    _comma_    sir ? 
 i m planning to visit new york from friday    _comma_    april    until monday    _comma_    april     .  
 our room rates recently went up  .  is that okay with you   _comma_   mr  .  sandals ? 
 how much per night are we talking about ? 
 each night will be        .  
 that price is perfectly acceptable  .  
 wonderful ! do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ? 
 nonsmoking   _comma_   please  .  
 next question   _comma_   is a queen size bed okay ? 
 that sounds fine  .  
 okay   _comma_   mr  .  sandals  .  your reservation is in our computer  .  all we need now is a phone number  .  
 certainly  .  my phone number is               .  
 thank you   _comma_   mr  .  sandals  .  we look forward to seeing you in new york ! 
good evening   _comma_   pizza house  .  this is marty speaking . may i take your order ? 
 um yes  .  i d like a medium pizza with pepperoni    _comma_    olives    _comma_    and extra cheese  .  
 we have a two for one special on large pizzas . would you like a large pizza instead ? 
 sure   _comma_   that sounds good  .  
 great ! would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ? 
 no     _comma_     make the second one with ham     _comma_     pineapple and green peppers  .  oh     _comma_     and make it thin crust  .  
 okay   _comma_   thin crust  .  your total is      .    and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ’ s free ! 
 perfect  .  thank you  .  bye  .  
 wait ! ! i need your address ! 
hello   _comma_   personal banking  .  how may i help you ? 
 hi there  .  i m calling about personal internet banking   _comma_   what details can you give me ? 
 personal internet banking is a self service financial service that is based on the internet  .  it can be used by both businesses and individuals  .  we offer an online payment service       _comma_       personal net banking       _comma_       which includes services such as account transfers       _comma_       personal foreign exchange trading  .  you can also get account management services       _comma_       online bill payment       _comma_       for household bills like gas and electricity  .  
 that sounds good  .  at the moment i spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills  .  
i was surprised to see how few people you have on site  .  you provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce  .  
 it depends on the time of year  .  at peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch  .  we also contract out certain services all year round    _comma_    for example    _comma_    cleaning  .  we run a very tight operation ! 
 do you handle the recruiting yourselves ? 
 sometimes we use a local employment agency  .  it depends on the job  .  
jeff    _comma_    look at this listing ! it says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent    _comma_    and it s only       per month  .  what do you think ? 
 well i think i can afford that apartment  .  but are pets allowed ? 
 hmm  .  let me look  .  yes   _comma_   it says it s a pet friendly building  .  
 that s great  .  that means i can bring my cat   _comma_   mr  .  twinkles  .  where is the apartment located ? 
 it says it s located in the suburbs  .  
what would you like to have for dinner ? chicken or beef ? 
 chicken   _comma_   please  .  
 good choice ! 
 what kind of drinks do you have ? 
 well   _comma_   we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices  .  
 in that case   _comma_   let me have a glass of orange juice  .  
 anything else ? 
 i would like to have some tea as well  .  
 another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea  .  
 i see  .  
i d like to apply for a credit card  .  can you help me with my application ? 
 i d be glad to  .  
 i m afraid that i don t have a credit history  .  i just came to this country  .  
 do you have an account with this bank ? 
 i m afraid not  .  
 in that case i highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also  .  that would help with your credit card application  .  
 what is the interest rate on your card ? 
 the annual charge rate is   .   %  .  
 that s very expensive ! 
 not really  .  the credit card is a revolving account  .  you only pay interest on what you owe  .  
 how does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ? 
 you will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized  .  
 does the card provide any other benefits ? 
 you can also get a cash advance up to    _comma_      dollars on this card  .  
you re really fit   _comma_   paul  .  do you exercise very much ? 
 well    _comma_    i almost always get up very early    _comma_    and i lift weights for an hour  .  
 you re kidding ! 
 no  .  and then i often go rollerblading  .  
 wow ! how often do you exercise like that ? 
 about five times a week  .  what about you ? 
 oh   _comma_   i hardly ever exercise  .  i usually just watch tv in my free time  .  i guess i m a real couch potato ! 
i don t believe we ve met  .  
 no   _comma_   i don t think we have  .  
 my name is gao run  .  
 how do you do ? my name is james green  .  
 here s my name card  .  
 and here s mine  .  
 it s nice to finally meet you  .  
 and i m glad to meet you   _comma_   too  .  
marketing manager ’ s office  .  can i help you ? 
 mr  .  smith   _comma_   please  .  
 sorry   _comma_   he is out  .  
 what time do you expect him back then ? 
 sorry   _comma_   i am not sure  .  can i take a message ? 
 no   _comma_   thanks  .  i will call back later  .  
 that ’ s fine  .  please call again later  .  
 ok  .  thank you  .  goodbye  .

 yes   _comma_   i need some traveler s checks  .  
 how much do you need ?

 yes   _comma_   here you go  .  
 what amounts do you want the checks in ? 
 it s all the same to me  .  
 here you are  .  
 thanks  .  
the plumbing in my new apartment is not working  .  
 i need you to tell me what the problem is  .  
 the bathroom sink is stopped up  .  
 is the kitchen plumbing messed up also   _comma_   or just the bathroom plumbing ? 
 just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem  .  
 did this just start happening   _comma_   or has it been going on for a while ? 
 everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago  .  
 are you going to be home so i can come by and take a look at the problem ? 
 i am not sure if i will be home later  .  
 i will be coming by around    this morning  .  if you aren ’ t there   _comma_   i ’ ll just use my key  .  
grand theft auto three is awesome ! 
 it s more violent than tv news ! 
 what time is it anyway ? 
 nine thirty  .  
 oh    _comma_    my god    _comma_    three hours already ! i have to get the chores done ! 
 no time  .  that s their headlights in the window ! 
 ok   _comma_   emergency measures  .  let s throw the dishes in the trash ! two birds with one stone  .  
 little dude   _comma_   your life is over ! 
 no time to worry  .  we have to dispose of this evidence  .  
how old is keith ? 
 he s     .  how old is james ? 
 he s a year older than keith   _comma_   but he looks younger  .  
 how s your father ? 
 he s fine  .  he retired last week  .  it s a turning point in his life  .  now he can relax and enjoy his retirement  .  
 he can spend more time with his grandchildren  .  
 oh   _comma_   i don t think he wants to  .  he wants to travel to several different countries around the world  .  
 so   _comma_   he wants to have a more active retirement  .  good idea ! 
 how do you want to spend your old age ? 
 in the same way   _comma_   probably  .  
could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before i send it out to the human resources department ? 
 sure       _comma_       let me take a look  .  personal information       _comma_       education       _comma_       experience       _comma_       training  .  i think you should add another section for language  .  you speak three languages       _comma_       so you might as well put that on your resume  .  
 but languages don t have anything to do with engineering  .  shouldn t everything i put on my resume have something to do with my field ? 
 not necessarily  .  i think people would be impressed by your language abilities  .  it says something about your level of intellect and experience  .  also   _comma_   i think human resources directors want to see more of a well rounded person in a resume  .  
 it s just a piece of paper   _comma_   you think that they can tell if i am a well rounded person by looking at it ? 
 well    _comma_    you re right    _comma_    the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person  .  that s why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can t see from a piece of paper  .  but resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer  .  
why not come over to work in my company ? 
 i need to think it over  .  
 tell me what you need  .  
 all right  .  i m prepared to   _comma_   if the pay is reasonable  .  
we are approaching the top of the mountain  .  
 what a beautiful view we have here  .  
 yes   _comma_   you can have a bird s eye view of the whole city  .  
 wonderful  .  will we have any free time there ? 
 of course  .  we will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business  .  
what did you do last night ? 
 i just stayed at home and watched tv  .  
 did you watch the barcelona versus madrid game ? 
 yes   _comma_   it was a very evenly matched game  .  
 what were the results of the game ? 
 it ended in a tie  .  
 what was the actual score ? 
 it was three all  .  
 really ? i thought barcelona was going to win  .  they are a much better team than madrid  .  
 if barcelona had played as they normally do   _comma_   they should have won  .  
 what happened ? 
 their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal   _comma_   but he kept on playing anyway  .  
 that explains it  .  
 how many more games are left this season ? 
 that was the last game before the playoffs  .  
 when do the playoffs start ? 
 in a few weeks  .  are you planning on watching them ? 
 of course ! i really love watching football games on tv  .  
 me   _comma_   too ! do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? i m planning on having a few people over to watch it together  .  
 sure   _comma_   that would be great  .  
 ok   _comma_   it s a date then ! 
how are you ? 
 i ’ m fine   _comma_   thanks  .  just trying to get adjusted  .  it ’ s hard to keep track of everything around here  .  
 that ’ s for sure  .  you ’ re new    _comma_    too    _comma_    huh ? 
 yeah  .  i just got here a couple of days ago  .  how about you ? 
excuse me  .  i bought this shirt yesterday   _comma_   but i would like to refund it  .  
 gave me the receipt   _comma_   please  .  
 here is my receipt  .  
 what s wrong with it ? 
 it s too small for me to wear  .  
 would you like another bigger one ? 
 no thanks  .  i want to have a refund  .  
 ok   _comma_   here is your money  .  
oh   _comma_   so many kinds of winter hats  .  
 what is your favorite color   _comma_   miss ? 
 red  .  
 here you are . it   s very attractive  .  
 may i try it on ? 
 go ahead  .  
 is there a mirror around here ? 
 right over there  .  
 does it suit me ? 
 yes   _comma_   you look very nice  .  
 how much is it ? 
 we re having a clearance sale  .      plus tax  .  
 that s quite reasonable  .  
what can i help you with ? 
 may i ask you something ? 
 what s your question ? 
 how many hours behind the wheel do i need ? 
 what do you need to take it for ? 
 i m trying to get my license  .  
 you need six hours  .  
 can i do all six hours in one day ? 
 you have to do it in three days  .  
 that s all i have to do ? 
 that s everything  .  
 well   _comma_   that s a relief  .  
excuse me   _comma_   i have something to trouble you  .  
 yes ? i ll be very glad if i could be of any help to you  .  
 an hour ago   _comma_   i bought this vase with my tourist  .  
 oh   _comma_   yes  .  i remember it clearly  .  is there anything wrong with it ? 
 i m afraid so  .  we found this crack on the bottom when i went back to my hotel  .  
 oh     _comma_     how awful ! let me have a look     _comma_     i m terribly sorry  .  it was most thoughtless of me  .  would you excuse me     _comma_     please ? 
 oh    _comma_    it s quite all right    _comma_    i suppose  .  it can t be helped sometimes  .  
 it s very kind of you to say so  .  how about changing another one for you ? 
 all right  .  thank you  .  
 just a minute   _comma_   please  .  i won t be long  .  i m sure this one is perfect  .  you may examine it carefully  .  
 oh    _comma_    yes    _comma_    it is  .  i ll take this one  .  
 i m very sorry for any inconvenience i ve caused you  .  
 well   _comma_   there s no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing  .  
here you are  .  you left the medicine here  .  
 sorry  .  i was too worried  .  
 i firmly believe that you love your brother very much  .  
 absolutely  .  by the way   _comma_   do you sell any traditional chinese medicine ? 
 yes   _comma_   we have some chinese medicine for common cold  .  
 i heard chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure  .  
 it depends  .  it s true that you can take some for prevention  .  
what kind of place shall we rent ? 
 it should be close to the university  .  neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is   _comma_   the later we can get up  .  
 absolutely  .  that s the most important thing to take into consideration  .  i m not too worried about the size of the flat  .  
 neither am i  .  so a small place is ok   _comma_   but we ll get a bigger one if it s not expensive  .  do you mind if it s in a noisy area ? 
 i don t mind  .  i m not a light sleeper   _comma_   but quieter is better for when we have to study at home  .  
 good point  .  ok   _comma_   let s go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us  .  
 yes   _comma_   if we re lucky we ll find something in the next few days  .  i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early  .  
 how much do you think the rent will be ? 
 i asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month  .  
i have a terrible toothache  .  
 which tooth is it ? 
 this one here  .  
 ar   _comma_   yes  .  there ’ s a big cavity  .  
 can you fill it ? 
 i ’ m afraid not  .  the tooth is too far gone  .  it ll have to be taken out  .  
 then i might as well have it done now  .  
 you ’ d better wait   _comma_   the gums are swollen  .  take the medicine i prescribe and come back in three days  .  
may i have a look at that vase   _comma_   please ? 
 of course  .  it s the best one i have here   and it s only     yuan  .  
 oh     _comma_     it s really nice     _comma_     but to tell the truth     _comma_     that s far too expensive  .  
 really ? even for such an excellent one ? 
can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ? 
 the local newspaper has ads for housing  .  
 is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ? 
 sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate  .  
 what do landlords charge for rent ? 
 would you like an apartment for just yourself   _comma_   or do you need it for two people ? 
 there are two of us   _comma_   but we only need a one bedroom apartment  .  
 you should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month  .  
 i really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me  .  
 sure   _comma_   i ’ ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want  .

 no problem  .  
the product s selling points is its advanced technoledge  .  
 unfortunately   _comma_   it s just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford  .  
 why is the price so high ? 
 it s not just that the price is high   _comma_   it s that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly  .  
 model of computers aren t compatible ? 
 most current computer systems simply can t handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities  .  
 maybe after the next generation of technology comes out   _comma_   the price of this model will become more affordable  .  
 but by then   _comma_   the technology will be outdated  .  
 true      _comma_      but our focus has never been affordability anyway  .  coastwise      _comma_      we may not be very competitive      _comma_      but qualitywise      _comma_      we definitely have an edge  .  
 that s right   _comma_   no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable  .  
 this model has advanced technoledge     _comma_     superior components     _comma_     it is compact     _comma_     and it s a top quality product  .  
 i guess you get what you pay for  .  
what kind of permanent would you like to have ? 
 what kinds do you have ? 
 oh       _comma_       yeah       _comma_       it ’ s quite of variety  .  regular       _comma_       cold perm       _comma_       straight perm       _comma_       pink curl and form  .

 well    _comma_    you can take the no  .     bus from here    _comma_    but then you have to walk about    minutes  .

 yeah   _comma_   i guess so  .  maybe i can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow  .

 i know you re right  .  school is more important than tv  .  can i watch one more show   _comma_   then go to bed  .

yes   _comma_   madam ? can i help you ? 
 oh     _comma_     yes     _comma_     please  .  but you are just closing     _comma_     aren t you ? 
 well     _comma_     yes     _comma_     we are     _comma_     madam  .  the shop shuts down in five minutes  .  
 i shall not keep you long then  .  it was about some saucepans you had in your window last week  .  
 last week   _comma_   madam ? i really can t remember which ones you mean  .  what were they like ? 
 oh         _comma_         they were lovely  .  sort of imitation wood         _comma_         dark brown color         _comma_         country style you know         _comma_         and the lids         _comma_         if i remember rightly         _comma_         they had a sort of leaf pattern         _comma_         or was it flowers ? 
 that s strange  .  i don t recognize any of the ones we had from that description  .  are you sure they were in this shop ? 
 oh    _comma_    you must know the ones i mean  .  they were on sale    _comma_    a real bargain  .  reduced to a quarter of the original price  .  i couldn t believe my eyes when i saw them  .  
 i am afraid the sales are over now   _comma_   madam  .  and you know we all sold out of the saucepans  .  
 i don t think you did   _comma_   you know  .  my neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday  .  
 well   _comma_   it s all new stock in the window now  .  
 may i just have a look   _comma_   to see if there is anything else ? 
 eh     _comma_     well     _comma_     madam     _comma_     as you know we are closing  .  
 yes    _comma_    yes    _comma_    i am sorry i won t keep you  .  it must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time  .  but they were such beautiful saucepans  .  i ’ d have bought them if i had made up my mind on the spot  .  
 perhaps madam    _comma_    if you come back tomorrow    _comma_    i could show you the whole range of kitchen ware  .  and there are still one or two things at the sale price  .  
 oh   _comma_   look ! that was the one there  .  that is the sort of thing i was looking for  .  but it s not quite the color  .  
 that might be the artificial lighting     _comma_     madam  .  of course     _comma_     if you could come back in daylight     _comma_     you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for  .  
 there it is  .  that is the pattern ! the set behind you  .  thank goodness    _comma_    they haven t been sold  .  and thank you so much for being so patient with me  .  yes    _comma_    those are the ones  .  
i ve come to hear about your offer  .  
 we have the offer ready for you  .  let me check  .     boxes with    brooches per box         _comma_         at           _comma_            yuan ;    boxes with    waistbands per box         _comma_         at           _comma_            yuan ;    boxes with other ornaments per box         _comma_         at           _comma_             yuan         _comma_         for shipment in june  .  the offer is valid for five days  .  
 i can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected  .  
 you know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years  .  the prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where  .  
 i am afraid i can t agree with you there  .  i must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we ve received from other companies  .  
 but you must take the design and quality into consideration  .  you know we are superior to others in design and quality  .  we have various styles   _comma_   which the other companies cannot catch up with  .  
 i agree that yours are of the top  .  
 well    _comma_    since your order is large enough    _comma_    can you give me a rough idea ? 
 to have this business concluded   _comma_   i should say a reduction of least    % would help  .  
 impossible  .  how about   % off ? 
 right  .  a reduction of   % is acceptable  .  
so i m on the fifth floor ? how come this hotel has no fourth floor  .  
 four is an unlucky number here   _comma_   peter . four sounds like death in chinese . hotels often have no fourth floor  .  
 i see . oh   _comma_   i know what i wanted to ask . how much should i tip this guy ? 
 people don t usually tip here   _comma_   but you can . fifty dollars should be more enough  .

 ok   _comma_   i will get one for your . here you are  .  
 but it is too loose . do you have the smaller size ? 
 sorry   _comma_   it had been sold out  .  
 what a pity ! 
i ’ d like to apply for a personal loan  .  
 how much would you like to borrow ? 
 a thousand dollars  .  
 let me check with a credit manager  .  a record show your credit reading is quite high  .  i don t think you have any problems  .  
 what ’ s the current interest rate ? 
 our monthly interest is   .   % of the outstanding balance  .  would you please fill out the application the form ? 
and there s a little upside down dilbert on the underside  .  
 when you flip the tie up   _comma_   he s right side up  .  brilliant  .  
 my dad will love this  .  he s a dilbert fan  .  
 i wouldn t mind having one myself  .  
 model it for me  .  
 ok ! 
 wow ! you look just as dorky as dilbert ! 
welcome  .  what can i do for you   _comma_   madam ? 
 i hope you can give me some advice  .  i m sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills  .  it s such a long way from my home   _comma_   but i checked and you are my nearest branch  .  is there anyway i can do it from home ? 
 that s terrible  .  unfortunately   _comma_   we don t have that many branches outside the centre of town  .  what i d advise you to do is set up a direct debit service  .  
 a direct debit service ? what s that exactly ? 
 a direct debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account    _comma_    no fuss    _comma_    no hassle  .  
 but how will you know how much i should pay ? i mean    _comma_    i receive my bills    _comma_    not you  .  
 we set up an agreement with the     _comma_     say     _comma_     phone company  .  they tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account  .  of course     _comma_     we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies  .  
 i see  .  so    _comma_    that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? that does sound like a good idea    _comma_    totally trouble free  .  
hello  .  
 hi  .  it ’ s tony calling from the dentist ’ s office  .  is lily there ?

               .  
 thanks  .  and your name is tony   _comma_   right ? 
 yes  .  i ’ m tony  .  thank you very much  .  
 you ’ re welcome  .  bye  .  
 bye  .  
so what do you think of my new dress ? 
 i think it s great ! i really like the color    _comma_    and it goes really well with your eyes  .  i ve actually been eyeing that dress at maxine s for a while now    _comma_    but i wasn t sure i could afford ninety five dollars for a dress at the moment  .  
 um   _comma_   ninety five dollars ? 
 yes    _comma_    that s the price they were advertising it at  .  i was hoping it might go on sale soon  .  why    _comma_    how much did you pay for it ? 
 i bought it for one hundred and forty five dollars at helen s boutique  .  i didn t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else  .  
 of course ! everything at helen s is overpriced   _comma_   and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! why didn t you shop around ? 
 i don t know   _comma_   i just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much i wanted it  .  i guess i was too impulsive  .  
who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ? 
 i did  .  why ? 
 didn t you know dogs shouldn t eat cooked chicken bones because they re bad for their stomachs ? 
 no   _comma_   i didn t  .  i m sorry  .  it won t happen again  .  
is it fred s fault ? 
 no   _comma_   i don t suppose he s to blame . the man in the other car made a mistake  .  
 but he s equally responsible because he tried to overtake you  .  
in foreign trade   _comma_   exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner  .  
 how to adjust ? 
 exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers   needs   _comma_   wants and likes  .  
 ah    _comma_    some products are successful at home    _comma_    but not be popular overseas  .  
 that s because the fashion   _comma_   taste and social customs and so on vary considerably  .  
 yes   _comma_   sometimes the differences are great  .  
 well   _comma_   we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product  .  
 we have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales  .  
i hate doing the damn laundry  .  
 watch your language  .  
i want to buy three tickets  .  what s the entrance fee ? 
      per person  .

 thanks a lot  .

 where are you heading now ? 
 i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house  .  
 is that the university next to the teachers   college ? 
 that s the one  .  
 you mean we ll share the taxi ? 
 yeah . if we share the cab   _comma_   it ll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully  .  
 well . don   t worry about it   _comma_   i will be happy to share the taxi with you  .

 twenty  .  
 hum   _comma_   still a student ? 
 yes   _comma_   i m student of grade   in the university majoring in economics  .  
 what subjects are you studying ? 
 english     _comma_     math     _comma_     commercial and legal studies     _comma_     and accountancy  .  
 have you had any working experience  .  
 well   _comma_   i worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays  .  
 what do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 i like sports very much . besides that   _comma_   i also like working on a computer in my spare time  .  
 how are your english and computer skills ? 
 i have passed the cet     and   . as far as computer is concerned i can use the computer for word processing  .  
 okay  .  mr . liu   _comma_   we ll inform you of the results within a week  .  
that dress is very pretty  .  why don ’ t you like it ? 
 it ’ s too loud  .  
 we ’ ve been looking around for many hours . what on earth are you looking for ? 
 well    _comma_    you know    _comma_    those styles or colors don ’ t suit me  .  
 what style do you want ? 
 i want to buy a v neck checked sweater   _comma_   and it should be tight  .  
 oh   _comma_   i see . how about the color ? 
 quiet color  .  
 i know a shop selling this kind of sweaters  .  
 really ? let ’ s go there  .  
hey julie   _comma_   you want to go grab something to eat ? 
 sure ! what do you feel like having ? 
 i really feel like having a big juicy steak ! 
 oh  .  ok  .  i don t eat meat    _comma_    but that s fine    _comma_    i am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ? 
 i didn t know you were a vegetarian ! 
 i m not   _comma_   i am a vegan  .  
 a what ? 
 a vegan  .  i don t eat or use any animal based products  .  i don t wear leather      _comma_      eat eggs      _comma_      drink milk or anything that comes from an animal  .  i used to be a pescatarian before      _comma_      which basically means you don t eat meat      _comma_      but still have fish and seafood  .  
 wow ! that s interesting ! it must be tough ! 
 it s a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes    _comma_    but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays    _comma_    it s getting a bit less difficult  .  
how do you feel about that restaurant ? 
 it wasn t all that great  .  
 what did you dislike the most ? 
 i don t think that they had their act together  .  they didn t seem well prepared  .  
 did you think that the food was any good ? 
 i wasn t all that impressed by the food  .  
 the service certainly could have been better  .  
 the service did not help the situation  .  
 is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ? 
 i am not interested in trying this restaurant again  .  
let me see your passport  .  is london your final destination ? 
 no  .  i am a transit passenger going to sweden  .  
 how long are you going to stay here ? 
 only one night  .  
 do you have any dutiable items ? 
 no   _comma_   i don t  .  
 what are these ? 
 they are my personal effects  .  
i heard that you finished my home inspection   _comma_   and i was wondering how it went  .  
 first of all   _comma_   we need to understand what i was looking for  .  do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ? 
 i am not sure what a home inspection is all about  .  
 i went there to check for problems with the home   _comma_   so you aren ’ t surprised when you move in  .  
 wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ? 
 sellers aren ’ t always truthful   _comma_   and there might also be problems that they aren ’ t aware of  .  
 can i require the owners to fix the problems ? 
 you can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems  .  
 what did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ? 
 there were no major problems  .  one leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that i found  .  
how you celebrate your valentine ’ s day with your wife ? 
 i will take a rain check  .  
yesterday i had a quarrel with my roommate  .  i m really fed up with all this  .  
 tell me what seems to be the problem  .  
 my roommate always brings a lot of friends from off campus  .  they stay in the room until midnight    _comma_    singing and talking    _comma_    drinking and playing cards while i have no place for study  .  i even don t have the quietness to sleep  .  
 did you ever talk to him about it ? 
what can i do for you today ? 
 i have a question  .  
 what do you need to know ? 
 i need to take the driver s course  .  how many hours do i need ? 
 it depends on what you re trying to do with the completion of the course  .  
 i need to get my license  .  
 you re going to need to complete six hours  .  
 how many hours a day can i do ? 
 you can do two hours a day for three days  .  
 that s all i need to do to finish ?

 thanks  .  i ll get back to you  .  
would you like your bags to be taken to your room ? 
 yes   _comma_   please  .  
 ok  .  i ll get the bellman to taka them up  .  which bags are yours ? 
 my luggage is in the corner over there  .  they are the leather suitcase   _comma_   the canvass holdall and the blue backpack  .  
 ok  .  
 please be careful with the suitcase   _comma_   it s very heavy  .  
 i ll let the bellboy know  .  don t worry   _comma_   he s very strong  .  
 and the holdall has some fragile items inside   _comma_   so please be careful with that too  .  
 of course  .  
how far do we have to go ? 
 about    miles  .  
 the traffic is not very heavy on this high way   _comma_   is it ? so i ’ m sure we ’ ll make it  .  
 no   _comma_   but we ’ ve got a hurry  .  it will be the rush hour soon  .  
 don ’ t worry  .  there ’ s plenty of time yet  .

good afternoon   _comma_   sir  .  have you made a reservation ? 
 i am afraid not  .  are there any vacant tables ?

 that s all right  .  
i am calling to consult you about the job as a copywriter  .

 i ll get the flour out  .  
 let me help you  .  
we have made some adjustment on the prices  .  and this is renewed price list  .  
 thank you for allowing us   % reduction   _comma_   but still we find your price is on the high side  .  
 this is our rock bottom price   _comma_   and we can t make any further reduction  .  
 if so   _comma_   we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks  .  
 then what ’ s your counter offer ? 
 this is our counter offer  .  
 we are sincere to make business with you   _comma_   but the difference between your counter offer and our price is too great  .  
 so are we  .  our counter offer is in line with the world market  .  
 how about meeting each other half way in order to conclude the business ? 
 agreed  .  
what do you usually have for breakfast ? pancakes or waffles ? 
 i usually have cereal for breakfast  .  
 but isn t it served with cold milk ? 
 yeah  .  cold milk wakes me up  .  
 chinese people don t like to eat cold food  .  
 is that right ? 
 but i m open to new things  .  i ll have a bowl of cereal   _comma_   too  .  
 with cold milk ? 
 with cold milk ! 
i am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful  .  we just made a record sale this season  .  
 that is very encouraging news  .  i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research    _comma_    they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month  .  that is to say    _comma_    the r & d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market  .  
 it is not an easy job  .  how do you like the advertisement for the new product ? 
 that is the best one i have seen  .  i am sure our target customers   _comma_   young people will love it  .  
 certainly  .  
hi   _comma_   i need to copy something right now  .  
 our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine   _comma_   sir  .  
 great ! how much per copy ? 
 sir   _comma_   one copy is ten cents  .  
 okay   _comma_   i ll be down there shortly  .  
 you probably won t have to wait for anyone   _comma_   sir  .  
hi   _comma_   ellen  .  that outfit looks terrific ! 
 thanks   _comma_   jim  .  i didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that  .  
 no   _comma_   we just don ’ t usually admit it ! 
 well   _comma_   thanks for the compliment anyway ! 
this olympic park is so big ! 
 yes  .  now we are in the olympic stadium   _comma_   the center of this park  .  
 splendid ! when is it gonna be finished ? 
 the whole stadium is to be finished this june  .  
 how many seats are there in the stand ? 
 oh   _comma_   there are      seats in total  .  
 i didn ’ t know it would be so big ! 
 it is ! look there   _comma_   those are the tracks  .  and the jumping pit is over there  .  
 ah  .  i see  .  hey    _comma_    look the sign here    _comma_    no climbing  .  
 we put many signs with english translations for foreign visitors  .  
it s located in the suburbs ? well even though that sounds like a steal   _comma_   i really want something downtown  .  
 ok  .  well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive  .  
 i know   _comma_   that s my problem  .  what do you think i should do ? 
 well   _comma_   maybe you could get a two bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate  .  
 oh   _comma_   great idea ! 
so    _comma_    monica    _comma_    how do you like your new office ? 
 well    _comma_    i love it  .  the room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine  .  there are plants along the corridor  .  especially    _comma_    i got my own desk with computer and telephone  .  such a great place ! 
 that ’ s very good  .  i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful  .  
 what was so bad about it ? 
 small rooms    _comma_    small window    _comma_    a small desk shared by three people  .  i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work  .  
 sounds bad ! lucky you ! you didn ’ t take that job  .  i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently  .  
 totally agree  .  by the way   _comma_   the number of the telephone on your desk is extension      .  you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor  .  
now   _comma_   if i look here i see that you completed a ba in english ? 
 yes    _comma_    that ’ s right  .  after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk  .  my major was english    _comma_    and my minor was business studies  .  i completed my ba in       .  
 yes   _comma_   i ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction  .  
 yes that ’ s right  .  i ’ ve always enjoyed studying  .  my friends say i ’ m a bit of a bookworm   _comma_   but my father always pushed us to succeed academically  .  
 well   _comma_   it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca  .  so how about extracurricular activities at university ? 
 well i ’ ve always been keen on writing     _comma_     so i became the editor for the university student magazine     _comma_     which i really loved  .  also i volunteered for a group called shelter     _comma_     to help the homeless in york  .  
 what did that involve ? 
 providing warm meals and shelter   _comma_   especially in the winter months  .  i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group  .  
 i ’ m sure  .  okay    _comma_    now let ’ s move on to your work experience    _comma_    shall we ? 
 yes   _comma_   okay  .  
could you change these for me   _comma_   please ? 
 what would you like ? 
 twenties and some smaller bills   _comma_   please  .  
 anything else ? 
 yes  .  could you tell many balance ? here s account number  .  
now   _comma_   what seems to be the trouble ? 
 it s nothing serious  .  but i always have a headache   _comma_   and i haven t slept properly for several weeks  .  i ve also lost appetite and my eyes are burning  .  
 mm      _comma_      you do look rather pale  .  let me take your temperature  .  would you put the thermometer under your arm      _comma_      please ? now      _comma_      let me listen to your pulse  .  mm      _comma_      do you feel weak ? 
 yes   _comma_   i never seem to have any energy  .  
 i ll give you a blood test  .  would you roll up your sleeve ? just as i thought  .  you re anemic  .  you d better pay more attention to your diet  .  eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein  .  and don t stay up late working  .  try to get more rest  .  
 thank you  .  
excuse me   _comma_   i would like to know something about this campus  .  right now it seems very big and confusing ! i have no idea where i am going or what i am doing  .  
 do you have a map of the campus ? 
 yes    _comma_    i have    _comma_    but it doesn ’ t help me very much  .  i ’ m not very good at reading maps  .  
 do you know where your classes are ? 
 more or less  .  i go to three different buildings   _comma_   and always get there late  .  i feel so hopeless  .  i don ’ t know why i am late all the time  .  no one else seems to be  .  
 that s because you don t know the short cuts  .  you ll learn them after a while  .  i can show you the ropes  .  
good morning   _comma_   i would like to reserve a berth  .  
 which train do you like ? 
 t    to washington please  .  
 may i have your name ? 
 that s lincoln  .  
will you be voting ? 
 i can ’ t wait to vote  .  
 who are you voting for ? 
 the person i ’ m voting for is the best  .  
 what do you like about him ? 
 he is very intelligent  .  
 you think so ? 
 that ’ s right  .  plus   _comma_   i agree with his policies  .  
 i ’ m glad to hear that you are so excited  .  
 i ’ m voting for the next president  .  
 i ’ m sure he will be  .  
 i ’ m going to make sure and vote  .  
good morning  .  may i help you ? 
 yes    _comma_    i d like to check out now  .  my name s adams    _comma_    room      .  here s the key  .  
 one moment    _comma_    please    _comma_    sir  .   .  here s your bill  .  would you like to check and see if the amount is correct ? 
 what s the    pounds for ? 
 that s for the phone calls you made from your room  .  
 can i pay with traveller s cheques ? 
 certainly  .  may i have your passport   _comma_   please ? 
 here you are  .  
 could you sign each cheque here for me ? 
 sure  .  
 here are your receipt and your change   _comma_   sir  .  thank you  .  
 thank you  .  goodbye  .  
what type of people do you work with most effectively ? 
 i tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward . it   s more difficult for me to be around timid people   _comma_   because i move quickly and i am decisive  .  
 what things impress you in your colleagues ? 
 i admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity  .  i also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment  .  
 what are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? 
 the only thing i really don t like is to get feedback in front of others  .  i want to hear good and bad feedback in private   _comma_   so that i have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions  .  i believe that s the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior  .  
 how do you organize and plan for major projects ? 
 i love to brainstorm a best     _comma_     worst     _comma_     and most likely scenario . then     _comma_     i set a timetable that s realistic . what i usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because i ve already visualized what could happen and how i d react  .  
 describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure  .  
 i had to complete an end of quarter report once while i was on the road for two consecutive weeks . the amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible    _comma_    because i could t bring my office files with me . luckily i had a great secretary and a logical filling system    _comma_    so we located everything we needed  .  
 how do you manage your time in a typical day ? 
 i ve always given priority to work with established clients     _comma_     because they offer a better risk   return value . the last thing i do is general correspondence     _comma_     especially internal correspondence     _comma_     which i take care of at the end of the day or week  .  
 describe a time when you acted on someone s suggestion  .  
 i changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings  .  
did you get bean s ten different good luck forwards   _comma_   like that one from the dalai lama ? 
 yeah   _comma_   i deleted all that superstitious crap  .  what a waste of bandwidth ! 
 i figured i might as well send one or two of them out  .  maybe my luck will get better  .  
 do you really think the dalai lama sent that ? i m tired of all these forwards  .  
 it s worth a shot  .  maybe we ll get some luck in thinking up something for this case  .  
i am sorry to have kept all of you waiting  .  i was delayed by something urgent  .  
 you are not late   _comma_   mr  .  thomas  .  there re still    minutes to go  .  mr  .  white has just called you  .  
 what did he say ? 
 he said there was a traffic jam   _comma_   but he is coming  .  
 he shouldn t drive his car  .  he should come here by bus  .  
want to send out for some chinese ? 
 some what ? 
 some chinese food  .  i m hungry   _comma_   and there s a take out restaurant near here  .  we can have them deliver and then watch the news on tv while we eat  .  
 no    _comma_    i d rather go out  .  the chinese food here is rather different from what i had at home  .  maybe we can try some other food today  .  what about that all you can eat place we passed the other day    _comma_    the one over in the shopping center ? 
 okay  .  i could go for that  .  it s called al s steakhouse  .  they also have great fried fish   _comma_   and i love their salad bar  .  you can go back to refill your plate as often as you like  .  
 is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ? 
 yes   _comma_   their steaks are enormous  .  sometimes i can t finish what i ve ordered  .  
 what if that happens to me ? i hate to let food go to waste  .  
 don t worry  .  we ll just get a doggie bag  .  
do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ? 
 i know something about it  .  our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills  .  
 it takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures   _comma_   so i can not bear it anymore  .  it is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills  .  
 is that true ? 
 definitely ! 
 if that information is exact   _comma_   i guess our company is willing to promote someone  .  
hello sir   _comma_   how may i help you ? 
 i would like to buy some flowers   _comma_   please  .  something really nice  .  
 i see   _comma_   may i ask what the occasion is ? 
 it ’ s not really an occasion   _comma_   it ’ s more like i ’ m sorry  .  
 very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends  .  it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out  .  it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness  .  
 i think i ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear  .  what else do you recommend ? 
 mmm    _comma_    well this is our i ’ m sorry i cheated on you package  .  two dozen red roses lined with tulips    _comma_    carnations and lilies  .  the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you  .  
 i don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it  .  i need something bigger and better ! 
 i ’ m sorry sir but   _comma_   what exactly did you do ? 
 well   _comma_   i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier  .  
 get out of my store   _comma_   you jerk ! 
i have to get to chicago by tomorrow and you re telling me that there are no flights ? 
 i m very sorry    _comma_    sir  .  i could put you on a waiting list    _comma_    but you would be wise to check out other means of travel  .  
 you mean like a bus ? have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ? 
 i have not sir  .  but i do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to chicago every hour from here  .  
 alright   _comma_   give me the number  .  but put me on that waiting list as well  .  
 here is the number   _comma_   and your name is on the waiting list  .  
 how many people are on the waiting list right now ? 
 right now i show that there are     people on the list  .  and you are number      .  
how do you think they could be ended ? 
 i don t think that there is any easy way  .  the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country  .  at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate  .  
 so     _comma_     if the cause is poverty     _comma_     there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources     _comma_     share them  .  
 it sounds easy when you say it like that  .  in reality   _comma_   it s harder to make peace between countries  .  
 yes   _comma_   it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support  .  wars are very expensive  .  
you still have not given me those files i ’ ve asked you for  .  
 i ’ m sorry   _comma_   mr  .  myers  .  i ’ ve just been so busy today  .  
 i really don ’ t want to hear your excuses   _comma_   janet  .  we ’ re running a busy office here  .  you ’ re going to have to keep up  .  
 you ’ re right   _comma_   sir  .  i apologize  .  i ’ ll get those files for you now  .  
what sort of job would you like to take ? 
 i prefer a sedentary job and i used to work as an operator  .  
 we need an operator now  .  
 it s just the job i ve been searching for  .  
i wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other s past  .  
 i know  .  it really makes a mess of the whole election process  .  
 and it takes up all the news  .  
 the problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up  .  
 it s so small  .  the fact that there is public interest   _comma_   doesn t say much for us as the public  .  
 have you ever listened to am radio ? it s quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on tv and fm radio  .  
 i don t remember the last time i listened to am radio  .  
 another place you can get real insight is european papers  .  you can get them on line  .  
hello    _comma_    miss wu    _comma_    this is dan robson calling from otc limited  .  i d like to check my last order  .  when exactly was it sent out ? 
 i can check that for you right now  .  would you mind holding ? 
 sure  .  no problem  .  
 mr  .  robson   _comma_   i m sorry  .  our computer system is down  .  could i call you back later ? 
 sure  .  do you have my number ? 
 yes   _comma_   i have it right here  .  i m so sorry about this  .  
 no problem  .  i ll wait for your call  .  
what are you typing there ? 
 i m working on my resume  .  
 really ? did you find any information about a new job ? 
 yeah   _comma_   i just got some good information off the internet  .  
 great ! do you think you have a chance at getting the job ? 
 i didn ’ t just find out about one job  .  there were several ones that looked good  .  
 maybe i should try looking on the web for work  .  
 sure you have to be patient  .  but i think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls  .  
 but there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net  .  you might have no chance  .  
 how do you know if you don ’ t have a try ? 
would you please show me the necklace in the window ? 
 is this the one you want ? 
 no   _comma_   the one next to it  .  
 here you are  .  
 thanks  .  what kind of stone is this ? 
 it s a ruby  .  it is from south africa  .  would you like to try it on ? 
 yes   _comma_   please  .  how much is it ? 
 it costs        .  
 it looks good  .  ok  .  i ll take it  .  
happy birthday   _comma_   jim ! 
 thank you   _comma_   lisa  .  
 here is a present for you  .  i hope you like it  .  
 oh   _comma_   great ! i love it ! you know i ve been expecting this for a long time  .  
 i m very glad to hear that  .  
 come here   _comma_   let me introduce some friends to you  .  
what s wrong with you ? you look pale  .  
 i m not sure   _comma_   i feel hot and cold  .  
 when did the trouble start ? 
 i was sick most of the night  .  
 it sounds like you are coming down with the flu  .  let me take your temperature  .  
 have i got a high fever ? 
 yes    _comma_    thirty eight point seven  .  do you have a headache    _comma_    chest or throat pain ? 
 yes   _comma_   i have  .  
 now        _comma_        let me have a look at you  .  i d like to listen to your chest  .  now breathe in        _comma_        a deep breath        _comma_        that s it cough        _comma_        now again  .  i want to examine your throat        _comma_        too  .  open wide        _comma_        say   ah       
 aaaaahh   _comma_   aaaaahh  .  
 yes   _comma_   it does look a bit sore  .  let s take an x ray of your chest and give you a few tests  .  
 all right   _comma_   thanks  .  
 the tests showed nothing wrong  .  a slight viral infection  .  
 what shall i do today ? 
 i m giving you some antibiotics and aspirins  .  take an aspirin when you ve got a fever     _comma_     and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours     _comma_     and go home and rest in bed for two days  .  drink plenty of water     _comma_     then you ll feel better  .  here s the prescription  .  
i have to check out today  .  i d like my bill ready by    this morning  .  
 you can be sure of that   _comma_   sir  .  
 thank you  .  
i called hp about my computer  .  
 what did they say ? 
 they said i need a new hard drive  .  
 that s too bad  .  how much is a new one ? 
 it s not too much   _comma_   only about       .  
 plus installation ? 
 no   _comma_   my hard drive is easy to remove and replace  .  
 really ? 
 yes   _comma_   it s just a couple of screws  .  
 that s nice  .  
 it s a lot better than paying someone       .  
 if my hard drive crashes   _comma_   i ll just call you  .  
gosh    _comma_    it s  :      _comma_    i ll miss the first class  .  
 don t get up so late next time  .  you should have gone to bed earlier last night  .  
 yes   _comma_   mum  .  
is there anything wrong ? 
 i ’ m worried about my daughter  .  she can ’ t decide about college  .  
 don ’ t worry  .  that ’ s just a part of being a teenager  .  
 i don ’ t mind that  .  but she disagrees with me about everything  .  
 you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself  .  you shouldn ’ t affect her decision  .  
 but i just want to give her some tips  .  
 oh   _comma_   she can make her own decisions  .  
 i guess you are right  .  
 believe me  .  everything will be ok  .  
 i hope so  .  
it s beautiful here  .  
 yes  .  i feel refreshed  .  
 how long will we dock ? 
 in half an hour  .  the surface of the lake is calm  .  
 yes  .  we come at the right time  .  
that was a really good meal   _comma_   gordon  .  
 it sure was  .  i couldn t eat another bite  .  
 well   _comma_   it is getting pretty late  .  i think we should go home  .  
 you re right  .  i have to get up early to go to work tomorrow  .  
 let s see how much the bill is  .  
 don t worry about it  .  tonight is my treat  .  
 what are you talking about ? we ll split the bill  .  
 no   _comma_   i insist  .  i kept telling you that i would treat you to dinner but i still haven t  .  
 no way   _comma_   gordon  .  i know that you are a little short on cash at the moment  .  there s no need for you to pay for the whole bill  .  
 alright    _comma_    if that s the way you are going to be    _comma_    we ll split the bill  .  
 that s better  .  this way we will both have money to take a cab home    _comma_    otherwise    _comma_    you would probably have to walk  .  
 just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week   _comma_   ok ? 
 you ve got a deal  .  
 great  .  bye  .  
 bye  .  
i hear you are planning to travel abroad  .  
 yes  .  i m going to the untied states for travel  .  what places do you recommend ? 
 in my opinion      _comma_      there are several places you mustn t miss      _comma_      like washington d  .  c      _comma_      las vegas      _comma_      new york and los angeles  .  
 someone suggests that i should go to seattle and hawaii  .  
 yes     _comma_     you may consider those two places also  .  seattle     _comma_     for example     _comma_     is worth visiting and there s a very famous museum called museum of flight  .  
 and seattle is the home of microsoft and boeing  .  that must be a great place  .  i can t miss it  .  
this looks like a very nice house  .  
 you know   _comma_   i fell in love with this house the first moment i laid eyes on it  .  
 the style of the exterior is just what i ’ ve been looking for ! 
 the exterior is only half of the story  .  the interior is incredible  .  
 this home is gorgeous on the inside ! 
 everything that you see on the walls    _comma_    floors    _comma_    and windows is brand new  .  
 the wall colors totally suit the style of this house  .  
 straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen  .  
 i love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops  .  
 the master suite is the best  .  let ’ s go look at that next  .  
 there is plenty of room for our king sized bed   _comma_   and i love the light in this room  .  
 i know that you like this house   _comma_   but let ’ s take a look at the others before you make up your mind  .  
room service . what can i do for you ? 
 l am afraid there isn t any fancy soap in my room  .  
 sorry sir   _comma_   we will bring you one . anything else ? 
 yes . bring me a bath towel as well  .  
good afternoon . british airline . is there any thing i can do for you ? 
 can i make a reservation for flight fw   to san marino ? 
 sure  .  when do you want to take the plane ? 
 next monday  .  
 will that be first class or economy seat ? 
 what s the fare for a first class seat ? 
        .  
 oh  .  i am not a wall streeter . give me an economy one please  .  
hello    _comma_    sir  .  so    _comma_    you are back ? 
 yes   _comma_   hello again  .  i would like to know the exact difference between dividend deposit and dividend participated deposit  .  
 that s pretty easy to explain  .  with the deposit     _comma_     the interest is fixed     _comma_     but the dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year  .  the longer the term     _comma_     the higher the dividend you earn  .  this is because it is calculated at the compound interest rate  .  
 and i can purchase that here ? 
 yes  .  and if you already have a current account with us    _comma_    the insurance premium can be paid through it    _comma_    which saves all of us a lot of hassle  .  
are there any beds vacant ? 
 yes   _comma_   what kind of room do you want ? 
 i prefer one facing the sea  .  besides   _comma_   it should have a shower  .  
 sorry   _comma_   right now we can only have you a room without shower  .  
 well   _comma_   that s fine  .  
welcome to the company  .  we are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company  .  
 that s easy  .  it was your office ergonomics that decided me  .  
 you re kidding ! something as simple as that ? 
 yes  .  it is very important to me  .  my mother worked in offices for twenty years    _comma_    and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome  .  i have been reading about repetitive stress injuries    _comma_    and i know that t 
 yes    _comma_    there has been a lot of research into rsi s  .  something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries  .  tell me    _comma_    did anything else influence your decision ? 
 yes   _comma_   i noticed that you have professional training and team building days  .  i like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff  .  
 well   _comma_   welcome to the team  .  
good afternoon  .  i ve brought the extra blanket you asked for  .  
 oh   _comma_   thank you  .  
 is there anything i can do for you now ? 
 yes  .  i m rather tired and want to go to bed early  .  please make the bed  .  
 certainly   _comma_   sir  .  
lin s office supplies  .  how may i direct your call ? 
 marry lin please  .  
 sure   _comma_   just a moment  .   .  i m sorry no one answer the phone  .  
 all right   _comma_   could i leave a message ? 
 certainly ! 
 please ask her to call john  .  
excuse me  .  where is the way out ? 
 well   _comma_   that s what i m looking for myself  .  
 it s very confusing in here   _comma_   isn t it ? 
 absolutely  .  oh   _comma_   do you see a sign there ? 
 it should be the way out  .  
 ok  .  let s go and see  .  
excuse me    _comma_    i ordered the well done steak    _comma_    but this one is so tough  .  
 well    _comma_    sir    _comma_    i think i have made a mistake  .  i will take it back to the kitchen right now  .  
 i think you should be more careful next time  .  
 yes   _comma_   sir  .  i m really so sorry about that  .  
allan   _comma_   i am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project  .  
 look   _comma_   sally  .  i ’ ve put just as much work into this as anybody else  .  
 no   _comma_   i ’ m sorry  .  i disagree  .  i don ’ t think you ’ ve been working at full speed at all  .  
 well  .  i ’ m sorry you feel that way  .  
hi joe   _comma_   how are you doing today ? 
 things are going good today  .  how have you been doing   _comma_   mary ? 
 things are going well for me   _comma_   joe  .  
 want to go see a movie tonight ? 
 my parents are taking me to dinner tonight  .  
 could you go with me to the movies on friday night   _comma_   instead ? 
 what movie did you want to see ? 
 there is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer  .  
 i was thinking that i would like to see “ the secret life of bees  .  ” 
 oh great ! sounds like something i need to bring kleenex to ! 
how s the bride to be ? 
 tired and stressed  .  this wedding is giving me a headache  .  
 just relax  .  with me as your maid of honor   _comma_   everything will be fine ! 
 i m worried that everything will be chaotic ! 
 hey ! i m the tour guide  .  i ll take care of the taiwanese guests  .  
 you re going to have to tell them what to do in church   _comma_   what everything means  .  
 i will  .  don t worry ! 
jim ? jim ?  .  what are you doing in the kitchen ? 
 nothing   _comma_   mummy  .  i was hungry so i came here for some milk  .  
 milk ? i thought you didn t like milk  .  
 i don t   _comma_   but i couldn t find anything to eat in the refrigerator  .  
 nonsense  .  there s lots of food in the refrigerator  .  what s behind your back ? 
 nothing  .  
 what are you hiding behind your back ? let me see  .  
 promise that you won t get angry  .  
 ok   _comma_   i promise  .  what is it ? 
 it s a kitty  .  
 oh   _comma_   jim  .  i told you  .  no pets  .  it ll make a mess of this house  .  
 please    _comma_    mummy  .  everybody else in my class keeps a pet  .  please    _comma_    i ll take care of it  .  it s a good kitty  .  it ll not bring you any trouble  .  
 no way  .  it might belong to somebody else  .  you can t keep it here  .  
 please    _comma_    mummy  .  i found it this afternoon by the garbage bin  .  it was starving and looking for something to eat  .  please ! you see    _comma_    it s so cute and tame  .  
 all right  .  but you have to clean up everything it messes up  .  
 i will  .  thank you   _comma_   mummy  .  
i was wondering if you could help me with something  .  
 sure   _comma_   anything you say  .  
 actually   _comma_   it ’ s a little bit silly  .  
 don ’ t worry about it   _comma_   just ask  .  
 what words do i need to know to buy a pair of shoes ? 
 you need to know the type of shoes you want  .  
 don ’ t worry about that  .  i can point it out in the store  .  
 the shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable      _comma_      too wide      _comma_      too narrow      _comma_      or just right ; and long or short  .  in girls shoes      _comma_      the heel can be high or low  .  
 let me write all that down  .  i ’ m going shopping this afternoon  .  
excuse me  .  how long has it been since the business was founded ? 
 it has been    years since it was founded in       .  
 so   _comma_   it has a history for more than a decade ? 
 yes  .  and it was incorporated with other businesses in      due to the global financial crisis  .  
what can i do for you   _comma_   madam ? 
 can you help me with comprehensive credit granting ? 
 certainly   _comma_   madam  .  what would you like to know ? 
 well   _comma_   everything really  .  
 all right  .  we can grant a financing promise quota      _comma_      if you qualify  .  this means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way  .  firstly      _comma_      your credit rating must be class a      _comma_      and your debt to asset ratio must be top notch      _comma_      for the industry you are involved in  .  
let s do something outdoors today  .  
 all right  .  but i don t want to play tennis  .  we played tennis last weekend  .  
 okay  .  what do you want to do ? 
 i want to go jogging  .  
 all right  .  that sounds like fun  .  
good afternoon  .  i come here specially to pick up my tickets  .  i booked it last month . this is my reservation note  .  
 i am terribly sorry  .  you didn t come to reconfirm recently . you should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it s an international flight   _comma_   any reservation without reconfirmation within    hours will be cancelled  .  
 but i have been so busy all these days . well   _comma_   is there any other ticket available ? i want the next one  .  
the last thing to be ignored at a chinese dinner table is to keep modest  .  
 does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? the same is true in the west  .  
 no        _comma_        absolutely not ! on the contrary        _comma_        you ll be considered a well connected        _comma_        sociable man        _comma_        if you keep involved in the conversation all the time  .  but always pay attention to what you say  .  if the table has a senior guest        _comma_        say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible  .  or maybe        _comma_        you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested  .  
 you mean    _comma_    keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? that goes in like with confucius   preachings    _comma_    right ? 
 correct  .  show respect for the older people  .  conventionally    _comma_    before the meal starts    _comma_    the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one  .  others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite  .  toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other  .  
 any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? 
 yes   _comma_   plenty of them  .  don t eat fast ! people usually keep their dining pace accorded with others  .  and all the dishes should not be eaten up completely  .  
 is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? 
 haha   _comma_   i m afraid it s simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate  .  
our toner cartridges are already out of ink  .  could you make an order for a new set ? 
 we will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? that will be a large order   _comma_   probably about two or three cases  .  the office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock  .  
 you can double check with the housekeeping department     _comma_     but i am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges  .  last time when we made our order to the supplier     _comma_     the quantity was also especially high  .  they are used to receiving such bulk orders from us  .  as long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance     _comma_     they can usually fill the order  .  
 ok   _comma_   i will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure  .  is there anything else we need to order while i am at it ? 
 i think the only thing is toner  .  try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow  .  we should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis  .  anyhow   _comma_   see what you can do to expedite the order this time  .  
 ok   _comma_   will do  .  
i want a pair of sports shoes   _comma_   adidas  .  
 what size do you want ? 
 i wear size     .  
 how about this one ? it s the latest design  .  
 oh   _comma_   i like the color  .  
may i help you ? 
 i m looking for a pair of shoes  .  
 what size do you wear ? these shoes are on sale  .  
 i wear size    . this pair looks nice . can i try them on ? 
 of course   _comma_   yes . they look nice . and they re not expensive  .  
 how much are they ? 
 they are        .  
 i ll take them  .  
a friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days  .  he told me the other day he has learned a lot from it  .  he recommended me to subscribe to it  .  what do you say ? 
 i think it is good if we know enough about career planning  .  we will make wiser choices  .  what else did he tell you about it ? 
 well    _comma_    just something in general    _comma_    like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals  .  
 sounds practical ! to be honest   _comma_   sometimes i feel puzzled about my future career  .  i am not sure if this job suits me the best though i work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker  .  i have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills  .  
 making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do  .  it seems that you need this course more than i do  .  i love my current job  .  if i take this course    _comma_    i hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work  .  if they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships    _comma_    that will be great  .  i need these to improve my current work performance  .  
 ok   _comma_   then we can sign up for it together  .  
who s it knocking at the door ? 
 i think it s the postman . will you go and open the door ? 
 all right  .  i ll get it  .  
good evening  .  welcome to cherry s  .  do you have a reservation ? 
 no   _comma_   we don t  .  
 how many of you   _comma_   please ? 
 six   _comma_   including two kids  .  
 i m afraid all the big tables are taken  .  
hi   _comma_   i think i was supposed to call for my test results today  .  
 if you go onto our website and put in your password   _comma_   you can access your test results  .  
 are you saying that there weren ’ t any problems ? 
 i will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem  .  
 will i be able to read the results on the website and understand them ? 
 yes    _comma_    if you go there    _comma_    you can see what each test is about  .  
 how will i know what the numbers mean ? 
 you can see your results and how they compare to the normal range  .  
 how can i see test results from tests i have taken before ? 
 we put all of your test results up in the same place  .  just check the dates for what you need  .  
this is our rock bottom price   _comma_   mr  .  lee  .  
 if that s the case  .  there s not much point in further discussion  .  we might as well call the whole deal off  .  
 what i mean is that we ll never be able to come down to your price  .  the gap is too great  .  
 i think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible  .  how about meeting each other halfway ? 
 what s your proposal ? 
 your unit price is     dollars higher than we want  .  well   _comma_   i suggest we meet each other halfway  .  
 do you mean a further reduction of    dollars in our price ? that s impossible ! 
 what would you suggest ? 
 the best we can do is another    dollars off  .  that s definitely the lowest we can go  .  
 that still leaves a gap of    dollars  .  let s meet each other half away again and split the difference ; i think this is a price we can both be satisfied with  .  
 ok  .  we can meet halfway again  .  
hello  .  
 good morning   _comma_   ruth  .  did i wake you up ? 
 no    _comma_    i was just about to get up  .  what s up    _comma_    carl ? 
 listen   _comma_   i am calling to confirm what you said yesterday  .  are we supposed to meet at the chinatown terminal of the avenue b bus or d bus ? 
 b as in boy  .  you should get off at the last stop in chinatown  .  
 oh   _comma_   you mean canal street ? 
 that s the wrong direction  .  canal street is on the other side of chinatown  .  
 oh   _comma_   i get it  .  when did we decide to meet ? 
 at     _comma_      .  is ann coming along ? 
 i cannot get hold of her yet  .  
 see you around   _comma_   carl  .  
 see you later  .  
has your company been affected much by government legislation ? 
 yes   _comma_   we have  .  we ve had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards  .  
 what about your use of raw materials ? 
 well   _comma_   we ve had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more  .  
 what happens if you exceed the limits ? 
 we try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine  .  
have you got any better ? 
 that s the best there is  .  
 okay   _comma_   i ll take one  .  
 that ll be         _comma_   sir  .  
good morning   _comma_   sir  .  sorry to disturb you  .  may i make up the room now ? 
 yes    _comma_    please  .  we re on our way out    _comma_    so we put the   make up   sign on  .  could you bring us some towels and hangers ? 
 no problem   _comma_   sir  .  everything will be ready when you come back  .  
what are the factors that have great impact on the perspective of this corporation ? 
 external factors  .  i think the main external factors are political    _comma_    economic    _comma_    social and technological factors  .  
 what are the internal factors that influence the company ? 
 the internal factors are composed of human resources     _comma_     team spirit     _comma_     innovation spirit and coordination between different departments     _comma_     etc  .  
i don ’ t want you to be worried   _comma_   but our son has some bad habits now  .  he says painful words everyday  .  
 what words ? can you tell me ? 
 he says kick mommy       _comma_       beat mommy       _comma_       don ’ t want mommy       _comma_       very quickly if i do something that he doesn ’ t like  .  you know       _comma_       if i wash his face or change his clothes       _comma_       things like that  .  
 honey   _comma_   i don ’ t know what to tell you  .  of course tony is a young child  .  but do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason  .  
 yes   _comma_   but sometimes he is just not reasonable  .  
 i suggest you treat him with patience         _comma_         affection         _comma_         and respect  .  if he needs to do something         _comma_         like go to bed         _comma_         or be washed         _comma_         etc  .          _comma_         please guide or help him to get it done         _comma_         but lead him with gentleness  .  
 it ’ s easy to say   _comma_   but i will try  .  
 motivate tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior  .  do not emphasize punishment for bad moods   _comma_   etc  .  do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire  .  
 i know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him  .  but this doesn ’ t work   _comma_   instead he picks up another bad habit  .  
how can i help you ? 
 yes   _comma_   i am james mason from anderson and associates  .  i would like to see mr  .  smith  .  
 do you have an appointment ? 
 yes   _comma_   he knows i m coming  .  our meeting is set for   o clock  .  
 i wonder if mr  .  smith forgot your meeting  .  i am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after   pm  .  let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place  .  will you please have a seat ? 
 sure  .  
 yes      _comma_      mr  .  mason      _comma_      i just checked with our office manager      _comma_      ms  .  terry      _comma_      she said mr  .  smith briefed her on your project  .  she is just finishing up a meeting now  .  she could be with your shortly  .  would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? 
 that would be very nice  .  thank you  .  
 right this way    _comma_    mr  .  mason  .  we can start with our front office  .  when ms  .  terry is ready    _comma_    you may take the elevator at the front to the  th floor  .  there is a conference room already prepared 
did you watch the oscars on sunday night ? 
 no   _comma_   but i heard about that angelina jolie and brad pitt didn t attend  .  
 yes   _comma_   that was surprising  .  i heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go  .  
 they must be the most famous celebrity couple in hollywood  .  
 they re also one of the richest couples  .  they have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want  .  
 i also heard that tom cruise and katie holmes made an appearance at the oscars  .  
 did either one of them win an oscar this year ? 
 i think tom might have been nominated for one of his films   _comma_   but i don t think he won anything  .  
 tom cruise may be handsome    _comma_    but i think he s a bit crazy    _comma_    don t you ? 
 yes   _comma_   his marriage to katie is actually quite scandalous  .  
 i still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves  .  
 people in show biz can have such an easy life ; i don t know why they have to make it so complicated  .  
 i would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you  .  
 that s true  .  i guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go  .  
 thank goodness we re not rich and famous ! 
 being famous    _comma_    i can do without    _comma_    but i wouldn t mind being rich  .  
next   _comma_   please  .  
 could i purchase euro with rib here ? i have to stay here for months  .  
 yes    _comma_    the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen    _comma_    so you have seen the rate of exchange  .  
 yes   _comma_   i have known of it  .  
 how much do you like to exchange ? 
     _comma_      rib  .  
 in what denominations ? 
 it doesn t matter    _comma_    but leave me some small changes    _comma_    that will be convenient in daily life  .  
 right   _comma_   i will exchange for you now  .  please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone  .  
 well    _comma_    could you change them too ? the dollars    _comma_    i want to change them into swiss francs  .  
 ok       _comma_       wait for a moment  .  well       _comma_       i am sorry       _comma_       but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins  .  in this case       _comma_       you d better change        _comma_            to swiss francs  .  
 it doesn t matter  .  
 please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo  .  
 thanks a lot  .  good bye  .  
why are you holding me in this jail cell ? 
 we d like to hear your account of the events of last night  .  
i have to go up to london for a couple of days next week  .  would you like to come ? 
 that would be nice  .  how are you getting there ? 
 well    _comma_    i prefer to go on the train    _comma_    but i suppose you want me to take the car  .  
 oh    _comma_    i much prefer to go by car    _comma_    then we don t need to get to the station with our luggage and  .  
 and i ve got to drive  .  you know i m not fond of that  .  i found it much more relaxing to sit in the train  .  
 which is more expensive ? 
 but very much quicker  .  but i know we ll never agree on this subject  .  you prefer the car  .  i prefer the train  .  
 now   _comma_   have you ever thought of going by express bus ? 
i want to take a look at that home with the open house flags out front  .  
 what a wonderful neighborhood ! can you find that house on our open house list ? 
 yes   _comma_   that is one of the houses that we have on our list  .  
 they always make the front yards look so great for open houses  .  let ’ s see what the inside looks like  .  
 i am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here  .  
 signing the registry is a good idea  .  i think i want to see the kitchen next  .  
 i really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day  .  
 i need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it  .

 i was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ? 
 i need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper  .  
 ok  .  what about going to the movies on friday night ? 
 what were you planning on seeing ? 
 i was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer  .  
 how about “ the secret life of bees ” ? 
 that s a chick flick ! 
what do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? 
 first     _comma_     i d make sure that we have a good     _comma_     local     _comma_     corporate lawyer  .  he or she will know all the local laws and regulations  .  
 that ’ s very important  .  a friend recommended a good law firm to me  .  we ’ ll need someone to hire staff  .  
 i think that we should send one of our hr people to do that  .  i don ’ t think we should use an agency   _comma_   because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ  .  have we decide on the location of 
 yes  .  we have  .  we chose the location in the northeast of the city   _comma_   not too far from the airport and on the edge of the cbd  .  
 why didn ’ t we choose an office in the cbd ? 
 the offices there were too expensive  .  have we negotiated any contracts yet ? 
 yes  .  we ’ ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries  .  we hope to sign another three this month  .  
 when will the branch office open ? 
 hopefully next month  .  everything is a little rushed  .  we should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly  .  
 has and advertising campaign been prepared ? 
 yes   _comma_   it has  .  we ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines  .  
 i made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy  .  we should be able to get plenty of customers  .  
good afternoon  .  what can i do for you ? 
 i want to pick up my valuables  .  
 may i have your key please ? 
 sure  .  here you are  .  
 here is your valuable  .  is that right ? 
 yes   _comma_   thank you  .  
did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the usa ? 
 why ? i thought americans were supposed to be more open than that  .  
 well    _comma_    for many religious people    _comma_    they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers  .  
 do you think most people in america believe that abortion is wrong ? 
 no   _comma_   i think it s mostly the older generation who are against abortions  .  
 it s no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in america  .  
 religious people blame it on pre marital sex   _comma_   not on abortion being illegal  .  
 what do you think about abortion ? 
 i personally would never want to have one    _comma_    but i think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman s entire life    _comma_    she should have the right to decide for herself  .  
 do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? 
 i know this is going to sound sexist   _comma_   but i don t think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children  .  
 why not ? it s their children   _comma_   too  .  
 that may be true    _comma_    but when a woman gets pregnant    _comma_    it changes her life completely  .  men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand  .  
 that might be true   _comma_   but i think men should have some kind of say in the matter  .  
come to think of it   _comma_   you should get out your english books and catch up on your reading assignments  .  
 but i don t have any reading assignments  .  
 then review for your test  .  you ll do even better  .  and maybe reading will help you get to sleep  .  
 aw   _comma_   mom you re such a drag  .  
 you say that now     _comma_     lily     _comma_     but you ll thank me later  .  i m your mom     _comma_     and mother knows best  .  
i m just calling to see if you have made any decision about the position  .  
 sorry   _comma_   we haven t made the decision at all  .  
 do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision ? 
 we will let you know probably next monday  .  i hope to give you a positive reply  .  
 i m willing to wait until you have come to a decision  .  
how did you find your apartment ? 
 you can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing  .  
 what if i need a roommate ? 
 there are websites that can hook you up with a roommate  .  
 how much do apartments cost around here ? 
 it depends on what you want  .  do you want a one   or two bedroom apartment ? 
 i just need a one bedroom apartment  .  
 that will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month  .  
 would you come with me to look at apartments ? 
 i would be happy to look at apartments with you  .  
have you heard what happened ? 
 heard what ? 
 deborah already had her baby  .  
 i didn t know that  .  
 i thought you knew  .  
 i honestly didn t know  .  
 the baby was   pounds   ounces  .  
 that s good to hear  .  
 will you go and visit them ? 
 of course i will  .  
 i just wanted to give you the good news  .  
 thanks for letting me know  .  
how silly of you to jump out of the window ! 
 but that was the first thing that came into my mind when i heard the shout earthquake ! 
 why not use staircases ? the terror was not so violent at that time  .  
 that would be too late  .  
 maybe the situation is too urgent  .  
 yes   _comma_   i think i should have jumped in any case  .  
i need to stop eating such unhealthy foods  .  
 i know what you mean  .  i ve started eating better myself  .  
 what foods do you eat now ? 
 i tend to stick to fruits    _comma_    vegetables    _comma_    and chicken  .  
 those are the only things you eat ? 
 that s basically what i eat  .  
 why aren t you eating anything else ? 
 well   _comma_   fruits and vegetables are very healthy  .  
 and the chicken ? 
 it s really healthy to eat when you bake it  .  
 i guess that does sound a lot healthier  .  
good morning ! i am a new comer in our office  .  
 good morning ! welcome to our office !

 you are welcome  .  
do you have experience in advertising ? 
 yes   _comma_   i used to have a part time job in advertising company  .  
 what were you mean duties there ? 
 i mostly did advertising planning  .  
 what qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ? 
 i think an advertising planner should have active thoughts    _comma_    creative talent    _comma_    and be sensitive to the changes in the market  .  
 what was the most important thing you have learned at work ? 
 the most important thing i learned was that i must continuously improve my abilities  .  advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success  .  if i want to make in marking in advertising industry   _comma_   i can ’ t stop studying and creating  .  
the air conditioning is not working ! we need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! 
 dan is on top of that  .  i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up  .  
 that would be convenient  .  they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring  .  the circuit breakers keep going out all the time  .  it ’ s really annoying ! 
 yeah you are right  .  this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded  .  
 i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him  .  
do you have anything to do after this ? 
 no   _comma_   i don t  .  
 shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ? 
 that sounds like a good idea  .  
 i know a very interesting place  .  
 oh   _comma_   do you ? good  .  
oh     _comma_     hi     _comma_     jessica     _comma_     are you going to see this movie too ?

 then let s go in  .  
 i can t  .  i m waiting for paul   _comma_   but he s late  .  
 i ll say the movie s starting in the minute  .  
 i know  .  i wonder what s keeping him  .  
 looks like he won t show up  .  he s done this before   _comma_   hasn t he ? 
 yeah   _comma_   a number of times  .  
 what s he trying to pull anyway  .  
 i don t know  .  but this is definitely the last straw  .  
 maybe you should start seeing someone else  .  
 you said it  .  ok    _comma_    let s go in    _comma_    sandy  .  
i can t believe how hot it is  .  
 it s not even noon yet  .  
 that means it will get hotter  .  
 i am dying from the heat  .  
 turn on the air conditioner  .  
 it doesn t work  .  
 what happened ? 
 i don t know  .  
 did you call the repairman ? 
 of course  .

 he s busy  .  he said next week  .

 this dish taste terrific  .  would you like to try a little ? it is a little hot   _comma_   but very good  .

 thank you  .  today i m writing a kind of poem called a chinese couplet  .

 you see    _comma_    this time i traveled to the west  .  when i looked out of the windows of the rain    _comma_    all the lands that i could see are as dry as a bone  .  
 it is serious  .  
i m looking forward to summer vacation  .  
 me too  .  
my granny is such a kind hearted person  .  she is willing to help  .

 you don t really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo   _comma_   do you ? 
 well   _comma_   i have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true ! 
 of course it does ! they tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house  .  i think most of the times they are just scam artists  .  
 well     _comma_     historically it is a practice that many cultures share  .  reading the tarot cards     _comma_     in the east they would even read tea leaves ! i even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar     _comma_     and then read your ashes  .  
 all superstitious nonsense ! i would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say   _comma_   just for kicks  .

 i have no idea  .  
wow ! what a beautiful scenic spot ! it s so open  .  and just breathe that fresh air   _comma_   you can almost taste its freshness  .  
 you can have a bird view of guiling city from the top of the mountain  .  
 wonderful ! i ll often come here for mountain climbing  .  
 you should  .  many guiliners    _comma_    especially the old and the young    _comma_    will climb mountains here in the morning  .  
 no wonder people say 
 quick ! pass me your binoculars  .  look at that bird  .  i ve never seen one of those before  .  it s indigenous to guiling   _comma_   and an endangered species too  .  this is lucky ! 
 i didn t know you liked bird watching  .  
 i don t really  .  i just like wildlife   _comma_   and you don t get to see too much of it in the city  .  this place is full of it  .  
hide me   _comma_   yi jun ! the kids all think i m the real easter bunny !

 some game ! you try being tackled by ten kids at once ! 
 um   _comma_   holly ? look behind you  .  they re coming this way  .  
hi    _comma_    bob    _comma_    i am so glad that you came  .  
 of course i d come  .  i couldn t think of a better chance to see all my old friends  .  
 yeah  .  it s hard to believe that it s been ten years since graduation  .  it feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas  .  
 how time flies  .  but hey   _comma_   how are things going with you ? 
 oh   _comma_   where to start ? there have been ups and downs  .  i m still trying to find my place in this world  .  it s only recently that i ve been able to start settling down  .  how about you ? you still with jenn 
 yeah   _comma_   jenny and i got married right after graduation  .  it was tough the first years trying to make ends meet  .  i was supporting us both while she continued her studies  .  but now things are getting better 
 oh   _comma_   that sounds wonderful  .  i have always known you two would make it  .  i hope i can keep in better contact with you guys  .  i don t want us to drift apart again  .

 sounds great ! i ll be there  .  
i guess i m just a little nervous  .  i m giving everything i have to invoking   _comma_   and  .  
 and what if it doesn t work out   _comma_   right ? 
 exactly  .  
 you need to quit thinking like a loser  .  invoking is going to kick butt  .  you know how i know ? 
 how ? 
 because i won t let it fail  .  
 but what about tomorrow ? what if stars . com decides to go with webtracker   _comma_   and not us ? 
are you ready for the camping trip ? 
 all set  .  i ve got my makeup    _comma_    my cds    _comma_    and my portable tv set  .  
 hello ! we re supposed to be getting back to nature  .  
 yeah   _comma_   yeah  .  anyway  .  i m packed  .  are you ?

 i hope we ll get together again soon  .  
 i hope so  .  a good journey to you ! 
 thank you  .  
i ’ m fed up with marriage  .  
 why do you say so ? everyone admires that you have a good wife  .  
 oh    _comma_    no  .  when we were poor    _comma_    we often tried our best to make ends meet  .  it was a hard time  .  
 but now you are rich  .  
 and we have some squabbles on some boring things  .  
 this is ordinary marriage life  .  
how about you and tom ? what time is your wedding ? 
 don ’ t be kidding   _comma_   ok ? 
 what ’ s the matter ? so angry  .  i ’ m just playing a joke with you  .  
 because i have given him up as a bad job  .  our relation has been over  .  
margaret   _comma_   do you think i should enroll in the science course ? 
 yes     _comma_     i think so     _comma_     if you want to graduated this year     _comma_     you ve got to take a science course  .  
 right    _comma_    i figure since you are doing premedical    _comma_    you know about the very courses  .  
 well     _comma_     i have to take biology     _comma_     chemistry     _comma_     maps and physics . what you need is a good introductory course for non science majors  .  
 yes    _comma_    i really weak in maps    _comma_    i did poorly in high school  .  
 that s a problem  .  
what are you listening to ? is that beethoven or mozart ? 
 it s beethoven  .  do you like it ? 
 i think beethoven s music is incredible  .  i ve heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent   _comma_   too  .  do you believe that ? 
 i don t know about that   _comma_   but i do think that it helps people relax  .  
 what other kind of music do you listen to ? 
 actually   _comma_   i mostly just listen classical music  .  what about you ? 
 to be honest   _comma_   i think classical music is too complicated for me  .  
 what kind of music do you prefer then ? 
 i like pop music  .  do you ? 
 not really  .  i don t think pop music has much depth  .  
 i see what you mean  .  i think that s way i like it so much  .  
 how long have you been in to pop music   _comma_   then ? 
 i ve always been into it  .  have you always liked classical music ? 
 not really  .  when i was little   _comma_   we didn t really listen to music at all  .  
 so   _comma_   how did you become interested in it ? 
 well    _comma_    when i was about    years old    _comma_    i started playing the piano  .  i think that s how it all started  .  
 do you still play piano ? 
 yes   _comma_   it s one of my hobbies  .  
hi paul  .  how are you   _comma_   friend  .  
 not good  .  my cousin is driving me up the wall  .  
 how so ? 
 he stays up untill all hours of the night   _comma_   and he never lifts a finger to help  .  
 have you talk to him about it ? 
 not yet   _comma_   but i have to soon  .  he s eating me out of house and home  .  i caught him reading the fridge again last night 
 ahahah   _comma_   maybe that will help you lose weight  .  
 this is no laughing matter   _comma_   nick  .  
 sorry paul  .  i couldn t help it  .  so why doesn t he give you a hand ? 
 he watch the tob too much  .  now really i don t know  .  but i can t handle this much longer  .  
 well     _comma_     talk to him     _comma_     and let me know what happens     _comma_     ok ? 
you re from new york   _comma_   aren t you ? 
 yes   _comma_   that s right  .  
 what do you suggest i should see in new york ? 
 well   _comma_   how about the museum of modern art ? 
 no   _comma_   i don t like museums  .  they re boring  .  
 why don t you go to see the empire state building ? 
 ah ! that sounds interesting  .  
what s your favorite book ? 
 it s gone with the wind  .  
 why do you like it best ? 
 i enjoy the various characters and the plot  .  
 well  .  i like the thom birds best  .  
 is it very interesting ? 
 sure  .  i like the writer s language   _comma_   too  .  
 if i have a chance   _comma_   i ll enjoy the book  .  
 would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? 
 that s a good idea  .  let s go ! 
john   _comma_   my father isn t there at all  .  are you kidding ? 
 cool     _comma_     fellow     _comma_     what s the date today     _comma_     buddy ? 
 it s  .  oh it s the  st april   _comma_   april fool s day  .  
 you forgot all of about it   _comma_   didn t you ? 
i ’ m pretty sure that jim will turn out to be a good lawyer  .  
 how can you be so sure ? 
 he knows a lot about law and he ’ s eloquent   _comma_   too  .  
could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from dr  .  miller ? 
 yes  .  are you going to be taking a class from him ? 
 yes   _comma_   but i have never taken his class before  .  
 he is very interesting and challenging  .  is that what you are looking for ? 
 yes   _comma_   that s what i need  .  
 he is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade  .  are you willing to study hard ? 
 yes   _comma_   i guess so  .  
 what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher  .  do you enjoy that in a teacher ? 
 yes   _comma_   i had a teacher like that before  .  
 did you know that he has    years teaching experience ? 
 no    _comma_    i didn t    _comma_    but that could be a good thing  .  
 well   _comma_   take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you  .  good luck ! 
honey   _comma_   what s wrong with you ? 
 i m not feeling well  .  i m very nervous  .  
 take it easy  .  we are going to have our own baby  .  you should be happy  .  
 yeah   _comma_   i know  .  
 the doctors and the nurses will help you  .  and i will be waiting for you right here   _comma_   praying for you and our baby  .  
 thank you   _comma_   dear  .  i feel better now  .  
the weather is terrible  .  
 yeah  .  it s been raining a lot these days  .  
 i have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain  .  
 have you heard when it s supposed to get better ? 
 i saw the weather report   _comma_   and it s going to rain for the next eight days  .  
 that sucks so much  .  what are we going to do ? 
 i m getting pretty bored  .  we should do something despite the rain  .  
 i m with you  .  what do you have in mind ? 
 i haven t been to the mall in a long time  .  let s go there  .  
 that sounds good  .  they have a movie theatre there    _comma_    so if we get bored    _comma_    we can watch a movie  .  
 great  .  i ll stop by your place now  .  
 ok  .  don t forget to bring your umbrella  .  the rain can start up again anytime  .  
come in    _comma_    come in    _comma_    what can i do for you ? 
 professor donald   _comma_   are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? 
 yes   _comma_   i am applying on it  .  
 i wonder if i could enroll in it  .  i know it is a graduate course and i   m a junior   _comma_   but  .  
 aren t you a bit young ? i have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up  .  
 i know   _comma_   but geology of the american west is my major interest and i have done a large reading in the field  .  
 well    _comma_    if you think you are ready    _comma_    i ll let you enroll  .  
 oh    _comma_    thanks    _comma_    professor donald  .  this is really very nice of you  .  
 .  so       _comma_       i said       _comma_       let ’ s take a break . and since that night       _comma_       i ’ ve been waiting for him to call       _comma_       but i still haven ’ t heard from him  .  you don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else       _comma_       do you ? 
 come on   _comma_   don ’ t be so dramatic ! i ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine  .  
 you think so ? oh   _comma_   no ! how can he do this to me ? i ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! why else wouldn ’ t he call ? 
 but   _comma_   you two are on a break  .  theoretically he can do whatever he likes  .  
 he ’ s the love of my life ! i ’ ve really messed this up  .  
 come on   _comma_   hon  .  pull yourself together  .  it ’ s going to be alright  .  
 but i  .  i still love him ! and it ’ s all my fault ! i can ’ t believe how immature and selfish i was being  .  i mean    _comma_    he is a firefighter    _comma_    it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner  .  i ’ ve totally messed this up ! 
 you know what    _comma_    veronica    _comma_    i think you should make the first step  .  i ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you  .  
 no   _comma_   this is not gonna happen ! i  .  i ’ ve ruined everything  .  
 do you hear something ? 
what s wrong   _comma_   jerry ? you look so upset  .  
 to be honest   _comma_   i was just dumped  .  
 oh   _comma_   i m sorry to hear that  .  you can go on a holiday to cheer you up  .  
 no   _comma_   thanks  .  i m not in the mood for traveling  .  
 come on  .  a trip will do you good  .  are you doing anything this weekend ? 
 i was planning on doing a lot of wallowing  .  
 well   _comma_   my friends and i are planning on going to shangri la on saturday  .  do you want to come with us ? 
 where is that ? 
 not very far from here  .  we ll fly  .  it s about one and a half hours  .  
 what s there to see ? 
 there is a large canyon    _comma_    vast grasslands    _comma_    ancient forests and mountain lakes  .  
 oh   _comma_   sounds nice  .  
 yes   _comma_   the scenery there is breathtaking  .  i have some pictures at home  .  you can come over and take a look if you like  .  
 ok  .  then i can make up my mind  .  
did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ? 
 yes   _comma_   just once  .  
 what was the reason ? 
 i once played truant when i was in college because i intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster hit areas in sichuan  .  
do you want to hang out tomorrow ? 
 oh   _comma_   i can t  .  i have a date ! 
 really ? wow with who ? 
 this girl i ve been chatting with for the past couple of months  .  she s really cool and she s driving over here this weekend  .  
 wait a minute   _comma_   you mean you met her online ? 
 yeah ! i signed up for a website called match   .  com and it is great ! you fill in all your details and preferences   _comma_   like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets  .  then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat  .  
 that is kind of weird ! what if she is a psycho or something like that ? 
 it s the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! i am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! i think this is a really cool alternative   _comma_   especially if you are a bit shy  .  
 i guess it does seem logical  .  i ll have to check it out ! 
well   _comma_   i m afraid i must be going now  .  i have no idea it was so late  .  
 stay for dinner with us  .  
 i m afraid i can t  .  i have a dinner party at seven tonight  .  you see   _comma_   i am going to england the day after tomorrow  .  
 well   _comma_   i won t keep you then  .  it was very nice of you to come to see me  .  
 it has been a pleasure  .  goodbye  .  
 goodbye  .  thank you again for coming  .  
honey   _comma_   do you have a second ? 
 sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what ’ s on your mind ? 
 we need to talk  .  
 okay  .  
 i ’ ve been thinking    _comma_    and well    _comma_    i think we need to start seeing other people  .  
 what ? why ? i mean      _comma_      we ’ ve had our ups and downs      _comma_      and we have the occasional disagreement      _comma_      but we ’ re happy together      _comma_      aren ’ t we ? 
 that ’ s just it      _comma_      i ’ m not happy anymore      _comma_      tim  .  it ’ s not you      _comma_      it ’ s me  .  i know that i can be hard to deal with      _comma_      and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for ! 
 so   _comma_   what are you saying ? you ’ re breaking up with me because i ’ m perfect ? 
 tim      _comma_      you are too good for me  .  you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy  .  oh      _comma_      i could say that i ’ ll be all you need      _comma_      but that would be a lie  .  i know i ’ d only hurt you      _comma_      i know i ’ d only make you cry  .  
 baby     _comma_     come on  .  don ’ t do this to me ! whatever it is     _comma_     we can work it out  .  just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this     _comma_     but we gotta stick together ! don ’ t leave me  .  
 i can ’ t    _comma_    tim  .  i hope someday you can find some way to understand i ’ m only doing this for you  .  i don ’ t really wanna go but    _comma_    deep in my heart i know this is the kindest thing to do  .  
 laura  .  
 here are your keys  .  i ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week  .  i ’ m sorry    _comma_    tim  .  i wish you all the best    _comma_    and i hope that one day we can meet again  .  i ’ ll always love you  .  goodbye  .  
oh   _comma_   my god  .  i can t take it any more  .  
 what s wrong   _comma_   honey ? take it easy  .  
 i am tired of doing that boring work  .  i just repeat doing counting everyday  .  it s so terrible  .  
 me too  .  but i think we can do something else for a change  .  
 you know i work with my professional knowledge not passion  .  sometimes i don t know what the meaning of working is ? 
 but you did a good job  .  you always perform the best in our company  .  
 yes   _comma_   that s in the past  .  maybe i need to go to my psychologist for help  .  
 perhaps you ve just tired and you need a vacation  .  
 i was full of ambitions before  .  but now i have no aim for my career  .  
 maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting  .  
 that sounds interesting  .  but i don t know how to do that  .  
 how about a training course ? 
 a training course ? that must be costly  .  
 but it s worth it  .  maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future  .  
 ok   _comma_   let s have a try  .  
 ok  .  
have you seen the new james bond movie ? 
 oh   _comma_   yes  .  you ? 
 yes  .  what did you think of it ? 
 i thought it was better than the others i really liked it  .  what did you think of it ? 
 yes     _comma_     i liked it     _comma_     too  .  it was exciting     _comma_     but not over the top  .  do you know what i mean ? 
 mmm  .  that s what i thought too  .  i really liked the car chase   _comma_   and the opening credit sequence was very exciting  .  and i always enjoy watching pierce brosnan  .  
 oh   _comma_   yes  .  he s brilliant  .  did you like the title song ? 
 not as much as last time   _comma_   actually  .  what s the name of the american actor who was in the supporting role ? 
 hum    _comma_    edward norton    _comma_    or something like that  .  did you like him ? 
 yes  .  he was excellent  .  they worked well together   _comma_   don t you think ? 
 i don t know  .  i think the woman was better  .  she provided a good love interest  .  lucky james bond ! 
 yes ! 
my friend jean is very beautiful  .  
 what s her figure ? 
 perfect   _comma_   and i like her charming eyes too  .  
 what s the color of her eyes ? 
 dark blue  .  
where are you going ? 
 i m going to buy a cd  .  
 why not listen to music online ? 
 then i will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line   _comma_   isn t it ? 
 you can audition music on line    _comma_    and you can audition it off line after downloading it    _comma_    so you needn t pay for it  .  
 i have downloaded one   _comma_   but it still can t be listened  .  
 in order to listen to music   _comma_   you must have the necessary software  .  
 can you recommend some to me ? 
 certainly  .  realplayer is a good  .  
 can i download it ? 
 yes   _comma_   but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it  .  
 i ll try it tonight  .  
what were you and richard talking about earlier ? it looked intense  .  
 yeah   _comma_   richard said something to me that i didn t appreciate  .  
 oh   _comma_   no  .  i know how insensitive he can be  .  what has he done now ? 
 he asked me how long it took me to learn english  .  
 but   _comma_   you were born and raised in california ! 
 yeah    _comma_    but i get that sometimes  .  it doesn t matter how many generations my family has lived in the u  .  s  .     _comma_    we ll always be foreigners in their eyes  .  
 what a racist ! how can you stand working with the guy ? 
 you know    _comma_    richard isn t such a bad guy  .  he made the comment out of ignorance    _comma_    not malice  .  
 so   _comma_   what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn english ? 
 i told him    years  .  and    _comma_    he knows i m    years old since i just celebrated my birthday last week  .  he was puzzled for a minute    _comma_    and then he got it  .  
 are you sure he really got the message ? 
 yeah   _comma_   i m pretty sure since i then asked him how long it took him to learn english  .  
 that s hilarious ! what did he say ? 
 he said     _comma_          years     _comma_       and we both laughed about it  .  he apologized and now     _comma_     it s all good  .

 ok     _comma_     well     _comma_     my friends and i are planning on going to the beach on sunday  .  we tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere     _comma_     so you could still sleep in  .  do you want to come with us ? 
 that d be fantastic ! which beach are you going to ? 
 it s a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city  .  
 what should i bring with me ? 
 we ve got plenty of inflatables    _comma_    but if you want to sit on a chair    _comma_    you ll have to bring your own sunlounger  .  
 i can just use my beach towel  .  i love lazing around in the sun  .  
 do you like surfing ? 
 i ve actually never tired  .  do you have a surfboard ? 
 we ve got a few  .  i can teach you how to surf on sunday  .  it ll be fun ! 
 i can t wait ! it sounds like we re going to have a great time  .  how much money should i bring ? 
 you ll just need roughly      for food and gas money  .  my friend is driving   _comma_   so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money  .  
 ok   _comma_   where and when should i meet you ? 
 we ll pick you up at your place at noon  .  be there or be square ! 
i m not really accustomed to the style of the new boss  .  
 it ll take us all some time to get used to the change  .  
i give up ! i simply can t learn french ! 
 why do you say that ? i think you re making a lot of progress  .  
 no   _comma_   i m not  .  i try and try and i still can t speak it very well  .  
 learning any language takes a lot of effort . but don t give up  .  why don t we practise those dialogues together ? 
 good idea  .  that might help  .  
he said i have a big nose  .  i wonder what that means  .  
 you are interested in other people ’ s business   _comma_   aren ’ t you ? 
 does he mean i am inquisitive or i ’ m noisy ? 
 yes  .  
excuse me   _comma_   i d like to ask you a few questions about the city  .  
 ok   _comma_   please  .  
 my wife wants to take the children to go shopping   _comma_   where is the best place to go ? 
 i would recommend the mall    _comma_    it s about    minutes    _comma_    drive to the south in a taxi  .  it has a wide range of shops and restaurants  .  
 thank you  .  also   _comma_   we d like to do some sightseeing while we re in town  .  can you recommend some local attractions ? 
 how old are your children ? 
 i have a      year old boy and a     year old girl  .  
 i would recommend a day at the zoo  .  it s fun for all the family  .  there is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip  .  
 it sounds marvelous  .  thank you for your help  .  
boy    _comma_    it looks like everyone in your family is here    _comma_    from young to old  .  
 easter s a good day for reunions  .  the family goes to church together  .  
 and after church they come here for lunch ? 
 yup   _comma_   a big potluck buffet  .  and then notice there are no children around ? 
 yeah   _comma_   what s up with that ? 
 the kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these  .  hide away   _comma_   yi jun !

 no    _comma_    no    _comma_    no  .  i m not interested in literature  .  
 ok   _comma_   do you know the title of the book ? 
 oh   _comma_   sorry  .  i m always absent minded  .  i remember that i ve put a note in my pocket  .

 oh    _comma_    such bad luck    _comma_    sir  .  can you please name the category of the book ? 
 let me see  .  it s not fiction  .  it s biography  .  
 ok    _comma_    i ll search it for you  .  a moment    _comma_    please  .  
 thanks  .  
how do you decide what grade we get ? 
 i look at many things     _comma_     attendance     _comma_     quizzes     _comma_     and tests  .  
 what is the most important factor ? 
 obviously i look for improvement as we go along   _comma_   but i would like you to do your best from the beginning  .  
 how can we keep track of our grades ? 
 the final and midterm are    percent of your grade ; homework    _comma_    attendance    _comma_    and quizzes total    percent  .  
 what if we can t get to school ? 
 you can only miss one class without penalty  .  
 if we have a major problem   _comma_   will you let us know ? 
 i will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem  .  
we re thinking about going to america  .  
 have you thought about the cost ? 
 there is that  .  
 i believe it ll be very expensive  .  
may i help you with something ? 
 i would like to return some books  .  
 i ’ ll take them  .  
 here you go  .  
 these books were due two weeks ago  .  
 yeah  .  i totally forgot they were due  .  
 you will need to pay late fees on these books  .  
 how much are the late fees ? 
 the fee is    cents every day  .  
 i have to pay    cents a day ? 
 and that ’ s for each book that is late  .  
 that shouldn ’ t be a problem  .  
this is such a beautiful day ! great for sailing ! 
 it sure is ! the water looks so nice ! anchor the boat for a little while  .  i ’ m going to take a dip  .  
 why are you doggy paddling ? i taught you how to swim ! do your breast stroke ! 
 i get too tired ! i ’ ll just backstroke   _comma_   it ’ s easier ! 
 try kicking your legs more  .  that ’ s good  .  don ’ t go out too far ! 
 it ’ s fine  .  jump in ! 
 kathy ! get back here ! i see a shark ! 
 ahahah ! ! ! help me ! help ! bring the boat closer ! the shark is coming straight towards me ! 
 it ’ s right under you ! kathy ! ! ! 
what was your wedding ceremony like   _comma_   abigail ? 
 my husband and i got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses  .  but then we had three parties to celebrate  .  
 three parties ? that s quite a lot  .  that must have been expensive ! 
 well     _comma_     since my husband and i are from two different countries     _comma_     and we live in a third country     _comma_     we decided to have one in each country  .  it wasn t actually that expensive  .  
 were your parents upset that they weren t there to see you get married ? 
 i would have liked them to be there     _comma_     but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us     _comma_     and we couldn t afford to fly out to see them     _comma_     so they understood  .  
 did your husband s family get to meet your family ? 
 my husband s parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown    _comma_    so that was great  .  some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions    _comma_    but we agreed t 
 that makes sense  .  did you go on a honeymoon ? 
 we waited until our one year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to africa  .  
 you really didn t have a very traditional wedding   _comma_   did you ? 
 not at all    _comma_    but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either    _comma_    so it suited us perfectly ! 
oh     _comma_     hi     _comma_     jessica     _comma_     are you going to see this movie too ?

 yeah   _comma_   a number of times  .  
 what s he trying to pull anyway  .  
 i don t know  .  but this is definitely the last straw  .  
 maybe you should start seeing someone else  .  
 you said it  .  ok    _comma_    let s go in    _comma_    sandy  .

 i ’ m sorry       _comma_       sir       _comma_       we cannot grant you a b  visa at this time       _comma_       instead       _comma_       you are granted a resident visa ! congratulations       _comma_       you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! you win ! congratulations ! 
good afternoon   _comma_   madam  .  how can i help you ?

 so what do you provide ? 
 first of all   _comma_   we ll design a custom made work out plan according to your habits  .  
 how can you get that done ? 
 well   _comma_   we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified  .  and he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work out plan for your needs  .  
 what else ? 
 since everyone is different   _comma_   your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal  .  
 sounds pretty good  .  what about the charge ? 
 that depends  .  we offer membership for one month   _comma_   half a year and one year  .  
 maybe one month  .  just have a try first  .  not too tough at the beginning  .  
 wise decision  .  you ll find it s totally worth it  .  
do you watch a lot of tv ? 
 not really  .  i could take it or leave it  .  
 not me  .  i have to have my tv and watch whatever comes on  .  
 how can you do that ? 
hi  .  what s your name ? 
 my name is jung min  .  what s your name ? 
 my name is jessica  .  it s nice to meet you  .  
 yes  .  it s nice to meet you too  .  are you a new student too ? 
 no  .  i m a sophomore  .  i take it you are a new student ? 
 yeah  .  it s pretty exciting to be here  .  
 have fun while it lasts  .  the excitement wears off real quick  .  especially after you see how much homework you get  .  where are you from ? 
 i m from korea  .  my parents wanted me to go to an american university   _comma_   so i came here  .  
 i have never been to korea  .  i ve been to japan before   _comma_   but never korea  .  
 why were you in japan ? 
 my father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country  .  he s so into learning about different cultures  .  
 that s pretty cool  .  
 i thought it would have been more fun if i went without my parents  .  
 well    _comma_    if you ever want to visit korea    _comma_    i would be happy to show you around  .  
 thanks for the offer  .  i ll keep that in mind  .  oh   _comma_   the professor is coming  .  we ll talk more after class  .  
 ok  .  
guess who i saw just now ? 
 who ? 
 john smith   _comma_   the escaped criminal  .  
 that bad egg   _comma_   who took the low road since he was a boy  .  
 i think i must report to the cops  .  
 ok  .  
what do you think of this one ? 
 eh   _comma_   so so  .  
 and this one ? too flashy ? 
 nah   _comma_   not too flashy  .  
 hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn ’ t it hideous ? 
 i guess  .  
 are you even listening ? i ’ m trying to have a conversation with you  .  
 and i ’ m trying to watch the game   _comma_   but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! 
 well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon ! 
 well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it ’ s the third quarter and you ’ ve been blabbering on since the first ! 
 oh    _comma_    your precious game  .  you watch the same game every year    _comma_    and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! 
 oh no you didn ’ t  .  you didn ’ t just insult the sals bury seals   _comma_   did you ? why don ’ t you just  .  just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? 
 i might just ! enjoy your stupid game ! 
hello  .  nice to see you again  .  i heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery  .  i hope everything ’ s ok  .  
 yes    _comma_    fine  .  i had something wrong with my stomach  .  i won ’ t go into detail    _comma_    but it wasn ’ t serious  .  
 i really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital  .  
 i think most people are a little nervous about it  .  i was really very    _comma_    very nervous just before i had the operation    _comma_    but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing i remember was waking up after the operation  .  
 it must have really hurt afterwards  .  
 well    _comma_    the nurse game me plenty of painkillers    _comma_    but it did feel uncomfortable  .  i wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for    hours  .  that was the worse thing  .  
 i bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital  .  
 i certainly was ! however    _comma_    the doctor gave me a list of food i couldn ’ t eat for another    hours    _comma_    and steak was on the list ! 
 is there any pain now ? 
 no   _comma_   not at all  .  i stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days  .  
 did they take good care of you in the hospital ? 
 oh     _comma_     yes  .  the nurse were very kind     _comma_     though they were strict about what i could drink  .  in the end     _comma_     i just drank water and nothing else  .  everyone was very professional and i actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay  .  
how was the party ? 
 i had a fantastic time  .  
hi    _comma_    monica    _comma_    how is everything going ? 
 everything goes well   _comma_   but i am thinking about quitting my current job  .  
 why ? you ’ re not satisfied anymore ? 
 i just sense  .  but i cannot grow anymore  .  my boss is not really supporting me  .  i am interested in some positions in other jv companies   _comma_   but i need to do some more in depth research before i send my application letters out  .  
 that is important  .  doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application  .  
 certainly   _comma_   it is very nice talking with you  .  but i really have to go now  .  catch you later  .  
 ok   _comma_   good luck to you  .  
henry married rose only after her father s money   _comma_   didn t he ?

 but he seems to be very happy with rose  .  
 he is more nice than wise  .

 yes   _comma_   it is annoying  .  
hi   _comma_   mr  .  smith  .  what s new ?

 ok        _comma_        wait a minute  .  let s see  .  i m a taurus        _comma_        and it says        _comma_        mars is in the third house        _comma_        and is soon to eclipse venus  .  i don t know what that means        _comma_        but then it says        _comma_        your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking  .  remember to be positive  .  sounds good to me  .  
 what about gemini ? what s the prediction ? 
 since mercury has crossed paths with jupiter    _comma_    your fortunes are falling  .  bad luck will follow you today    _comma_    and you will lose that which you value  .  be careful  .  
 that sounds bad ! i m really worried   _comma_   what should i do ? maybe i should go home and stay in the rest of the day  .  
 but we have a date tonight ! you can t stay at home because of a stupid horoscope  .  
lily   _comma_   can you take part in our picnic this weekend ? 
 that sounds great  .  where are you going ? 
 i think we can go to the river   _comma_   go around and have supper  .  
 what should i bring ? 
 nothing  .  just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking  .  we ll bring everything  .  
what do you think of doctor thomson ? 
 i feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter s disease  .  
 how can you be so sure ? 
 i can tell form the way he spoke to us  .  
 never believe his words  .  
should we ask jason to play ? he s always watching movies on hbo  .  
 i guess we should invite him  .  i just hope he doesn t start talking about sylvester stallone and arnold schwarzenegger again  .  
 oh     _comma_     come on ! the game is better with three people  .  anyway     _comma_     if we don t ask him to play     _comma_     he ll be mad  .  
 yeah   _comma_   you re right  .  we ll never hear the end of it  .  
what do you think about violence in movies ? 
 personally   _comma_   i m not for it  .  i feel it s bad for kids to watch  .  
 but kids like watching things like that  .  it s just for fun   _comma_   would t you say ? 
 if you ask me   _comma_   i have to disagree  .  something shouldn t be watched for fun  .  
are you free tomorrow night ? 
 yes   _comma_   i am  .  
 shall we have dinner together ? 
 do you have a special restaurant in mind ? 
 yes   _comma_   i do  .  i know a place that has excellent food  .

if only our company prescribe flex time  .  
 the board has been considering introducing flex time  .  
 good news  .  ah   _comma_   what if be even better if alternative work place is provided  .  
 then our entire job could be done by telecommuting  .  
brian   _comma_   do you know how to speak english ? 
 yes  .

 have you ever been to las vegas ? 
 yes  .  i went there once on a business trip  .  
how are the children doing at sport ? 
 i ’ m very pleased with their performances  .  timmy can cover the     meters in    seconds  .  that ’ s very fast for a kid his age  .  
 he ’ s not very good at the long jump though   _comma_   is he ? 
 he ’ s not bad  .  he can jump a distance of over four meters  .  i think he just prefers running to jumping  .  jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump  .  he can jump over two meters  .  again   _comma_   that ’ s fine for someone his age  .  
 two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at long distance running ? 
 the longest race we run is the      meters  .  a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes  .  
 how are they at swimming ? 
 they ’ re ok  .  i ask them to swim     meters each day  .  that ’ s    lengths of the swimming pool  .  they ’ re not very fast   _comma_   but that ’ s ok  .  i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape  .  
 kate is very good at diving from a height of    meters  .  
 i ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! 
 i think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet  .  she started diving from a lower height   _comma_   but she soon wanted to go higher  .  
 it seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster   _comma_   higher and further  .  
hi    _comma_    mary  .  i haven t seen you in ages ! i heard that you and daniel are getting married on august  th    _comma_    the opening day of the      olympic games  .  is it true ? 
 yes    _comma_    it is  .  we ve been dating for over   years  .  we have decided to get married on a special day and we think august  th    _comma_         is a red letter day  .  
 good for you ! it sounds like you ve done a lot of planning in a very short time  .  
 yes        _comma_        there is a lot of to be taken care of   wedding photos        _comma_        wedding dress        _comma_        catering        _comma_        transport        _comma_        hotel        _comma_        etc  .  
 is everything ready now ? 
 almost  .  the only thing that isn t ready is the hotel  .  as a lot of people have chosen that day to get married   _comma_   it is hard to find a hotel that isn t too expensive  .  
 have you tried the peninsula palace beijing ? my wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job  .  
 yes    _comma_    we called    _comma_    but it is booked up  .  the only choice is the regent beijing but we haven t made up our minds yet  .  
 it s an excellent hotel  .  a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect   _comma_   though very expensive  .  
 that s why we want to have a look at other hotels  .  we don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception  .  
 i guess you re right  .  i can help you ask other hotels  .  i am sure there are probably some available  .  
 thank you  .  
 my pleasure  .  
why didn t you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
 sorry   _comma_   i thought you knew  .  
 but you should have told me you were in love with her  .  
 didn t i ? 
 you know you didn t  .  
 well   _comma_   i m telling you now  .  
 yes   _comma_   but you might have told me before  .  
 i didn t think you d be interested  .  
 you can t be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
 sorry   _comma_   i didn t think it mattered  .  
 oh   _comma_   you men ! you re all the same  .  
professor   _comma_   i ve handed in my paper  .  did you read it ? 
 yes  .  you ve done a good job  .  but there s one thing  .  you should narrow down your topic  .  
 what about water pollution instead of pollution ? 
how ’ s it going ? 
 i ’ m fine  .  thank you  .  
 do you need anything ? 
 i need you to help me  .  
 what can i do for you ? 
 i am looking for an article in a newspaper  .

 i didn ’ t even bother to think of that  .  
 i ’ ll show you where to find your article  .  
 i get lost in this library  .  
 it ’ s right this way  .  
 thanks a lot for your help  .  
how about eating out for a drink with me tonight  .

 no problem  .  let s say  :   p  .  m  .  at the royal restaurant   _comma_   ok ? 
 all right  .  see you tomorrow night  .  
hi   _comma_   helen ! how is it going ? 
 i m very busy these days  .  it seems i can never finish my work  .  
 well   _comma_   take it easy ! don t let it get on top of you  .  
 i ll try  .  i m under a lot of pressure right now  .  
 why don t you take a few days off ? 
 i can t  .  i am really behind of my work  .  
can you speak japanese ? 
 yes    _comma_    i can    _comma_    but not very well  .  
 where did you learn it ? 
 at school  .  and i m still learning it now  .  
 how long have you been learning it ? 
 about three years  .  
 can you speak any other languages ? 
 i m afraid not  .  
good afternoon   _comma_   johnson  .  
 good afternoon   _comma_   mary  .  how s business ? 
 not bad   _comma_   thanks  .  
i m too tired now  .  i ve already worked for    hours overtime ! 
 god ! don t you think they should get you an assistant ? 
 yes     _comma_     they were supposed to     _comma_     but so far nobody s turned up     _comma_     and i have to do the work alone  .  this is the first break i ve had all day  .  
 they re really running you into the ground  .  why don t you ask for some time off ? you could take a long weekend and have a good rest  .  
 i m afraid i can t before i finish this project  .  
 you d better pay more attention to your health  .  
 i will   _comma_   thanks for your concern  .  
 you re welcome  .  
it is too bad today  .  
 what happened ? 
 my som was lost  .  i told him to stand rooted to the spot when i went shopping   _comma_   but he ignored it  .  
 how did you find him at last ? 
 it was the police wo helped me to do that  .  
 it must have taught you a lesson this time  .  
i want to give our kitchen the works  .  
 why ? i think it ’ s convenient and good  .  
 no  .  the decoration has been out of date  .  my friends have a whole kitchen now  .  it ’ s modern  .  
 why should we run after the fashion ? 
 i am not running after the fashion  .  i just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen  .  
rock music really leaves me cold  .  what about you ? 
 i m crazy about it . it makes me very excited  .  
 then tell me what s good about it  .  
 it can t be expressed by words  .  
what s wrong with debbie today ? she seems upset about something  .  
 i have no idea  .  maybe she had a fight with her husband  .  
look    _comma_    here is a very special business card from an illustrator  .  every time i go through my book of business cards    _comma_    i will notice it  .  it is an eye catching one  .  
 wow   _comma_   fantastic  .  i like the font and color for his name  .  it is creative yet personal  .  
 yes   _comma_   it is a bold design  .  people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card  .  it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations  .  
 i agree  .  business cards are great tools for promoting personal business  .  it won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card    _comma_    but it can make a big difference among the crowd  .  and you ’ ll always notice it from your collection  .  for they have outspoken colors    _comma_    own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card  .  i wish to have one like this  .  but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow  .  
morning   _comma_   peter  .  nice suit ! a new one ? 
 oh    _comma_    yes  .  my wife bought it for me yesterday  .  hmm    _comma_    you look nice in that yellow dress  .  yellow suits you really well  .  
 maybe  .  several people have suggested that i get more yellow clothes  .  they say the color suits me because i have a fair complexion  .  
 that s right  .  you know       _comma_       pink       _comma_       green and black could also be good for you  .  actually       _comma_       i think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion  .  it s just that different colors can give people different impressions  .  for example       _comma_       black could make you look mature       _comma_       while pink could make you look young and energetic  .  
 thank you for your compliments  .  it sounds like you re a clothing expert  .  
 well    _comma_    compared with my wife    _comma_    i m just a beginner  .  
did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? 
 what ? why do we have to do that ? 
 well     _comma_     at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon  .  this is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth  .  in any case     _comma_     to take better advantage of the daylight available     _comma_     we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour  .  
 i see  .  that ’ s convenient ! i never understood things like this   _comma_   such as gmt  .  i never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! 
 that just stands for greenwich mean time  .  here in california      _comma_      we are in pacific standard time      _comma_      that is eight time zones west of greenwich  .  remember when we were in beijing ? well      _comma_      then we were in china standard time      _comma_      and that ’ s eight time zones east of greenwich ! 
 that ’ s why it was so weird traveling from beijing to la ! because of the huge time difference    _comma_    even though we left beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours    _comma_    we still arrived in la the same day at noon ! it ’ s like we went back in time ! 
i would like to watch the oscars on tv tonight  .  how about you ? 
 yes   _comma_   i ‘ d love to  .  it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good  .  
 i like watching it for the fashion  .  i like to see what the ladies are wearing  .  of course   _comma_   the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo  .  
 sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours  .  which films do you think will win awards this year ? 
 i ‘ m really not sure  .  usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony   _comma_   but this year there are several contenders  .  
 you ’ re right  .  this year should be much more exciting than usual  .  what ’ s you favourite award category ? 
 you might think this strange   _comma_   but i like the category for best foreign language film  .  
 it ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood  .  i like the best actor and actress  .  
how many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? 
 we have two cleaning ladies  .  but both of them have received little education  .  
 most cleaning ladies are illiterate  .  but some of them do a very nice job  .  
 but i actually dislike another lady  .  she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own  .  but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us  .  she would tell you what to do and where to put things  .  
how do you celebrate national day in your country ? 
 there are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building  .  
 what kinds of parades are there ? 
 the parades are usually military ones   _comma_   but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs  .  what do you do on national day in your country ? 
 we don ’ t have a national day  .  
 really ? that ’ s unusual  .  
 i guess it is  .  most countries have on   _comma_   but we don ’ t  .  
 actually     _comma_     even though we have parades     _comma_     most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping  .  in the evening     _comma_     many people watch special tv shows which celebrate national day  .  
hi melissa   _comma_   are you going home this weekend ? 
 no   _comma_   not this weekend  .  i have too much work to do  .  
 where do your parents live ? 
 my father lives in washington dc  .  
 how about your mother ? 
 my mother died two years ago  .  
 oh   _comma_   i am sorry to hear that  .  is your father still working ? 
 no   _comma_   he s retired  .

 yes   _comma_   i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston  .  
 do you see them a lot ? 
 not as much as i d like to  .  usually just on holidays like thanksgiving and christmas  .  
hey   _comma_   how was the show ? 
 not great  .  it s a kind of boring  .  
 really ? i heard it was supposed to be great  .  
 yes   _comma_   me too  .  but i m disappointed  .  
what happened   _comma_   john ? 
 nothing  .  
 why do you look unhappy ? 
 i ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off  .  
 oh   _comma_   cheer up  .  he ’ ll understand you  .  
 i hope so  .  
you know that ? joan has got the scholarship  .  
 really ? 
 but i think henry is a backroom boy . he always helps her with her study  .  
 you re right  .  
hi    _comma_    tina    _comma_    i ’ ve got good news  .  i have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with abc company  .  they informed me to go to the final round next monday  .  it looks very promising  .  
 that is awesome  .  congratulation ! i know you can make it  .  
 thanks  .  let ’ s go for a celebration this evening  .  are you free ? 
 yes  .  wait for me at the cafe down my office building  .  see  pm   _comma_   ok ? 
 no problem  .  see you ! 
 see you ! 
do you like ethnic food ? 
 i do ! my favorites are mexican    _comma_    thai    _comma_    and indian  .  
 really ? have you ever tried moroccan ? 
 i can t say that i have  .  what are the basic ingredients ? 
 i don t know  .  a friend of mine said i should try it  .  
 do you know where a moroccan restaurant is ? 
 as a matter of fact   _comma_   he gave me this address  .  
 let s go there for lunch ! i m up for an adventure ! 
nicole   _comma_   your fettucini is very  .  unique  .  
 but not as good as your mother s   _comma_   right ? 
 actually   _comma_   it s better  .  
 what ? are you kidding ? 
 no  .  it was the only dish she wasn t good at  .  so we could use you as the new head chef  .  
 oh   _comma_   uncle giovanni  .  that s wonderful ! thank you ! thank you ! 
 ok   _comma_   ok  .  get back to work  .  there s someone waiting for you in the kitchen  .  
how many people are there in your family ? 
 five . my father     _comma_     mother     _comma_     brother     _comma_     sister in law and me  .  
 is your brother older or younger than you ? 
 he is five years older than me   _comma_   he got married last sunday . my brother and my sister in law are the same age  .  
hello   _comma_   tom  .  where are you heading for ? 
 i am going to a movie theater  .  you know there is a new action film produced by hollywood  .  a thriller   _comma_   really  .  
 another terror film ? there is too much terror and violence in the films  .  do you like seeing such a picture ? 
 i don t really like seeing bloody frames   _comma_   but i appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects  .  
did you go to the concert last weekend ? 
 no   _comma_   i didn t  .  and you ? was it good ? 
 yes  .  i did  .  i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer   _comma_   a violinist and a pianist  .  
 how much was the ticket ? 
 i only paid two dollars for mine  .  
mary and tom are breaking up  .  
 it s unbelievable ! they are only married for one month  .  then who is at fault ? 
 mary said she couldn t put up with tom   _comma_   for he fell in love with another woman  .  
 do you think they ll become reconciled ? 
 no   _comma_   i don t think so  .  she said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage  .  
 what a shame ! their marriage is really a mistake  .  
have you ever been invited to a chinese feast ? 
 sure  .  beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality  .  
 as far as you could see   _comma_   is dining at a chinese table a distinct experience ? to what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? 
 to begin with   _comma_   i have to use chopsticks  .  
 but you look quite proficient in using them now  .  
 certainly  .  after all    _comma_    i ve been here for two years  .  it s not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to chinese dinner utensils  .  though    _comma_    i do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a ch 
 yes    _comma_    table etiquette  .  there are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told  .  some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to westerners    _comma_    while they are the norm i 
 anything strang about that ? 
 maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate  .  they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices  .  it s very inauspicious   _comma_   and might enrage all present  .  
 oh   _comma_   sorry ! there s a long story even with a mere pair of sticks  .  
it really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens  .  i even want to wring his neck  .  
 don t be so angry  .  it s passed anyway  .  
 i can t forget it  .  
 you d better cool yourself down first  .  
let s program your courses  .  since you have had english literature    _comma_    you should take american literature and american prose and fiction . you transcript indicate that your english background is strong    _comma_    so i don t think you have any problem with it  .  
 how many credits for each course ? 
 three   _comma_   you also should take two three credit course in education department  .  
 thank you    _comma_    sir    _comma_    i m sure i will  .  
i hate to go outside  .  
 me too  .  
 why do you hate to go outside ? 
 i meet too many jerks  .  
 i agree  .  
 this city is full of jerks  .  
 rude people are everywhere  .  
 but what can you do ? 
 you can yell at them  .  
 and they will yell back at you  .  
 yelling doesn t do any good  .  
 no  .  the best thing to do is just stay home  .  
i had to announce his innocence in court today   _comma_   but it left a nasty taste in my mouth  .  
 you mean you suspect him  .  
 i ’ m not sure  .  i ’ ll try to prove my feeling  .  
 i hope i can do something for you  .  
actually i have a passion for chinese literature  .  
 you do ? 
 yeah   _comma_   those classics from the great writers  .  
 but i find japanese ones better  .  
jack wonders whether linda likes him or not  .  
 why doesn t he ask her ? 
 he is too scared to ask her  .  
 he s a chicken guy  .  
good morning  .  
 good morning  .  
 what does the paper say ? 
 nothing much — the same old stuff  .  a lot of bad news as usual  .  
 well   _comma_   what ’ s the weather report ? 
 sunny and mild today   _comma_   cloudy and rainy tomorrow  .  
 did they find those bank robbers ? 
 not yet  .  they were holding two men in ohio   _comma_   but they let them go  .  they weren ’ t the criminals after all  .  
 what about the sports page ? what were the scores of last night ’ s games ? 
 here ’ s the paper ; you can read them yourself  .  
i would wondering if you like to stay here for a few days  .  
 it really depends on when and how long 
 until next weekend  .  that ’ s ok  .  
they ’ ll do the operation for you this friday  .  
 but saturday is my birthday  .  
 i think it ’ s important to do now  .  we can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital  .  
 but it won ’ t be on my birthday  .  
 but your health is more important  .  believe me ! 
i hate computer games  .  
 why ? they are fine  .  
 because they are too violent  .  some of them are even disgusting  .  
 indeed there are bad games  .  but many of them are good  .  
 if boys grow up with computer games   _comma_   they will surely become bad  .  
 come on  .  things are not so bad  .  boys can learn to use the computer through games  .  
are you free this weekend   _comma_   miss rose ? 
 yes   _comma_   i am  .  what s up ? 
 then would you please go to a dance party with me ? 
 with pleasure  .  i suppose you dance often  .  
 oh    _comma_    no  .  as a matter of fact    _comma_    i haven t danced for a long time  .  
 but i am told that you dance wonderfully well  .  
 thanks for flattering me  .  i think you dance a lot   _comma_   right ? 
 no  .  just occasionally  .  
 what s your favorite dance ? 
 it s hard to say   _comma_   but i do love the foxtrot and waltz  .  
 how about rock n roll ? 
 to tell you the truth   _comma_   i don t like it  .  it s too noisy  .  
 and the tango ? 
 oh    _comma_    it s really beautiful    _comma_    but i just can t do it well  .  
 don t be so modest  .  i m sure you can do it very well  .  then i ll meet you at six  .  is that at all right ? 
 ok  .  
 great ! i m your lucky fellow then  .  
you are an outgoing person   _comma_   quite easy to talk with  .  
 yes   _comma_   my friends like to get along with me well  .  
 do you have many friends ? 
 yes   _comma_   i like to make new friends  .  
 what do you usually do with them ? 
 we like to get together   _comma_   chat and enjoy beautiful music  .  
doris   _comma_   helen mall is having a big sale this weekend  .  do you wanna go ? 
 don t feel like it  .  i m broke  .  
 well    _comma_    we can still do some window shopping    _comma_    can we ? 
 just look around ? nah   _comma_   that ’ s boring  .  
 i ll go by myself then  .  
i feel like going for a drink   _comma_   it s been a long day  .  
 great idea ! peter   _comma_   i could use the drink  .  
 how about the new bar across the road ? 
 sounds good  .  the food there is fantastic too  .  
 i agree   _comma_   i had lunch there last week  .  
 excellent ! that sounds like a plan  .  
hello   _comma_   are you chinese ? 
 no   _comma_   i m korean  .  where are you from ? 
 i m from america  .  are you settling in all right ? 
 i ve already found a flat and it s quite comfortable  .  what about you ? 
 i live in my uncle s house  .  he came here ten years ago  .  
 what do you think of the local accent here ? has it been causing you any problems ? 
 i think it s just a matter of getting used to it  .  
 i can t agree more  .  
why don t you watch where you re going ? 
 me ? you re the one who pulled out in front of me ! 
 there was plenty of room for me to pull out . you didn t have to stay in the lane you were in  .  
 hey    _comma_    listen  .  i had every right to stay in the lane i was in . you were supposed to wait until i passed to pull out . and anyhow    _comma_    you didn t give me any time to change lanes . all of a sudden  bang  there you are right in front of me  .  
 i think my arm is broken  .  
 sorry about your arm   _comma_   but it serves you right  .  you need to learn how to drive  .  you re lucky you didn t get killed  .  and i m lucky to be alive too  .  
 listen   _comma_   let s just wait until the police get here . then we can decide whose fault this accident was  .  
 fine with me  .  i know the laws of the road  .  i m not worried  .  
 i have a cell phone in my car  .  now it s probably on the floor on the passenger side . why don t you get it for me   _comma_   and then i can call the police ? 
 alright  .  
 it doesn t work  .  it looks like it s broken  .  i need to get to a hospital  .  you should drive me there  .  
 oh   _comma_   yeah ? it s better if we make a police report first  .  then you can go to the hospital  .  
 damn it ! i m injured here  .  we could wait all day for the police  .  
 well   _comma_   you ll just have to wait  .  i m not going to move my car until the police arrive  .  i ll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone  .  don t worry  .  you ll get to the hospital in time  .  
 it really hurts  .  
 yes    _comma_    maybe it does . but if you re going to drive like you did just now    _comma_    you will have to get used to a little physical pain  .  you know what i mean ? 
 to hell with you  .  the accident was your fault  .  
 i m afraid it wasn t  .  and when the police get here   _comma_   you will also see that it wasn t  .  but enough of this bickering  .  i m going to go find a phone . don   t move that arm while i m gone  .  alright ? 
 to hell with you  .  
bill   _comma_   do you know if the cafeteria around the corner s open today ? 
 yes  .  they were open this morning when i came to work  .  they must ve finished remodeling  .  why do you want to know ? 
 well    _comma_    i thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today  .  that is    _comma_    if you haven t promised to go with someone else  .  
 that d be wonderful   _comma_   peter  .  but i hope you re in a better mood than you were this morning  .  
 i m sorry i was such a grouch  .  it must ve been the weather  .  when it rains i get depressed  .  
 forget it  .  i ll see you at   :   am  .  
the stepmother was very wicked  .  she couldn t stand a happy smile on the boy s face  .  
 and ? 
 and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy  .  
 poor child ! 
sorry  .  i didn t mean to be late  .  can i come in ? 
 what s your excuse this time ? 
 have i used the one that my sister is sick ? 
 yes   _comma_   twice last week  .  
 are you sure ? i thought i said it was my mother  .  
 i don t think so  .  but it could ve been  .  
 well  .  you can trust me this time  .  my sister is definitely sick  .  i m just coming from the hospital  .  they say she might even die  .  
 i don t buy your story  .  try not to have any more sick relatives this week   _comma_   all right ? 
 i ll do my best  .  
 just try to be a little more punctual in the future  .  
 i m working on it  .  really ! 
hi    _comma_    becky    _comma_    what s up ? 
 not much   _comma_   except that my mother in law is driving me up the wall  .  
 what s the problem ? 
 she loves to nit pick and criticizes everything that i do  .  i can never do anything right when she   s around  .  
 for example ? 
 well     _comma_     last week i invited her over to dinner  .  my husband and i had no problem with the food     _comma_     but if you listened to her     _comma_     then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables  .  there s just nothing can please her  .  
 no   _comma_   i can t see that happening  .  i know you re a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen  .  
 it s not just that  .  she also criticizes how we raise the kids  .  
 my mother in law used to do the same thing to us  .  if it wasn t disciplining them enough     _comma_     then we were disciplining them too much  .  she also complained about the food we fed them     _comma_     the schools we sent them too     _comma_     and everything else under the sun  .  
ella    _comma_    it s been such a long week  .  i m ready to go out and party  .  hey    _comma_    let s go out for a night on the town  .  
 gosh   _comma_   you took all the word right out of my mouth  .  let s go out and get crazy tonight  .  
 let s go to the new club on west street  .  
 sure   _comma_   but what do i wear ? 
 you can wear that pretty red dress  .

 don t ask such a question  .  you know it has no certain answer  .  everyone knows it is in his heart  .

 maybe    _comma_    the whirligig of time    _comma_    who knows ? 
 right  .  
david   _comma_   i ’ m going to china  .

did you watch the final last night ? my favorite singer won ! 
 oh   _comma_   i love him too  .  he not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest  .  
 yeah    _comma_    he got booted after his initial performance in the audition    _comma_    but he did not give up  .  he then tried at another two auditions  .  
 he had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest  .  fortunately    _comma_    in the third audition    _comma_    he has won popularity among the audience  .  and that s when i started to notice him  .  
 me too  .  
 before he made the top three   _comma_   i was so nervous  .  i just fear that he might be knocked out  .  
 yeah   _comma_   there re so many excellent candidates out there  .  who knows which one will make it to the final ? 
 absolutely  .  that s why when he entered the final   _comma_   i was so excited  .  
 he really did a great job in the finale   _comma_   especially in the pk round  .  he performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him  .  
 and the host announced that he won it all ! 
come in   _comma_   come in ! 
 hi    _comma_    gary    _comma_    what happened ? i was waiting for you at the theater  .  why didn ’ t you meet me there ? 
 i thought we were supposed to meet here  .  
 don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? and we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven  .  then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment  .  
 i ’ m sorry  .  we must have misunderstood each other  .  
 why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? 
 you ’ re right  .  i am sorry  .  let ’ s go and watch the movie  .  
 it ’ s okay  .  i don ’ t want to go now  .  we ’ ve already missed ten minutes of the movie  .  i don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning  .  
excuse me   _comma_   i am a new student here  .  could you tell me where the english department is ?

 it is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells  .  
 where is the computer center ?

we have another traditional holiday the dragon boat festival  .  
 when is it ? 
 it falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month  .  
 could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ? 
 ok  .  the dragon boat festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named quyuan  .  on that day   _comma_   people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river  .  
 why do people eat rice cakes on that day ? 
 in order to prevent the fish from eating the poet s body  .  
 it sounds so moving  .  
nice to see you   _comma_   patrick  .  
 bob ! i hear your team won the match  .  
 yeah  .  all of us tried our best  .  
 congratulations ! 
i think you re being a little naive  .  
 if i want    _comma_    i can protect myself by paying through an escrow account    _comma_    which holds the money until i receive the item  .

 that s interesting  .  how often do you write a blog ? 
 it s random  .  if there happen to be a lot of things going on     _comma_     i may add several new entries in a week     _comma_     and if i ve got nothing to share     _comma_     i may leave my blog untouched for weeks  .

 i m sorry  .  i know it must have come as a great shock  .  
 the viewing was for saying goodbye   _comma_   and i didn t even get that  .  
i can ’ t bear it  .  the driver is too bad  .  
 he must be green  .  it ’ s lucky that we will get off soon  .  
i prefer potatoes to eggplants  .  
 i feel eggplants are more nutritious  .  
 but as a matter of fact   _comma_   potatoes taste better  .  
 oh   _comma_   that s how you see it  .  
that way they look longer  .  
 now what are you doing ? 
 putting on mascara  .  
 nasty  .  you d better not rub your eyes  .

 sorry    _comma_    i just worried about him  .  you know    _comma_    he should be here an hour ago  .  
 don ’ t worry him   _comma_   he has been grown up and i think he can take himself very well  .  
 but he still does not come back  .  
 maybe he is on the way home now  .  
how long have you been in england ? 
 for almost two years  .  
 almost two years ? your english is very good  .

the johnson are on their way back . you remember them   _comma_   don t you ? 
 johnson ? i can t place them  .  
 we met them in bermuda last may  .  
 they ve completely slipped my mind  .  
 the couple with the dogs   _comma_   think back  .

 well   _comma_   i ve invited them for brunch  .  
 hmm   _comma_   i must be getting absent minded  .  
his grandfather is the richest person in the area  .  
 what a miser ! he cycles to school every day  .  
 his grandfather s money is not his  .  
 i can t understand him anyway  .  
what did he say ? 
 he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man  .  
 it ’ s too good to be true ! if i were there   _comma_   i would ask him if he himself was a successful man  .  
 nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question   _comma_   you know  .  
i wonder what he looks like  .  oh    _comma_    i can t wait to see him ! his email said he d be wearing a white hat . oh    _comma_    there he is  .  
 hey   _comma_   isabelle  .

excuse me miao li  .  could you tell me who jackie chan is ? 
 certainly  .  jackie chan is a very famous movie star in hong kong  .  his chinese name is cheng long  .  
 ha    _comma_    i know cheng long a lot    _comma_    he has made    films since       .  and at that time he was promoted as the new bruce lee  .  but i m not familiar with his english name  .  
 ok  .  then tell me what else you know  .  
 some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make  .  do you know how jackie chan measures his worth ? 
 he measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film    _comma_    incredible stunts  .  by the way    _comma_    can you count the breaks ? 
 sure  .  his skull          _comma_          his eyes          _comma_          his nose          _comma_          three times          _comma_          his jaw          _comma_          his shoul der          _comma_          is chest          _comma_          two fingers          _comma_          a knee  .  as he said   everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet !   
 indeed you know much about him  .  
 this is because he is the action movie incarnate or action star extraordinaire around the world  .  
i m sorry   _comma_   but i can t find the book you lent me  .  
 oh   _comma_   that s all right  .  
 i must apologize  .  i ll buy you a new one tomorrow  .

 then we d better not go  .  
 ok  .  
are you ready to go shopping ? 
 not yet  .  i m not finished with my research yet  .  
 what research ? 
 reading my fashion magazines ! how do you think i know so much about all the latest trends ? 
 but they re just ads  .  
 duh  .  that s the point  .  the people in the ads are wearing what s in  .  plus   _comma_   there are articles on new trends  .  
is there anything worth watching on another channel ? 
 i think there ’ s a western on  .  
 do you mind if we watch it  .  i ’ d really like to see it  .  
 well   _comma_   i really wanted to see the football game  .  
 football game ? ok   _comma_   and you know what comes on next ?

 if i remember correctly   _comma_   it s a quiz show  .  
 do you want to watch it ? 
 let s watch it together  .  
well   _comma_   how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? 
 it was funny  .  
 tell me about it   _comma_   will you ? 
 well   _comma_   we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning  .  it was a magnificent sight  .  
 did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ? 
 sure     _comma_     we wouldn t miss it for anything  .  after that     _comma_     we took a short cut to the park  .  there was very little traffic     _comma_     so we got there in less than an hour  .  
 you were lucky then  .  what did you do after that ? 
 we went for a swim in the sea  .  that was the best part of the day  .  just look at my nice tan  .  
 so you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday  .  
 yes   _comma_   you re right  .  and i was so tired that i fell asleep on the way back  .  my arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday  .  
susan is going to get a divorce  .  
 how do you know that ? 
 she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh    _comma_    and she left this morning    _comma_    bag and baggage  .  
 oh   _comma_   i see  .  but i think you are making a fuss  .  they will make it up  .  bet it  .  
here s the course description guide  .  
 what do i do with it ? 
 do you want me to help you ? 
 please  .  
 look  .  here are the core classes  .  everyone has to take them  .  
 so i don t have to worry about them  .  
 you re catching on ! however     _comma_     there are elective courses like wood shop     _comma_     metal shop     _comma_     home economics  .  
 i ll take home economics  .  
 good  .  now you can pick classes by yourself  .  
well       _comma_       known       _comma_       jim       _comma_       i m  .  i m pretty much in favour of your computers       _comma_       i think computers teach kids to think       _comma_       because they require logical thoughts  .  
 but i  .  i don t agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids ability to thinkbecause kids don t learn basic skills  .  
 what do you mean ? 
 they can t spell     _comma_     they can t add     _comma_     they can t subtract     _comma_     they even don t remember any more  .  that s because they rely on gadgets  .  
 that s not the gadgets  .  creating programmes is stimulate thoughts  .  it engages their imagination and sharpen their mind  .  
ann   _comma_   do you have time next monday ? 
 yeah   _comma_   what ’ s up ? 
 next monday is my birthday   _comma_   and i would like you to attend my party  .  
 wow  .  i d love to  .  
 great ! 
 when and where ? 
 five o ’ clock that afternoon    _comma_    and in my place    _comma_    you know ? 
 yes   _comma_   i know  .  i appreciate your invitation  .  
 i am going to invite other guys  .  see you that day  .  
 see you  .  
hey stacy  .  what s going on ? 
 i m pretty tired these days  .  
 why ? you re not working so don t you have a lot of time on your hands ? 
 i have so much house work to do  .  i have to take care of the kids      _comma_      cook      _comma_      clean      _comma_      laundry      _comma_      and the cycle never ends  .  
 how about your husband  .  does he help much ? 
 not at all  .  he comes home and complains about his hard day at work  .  he expects me to do everything  .  he even wants me to feed him sometimes  .  can you believe that ? 
 that sucks  .  
 if he wasn t so lazy    _comma_    i think i wouldn t have any complaints  .  he mows the lawn    _comma_    but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ? 
 that s crossing the line  .  
 oh well  .  i ll have to live with it  .  what else can i do ? 
do you like watching the winter olympic games ? 
 of course  .  it s the tradition game in winter   _comma_   and with good reason  .  don t you like watching it ? 
 of course i do  .  i love it  .  all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable  .  
 that s true  .  for various reasons    _comma_    it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics  .  you know    _comma_    the low temperature may cause many problems  .  
 yeah  .  what s the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ? 
 when the olympic games started in modern times     _comma_     only summer events were included  .  when it grew popular     _comma_     there came the winter olympic games     _comma_     which includes a variety of winter sports  .  
 i see  .  then   _comma_   what s your favorite winter sport ? 
 figure skating  .  in my eye   _comma_   nothing beats it  .  
 then you must know shen due and hao hongbo  .  
 oh      _comma_      i didn t expect you to know them  .  but yes      _comma_      i love them not only because of many medals they ve won      _comma_      but also because of many medals they ve won      _comma_      but also because of their spirits  .  
 you should go to talk with may  .  she is a big fan of them too  .  
how do you arrange this summer vacation ? 
 i want to travel  .  
 where would you like to go ? 
 the seaside  .  
 that s really a good idea  .  taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good  .  i recommend you qingdao or dalian  .  
 i ’ ve been to qingdao before   _comma_   so i ’ ll choose dalian  .  i ve heard that the environment there is very good  .  
 yes   _comma_   that s a good place to spend a holiday  .  last year i went there  .  it s really  .  
 thank you ! 
would you care for something to drink   _comma_   mr  .  stone ? 
 no    _comma_    thank you    _comma_    mrs  .  carter  .  i m fine for now  .  
 just make yourself at home  .  the other guests should be arriving shortly  .  
i m dreadfully sorry for you  .  
 thank you very much for your kindness  .  
 is there any clue ? 
 no   _comma_   he left nothing  .  
very glad to know something about you   _comma_   then what are you going to do when you finish  .  
 oh   _comma_   i ’ ll go to shanghai to practice there  .  
 that ’ s a good idea  .  it must be easy to find a job in shanghai  .  
 i think so   _comma_   you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there  .  
 and english is very useful in your job  .  
 i think it will be very useful in many ways  .  beside      _comma_      shanghai is an important trade center      _comma_      not only in china      _comma_      but also in the world      _comma_      english is useful in almost all walks of life  .  
 you will be a very promising one  .  
 that ’ s my wish  .  
i hear you are expecting your family  .  
 yes    _comma_    my parents    _comma_    and soon my brother as well  .  
 i didn t know you had a brother  .  
 oh    _comma_    yes    _comma_    he is two years older than me  .  he lives in new zealand so i don t see him that often  .  
 oh   _comma_   nice  .  is he coming on his own or with the family ? 
 his son is coming as well  .  he wants to go to university here in england so they will visit a few universities while they are here  .  
 does your brother have just one son ? 
 no   _comma_   he has two daughters as well  .  his wife and daughters are visiting her parents  .  so i won t see them  .  
 i m sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson  .

 let s see  .  that was about six years ago  .  
 i bet that was interesting  .  what did you do there ? 
 i studied french  .  anyway  .  that s enough about me . how about you ? were you born in l  .  a  .  ? 
do you consider yourself a good mother ? 
 yes   _comma_   i m a very good mother and successful career woman  .  
 how can you manage to do both ? i mean   _comma_   it is so hard to be a working mother  .  
 i think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself      _comma_      like keeping housework simple      _comma_      spending money on things that make life easier      _comma_      buying yourself things you like      _comma_      and so on  .  you can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself  .  
 does your husband feel the same ? 
 yes  .  he is very understanding and supportive  .  
i find it really hard to express myself in class  .  i have lots of ideas   _comma_   but they never seem to come out of my mouth  .  
 let me give you a little advice  .  you know what the topics are going to be   _comma_   so prepares what you would like to say in advance  .  
 i often do   _comma_   but i ’ m worried about the responses from other people  .  
 you have to be realistic  .  not everyone is going to agree with you   _comma_   but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion  .  
 i ’ m worried that what i say will not make sense  .  
 we could chat about the topic before class  .  i could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking  .  
 that ’ s a good idea  .  what should i do if i am in two minds about a topic ? 
 that ’ s easy  .  express possibilities  .  people will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle  .  
 i didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy  .  
 the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say  .  they will reply to your statements   _comma_   but you can ’ t be sure how  .  
what s his job ? 
 he used to be a policeman  .  
 but mrs . smith hired him to find her lost son  .  
 yeah  .  he s a private eye now  .  
bother the flies ! 
 where do they come from ? 
 i don t know  .  something rotten here ? 
 i can t see it  .  
have you got your invitation yet ? 
 my invitation ? no   _comma_   i haven t  .  my invitation to what ? 
 the house warming party  .  
 whose house warming party is it ? 
 tom and bill smith  .  they are both working now you know ? and they ve bought a new house  .  
 oh   _comma_   they have ? i didn t know  .  i haven t seen tom lately  .  
 it s out in the suburbs  .  
 have you seen the house ? 
 yes   _comma_   i have  .  i went out with them last weekend  .  
 is it nice ? 
 yes      _comma_      it is  .  there are three bedrooms      _comma_      a living room      _comma_      a dining room      _comma_      and a big kitchen  .  
 there s also a garden  .  
 well   _comma_   that does sound nice  .  have they moved in yet ? 
 they are moving today  .  tom s taken the day off  .  he s rented a truck   _comma_   and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight  .  
 when are they going to have the party ? 
 next saturday night  .  you should get your invitation today or tomorrow  .  
 wow   _comma_   that would be something to look forward to  .  
hi   _comma_   darling ! i have a one month vacation saved up  .  how about a trip to europe ? 
 i could go for that  .  but i m afraid our budget is a little tight this year  .  
 oh   _comma_   but i really need to leave this town for a change  .  working day after day has worn me out  .  do you have any other suggestions ? 
 we should probably think about going somewhere that isn t too far away  .  how about the countryside ? there must be many interesting places   _comma_   and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec 
 wonderful ! i think that s a great idea  .  how soon until we can make this happen ? i can t wait ! 
 tomorrow i have an appointment with my dentist  .  what about next monday ? 
 perfect  .  i ll start preparing tomorrow  .  if we re going to drive   _comma_   i ll need to fill up the tank  .  
 no need  .  i think it s still plenty full  .  even so    _comma_    i d rather travel by bus or train  .  it would cost much less than driving  .  oil prices are soaring nowadays    _comma_    you know  .  
 we can take the train   _comma_   that will be faster  .  i ll book the tickets tomorrow morning  .  
 great ! oh    _comma_    one more thing    _comma_    don t forget to check the weather before we go  .  i d hate to get caught in the rain  .  
 no problem  .  i m really looking forward to the coming week  .  
 me   _comma_   too  .  now let s make a list for what we need to take with us  .  
hi   _comma_   kenny  .  let s go for a drink  .  
 sounds good  .  where are we going ? 
 somewhere new  .  it s a great place to pick up chicks  .  
 need a new  .  girlfriend   _comma_   huh ? 
 yeah    _comma_    i broke up with lisa . she blew a gasket over it  .  whoa    _comma_    get a load of that ! 
 whew ! that getup is terrific ! 
 never mind the getup . she   s beautiful ! 
 that too  .  
 i m gonna introduce myself  .  
 if you re lucky   _comma_   that might do the trick  .  
 oh    _comma_    oh    _comma_    that tears it ! i m getting out of here  .  
 hold on ! what s the big hurry ? 
 my ex girlfriend s here . if she sees me   _comma_   my goose is cooked  .  
 i wanna finish my drink first  .  i ll meet you at sammy s  .  
 ok   _comma_   catch you later  .  
valerie ! hi ! wow how are you ? it ’ s been such a long time ! 
 darlene ! indeed    _comma_    it ’ s been a while ! how have you been ? wow    _comma_    you look amazing ! i love what you ’ ve done with your hair ! 
 really ? thanks ! i went to that hair salon that you told me about   _comma_   but enough about me ! look at you ! you haven ’ t aged a day since the last time i saw you ! what is your secret ! 
 ha ha      _comma_      come on ! well      _comma_      i ’ ve been watching what i eat      _comma_      and working out three times a week  .  by the way      _comma_      i heard your son recently graduated ! 
 yes   _comma_   my little paul is finally a doctor  .  they grow up so fast you know  .  
 he is such a handsome guy  .  he gets his looks from his mother of course ! 
 thank you ! what about your daughter   _comma_   pamela ? i heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently  .  
 oh yes  .  she had a beautiful wedding in cozumel mexico and we all attended  .  
 such a lovely girl  .  i hope my paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! 
 but of course ! well    _comma_    it ’ s been great talking to you    _comma_    but i have to get going  .  
 same here ! we will catch up soon   _comma_   maybe over coffee ! 
 that would be great ! give me a call ! 
 see you soon ! bye ! egg  .  i can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter  .  
did you already take the history exam ? 
 yeah  .  it was hard  .  when do you take it ? 
 i take it tomorrow morning  .  there is so much material that i dont know what to emphasize on  .  what types of questions did you get ? 
 mostly on the civil war  .  you should also study the impact martin luther king jr  .  had on american society  .  
 what about abraham lincoln ? did you get any questions about him ? 
 i only had   question about him  .  but you might get more  .  i dont know if he will have the same exam or not  .  
 hopefully he will use the same exam   _comma_   cause im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war  .  it is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class  .  
 if you cant study everything   _comma_   then that is probably the best way to go  .  
 aright  .  thanks for the info  .  i gotta go to the library now  .  
 good luck  .  
 thanks  .  see ya  .  
what s the matter with you   _comma_   then ? you look miserable  .  
 it s us  .  
 what do you mean by   us   ? 
 well   _comma_   we used to talk to each other before we were married  .  remember ? 
 what do you mean ? we   re talking now   _comma_   aren t we ? 
 oh    _comma_    yes    _comma_    but we used to do so much together  .  
 yes  .  i remember  .  but we never used to argue  .  you used to think i was wonderful  .  where are you going ? 
 back to live with my parents  .  that s something else i used to do before we were married  .  remember ? 
hey   _comma_   blake ! are you still listening to mozart ? 
 yes . do you like it ? 
 it s great  .  and i   ve heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent  .  
 really ? i ve never heard that before  .  i just like it  .  
 is classical music your favorite ? 
 yes  .  what about you ? 
 i like pop music best  .  classical music is a bit too heavy for me  .  i can t get fully relaxed in it  .  
 pop music doesn t have any depth for me  .  
 yeah   _comma_   that s why i can enjoy myself in it  .  
 did you always like pop music  .  
 i think so   _comma_   since i was in primary school  .  how long have you been interested in classical music  .  
 i didn t like it at all until i started to learn violin when i was eight  .  from then on  .  classical music has been an important part of my life  .  
 oh   _comma_   i didn t know you can play the violin  .  do you still play  .  
 sometimes   _comma_   but these days i m often too busy  .  
it was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young  .  
 most people were living form hand to mouth  .  how could they ? 
 yeah  .  they simply had no extra money to save up or for other things  .  
 fortunately   _comma_   things are changing these years  .  
jane   _comma_   i was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon  .  
 a friend and i are planing to go out   _comma_   why ? what s up ? 
 there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum   _comma_   i was hoping you   d like to come with me  .  
 i am afraid i can t i am going to be out all day  .  
 what about sunday ? 
 i wish i could   _comma_   but it s my mums birthday  .  
 maybe next week  .  
 much as i   d like to    _comma_    i am afraid i wont be free next week    _comma_    i have a lot of work  .  
 sorry to hear that    _comma_    i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you    _comma_    i really enjoyed our last chat  .  
 i am really sorry too   _comma_   maybe i can give you a call sometime  .  
have any plans for the weekend   _comma_   tom ? 
 yeah   _comma_   i ’ m going for a hike in the southern rocky mountains  .  
 oh   _comma_   do you go hiking often ? 
 i go as much as i can  .  i love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature  .  
 it would be nice to get out of the city  .  do you want some company ? 
 sure  .  but    _comma_    it will be a long hike    _comma_       miles in three days  .  have you been hiking before ? 
 yeah   _comma_   i go a lot too  .  i saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike  .  
 wow ! you must have been pretty far away from the city  .  
 yeah   _comma_   my friend and i hiked in a very wild part of the national forest  .  
 well   _comma_   bring him along too  .  we ’ ll have a great time this weekend  .  
 thanks   _comma_   i ’ ll ask him  .  
how upsetting ! he has been away for a week ! 
 i don t know if anything terrible has happened  .  
 i have reported it to the police  .  
 we d better prepare for the worst  .  
you ve heard of bruce jenner   _comma_   haven t you ? 
 he won the decathlon in the      olympics   _comma_   right ? 
 i read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles  .  
 i can think of better things to dream about  .  
 sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat   _comma_   with his legs pumping away  .  
 that s crazy  .  
mike ! look at the floor ! 
 what s wrong with it ? 
 what s wrong with it ? it s filthy ! 
 oh  .  
 it s filthy because you never wipe your shoes  .  
 sorry   _comma_   love  .  
 what are you looking for now ? 
 my cigarettes  .  
 well   _comma_   they   re not here . they are in the dustbin  .  
 in the dustbin ! why didn t you tell me before ? 
excuse me  .  do you study chinese at this university ? 
 yes   _comma_   i do  .  but my characters are very bad  .  
 it takes a long time to learn chinese writing  .  
 are you chinese by birth ? 
 yes   _comma_   i am  .  i am from guangzhou  .  i am here to study international relations  .  
 how do you like it ? 
 i like it so far  .  but my english still needs work  .  
 i want to study mandarin and public relations  .  
hey   _comma_   look over there  .  it seems that there is something interesting going on  .  let s go and have a look  .  
 sure  .  it s probably a skiing show  .  adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors  .  
 look at that  .  it s so dangerous  .  my mom would never allow me to do that  .  
 stop all this fuss and enjoy the show  .  
 you are right  .  but what if an avalanche happened ? 
 they are all great skiers and very experienced  .  so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim  .  
 anyway    _comma_    the show is breathtaking  .  by the way    _comma_    where did they get so much snow here ? 
 well   _comma_   they have the most advanced snowmaking machine  .  
 do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? 
 it s possible  .  
you ll never guess what i won at work today !   tickets to tonight s final nba game  .  
 two   _comma_   i hope and i hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me ! 
 of course ! and here s the best part   _comma_   they are court side seats ! 
 how in the world ! who came up with seats like that from your company ? 
 some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team ! 
 can t beat that ! thank you accounting guy ! 
 the game starts at seven so we d better hustle   _comma_   it s already five  .  
 what are we waiting for ? let s go ! 
let ’ s play a game ! 
 ok ! how about scrabble ? 
 no     _comma_     no     _comma_     a friend of mine taught me this really fun game  .  i ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face     _comma_     and you guess who it is ! 
 ok ! 
 let ’ s see  .  he has a roman nose   _comma_   bushy eyebrows and dimples ! 
 our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a pointy nose   _comma_   sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! 
 aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok    _comma_    my turn  .  he has a crooked nose and full lips  .  he has quite a few freckles and an oval face  .  oh    _comma_    he is also bald ! 
 your future husband ! 
 not funny  .  
as we know   _comma_   mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives  .  
 it bears a great many of advantages   _comma_   but also some weak points  .  
 is it ? i ve never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone  .  
 for instance   _comma_   the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study  .  
 that s true  .  some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones  .  
 actually    _comma_    it s not the fault of the mobile phone  .  but people should have a proper attitude towards it  .  mobile phone is a tool serving people    _comma_    not the fetters restricting them  .  
lee   _comma_   i m going to get married next month  .  
 good news ! and congratulations ! 
 you are invited to my wedding  .  
 thank you  .  i ll certainly be there  .  
thank you for lending me the book  .  
 sure  .  but it s a very difficult one   _comma_   you need to have a dictionary at your elbow  .  
 but i m not used to looking up every new word when i m reading a novel  .  i only look up the most necessary ones  .  
don ’ t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ? 
 i ’ m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it  .  
 don ’ t you think in that case   _comma_   there wouldn ’ t be so much stealing ? 
 definitely  .  but i think it is too fierce  .  
the bartender just gave the last call  .  let s order another round   _comma_   okay ? 
 sure   _comma_   but let s get a pitcher this time we should be able to down it before they close  .  
 that sounds good  .  you order the beer while i go to the bathroom  .  where is the can in this place ? 
 it s all the way to the back  .  see that yellow door ? 
 yeah  .  i think i can find it  .  
 you re back already  .  that sure was quick  .  
 that s because i just took one step inside and turned right around  .  that bathroom is too gross for me  .  
 well   _comma_   the bartender wouldn t give me the pitcher of beer  .  anyway  .  he said it was too close to closing time  .  
 let s leave then  .  i could take some fresh air   _comma_   anyway  .  
 okay   _comma_   let s go ! 
hi   _comma_   mary ! what do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 well   _comma_   i spend a lot of time watching movies  .  
 what a confidence ! i always watch a lot of movies   _comma_   too  .  
 oh really   _comma_   frank ? what kind of movies do you like ? 
 actually     _comma_     i watch whichever movie there is     _comma_     be it a comedy     _comma_     a sci fi or a suspense movie  .  how about you ? 
 art films are my favorite    _comma_    but thrillers are cool    _comma_    too  .  
 really impressive  .  these two genres are totally different  .  
 sure  .  i enjoy both of them very much  .  
 how often do you go to the cinema ? 
 once in a while    _comma_    i suppose    _comma_    i usually rent movies at movie salon  .  
 movie salon ? where is that ? 
 it s a movie rental store in my neighborhood  .  i ve got a membership there  .  
 is it good ? 
 yes   _comma_   you can find almost all new releases there  .  
 really ? maybe i shall also sign up for its membership  .  
 why not ? 
hey suzie  .  guess what ? i m having a baby ! 
 really ? that s so great  .  congratulations  .  
 thanks  .  i m so excited  .  we ve been trying for   months now  .  
 that s really exciting  .  how many months are you pregnant ? 
 three months  .  
 are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ? 
 i want to   _comma_   but bob doesn t  .  he wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way  .  
 maybe it s more exciting not knowing  .  
 i d rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time  .  
 there are so many things you have to prepare for  .  
 i know i am going to be busy   _comma_   but i know i can handle it  .  i have been looking forward to this day for a long long time  .  
 it really must be an exciting time for you guys  .  
 thank you so much  .  
mary seems depressed  .  what ’ s the matter ? 
 she didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work  .  
 poor girl ! 
believe it or not   _comma_   one of the narrowest street in the world is only   cm wide  .  
 unbelievable ! how do people go through it ? 
 that s what i m wondering   _comma_   too  .  
 i wish i had a chance to see it with my own eyes  .  
would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ? 
 much to my regret   _comma_   i ll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then  .  
 we d like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening   _comma_   are you free ? 
 much as we d like to   _comma_   but we ve booked up already for that time  .  
 what a pity ! you can t join us  .  
 so sorry  .  next time we ll go   _comma_   thanks anyway  .  
i d like to invite you to dinner tonight   _comma_   do you think have time ? 
 thank you for your inition  .  i m free tonight  .  
 which kind of food do you like    _comma_    chinese food    _comma_    western food or sea food ? 
 i prefer sea food  .  
 ok  .  i ll pick up your hotel at   thirty pm  .  
 that s fine  .  i ll be waiting for you  .  
 see you later  .  
 bye  .  
look ! i bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already  .  
 if that happen to me   _comma_   i ’ ll take them back to the shop  .  
 i did  .  but they said they won ’ t change them  .  
 that ’ s terrible  .  but if they wouldn ’ t change them   _comma_   i know what i would do  .  
do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? 
 of course ! it is the no  .    stressor in my life  .  you know job stress has become a very common problem these days  .  so we must learn to cope with it  .  
 totally agree  .  what is your solution ? 
 well      _comma_      there are two causes of job stress  .  one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition  .  so if we want to manage job stress      _comma_      both we and the companies should do something  .  for me      _comma_      i am trying to balance work and leisure time  .  you know      _comma_      all work and no play make jack a dull boy  .  
 you seem to have a very relaxed outlook  .  
 it is necessary  .  positive attitude helps to prevent stress  .  
 but i don ’ t think we can change our working condition  .  anyway   _comma_   we are not the bosses  .  
 i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them   _comma_   like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities  .  our boss is a smart person  .  he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team  .  
i am so busy today  .  
 can i help you ? 
 i ’ m not sure  .  perhaps you could do the shopping  .  
 i ’ ll be glad to help  .  
 or maybe make the beds  .  
 all you have to do is ask for help  .  
 thanks  .  that ’ s terrific ! 
 i ’ m ready and willing to help  .  
the restaurant across the street hired a new chinese chef   _comma_   so i ordered some chinese food there for this evening  .  
 good  .  i love chinese food  .  what did you order ? 
 something hot and spicy  .  they look very inviting on the menu  .  you are going to love them  .  
 maybe we can find a place to learn some chinese cooking  .  i hear there s a place in chinatown where you can take some courses  .  are you interested ? 
 i m not sure  .  i don t enjoy cooking that much  .  as long as we can order it from a restaurant   _comma_   we don t have to learn to do it by ourselves  .  
 you are right  .  but i just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different  .  
you don t look too well  .  maybe you should take the day off from work  .  
 i couldn t do that  .  i have an important meeting to go to today  .  
 do you feel ok ? 
 not really  .  after a      hour flight     _comma_     i ve got jetlag     _comma_     and on top of that     _comma_     i think i ve also got the flu  .  
 why don t you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? you should really get some rest or you ll end up feeling even worse than you do now  .  
 could you feel my forehead and check to see if i have a fever ? 
 you re really hot  .  let me get you some tylenol to bring the fever down  .  
 ok  .  i ll stay home this morning and rest    _comma_    but if i feel better in the afternoon    _comma_    i m going to the meeting  .  
 zach   _comma_   what s that on your arm ? 
 i don t know  .  it looks a bit red   _comma_   but i m sure it s nothing  .  
 it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! are you allergic to anything ? 
 just cats   _comma_   but i don t think i was near any cats in the last couple of weeks  .  
 i completely forgot about your cat allergy  .  i took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago  .  oh no  .  we d better go to the doctor and get some medicine  .  let s go  .  
 shouldn t we make an appointment first ? 
 we would   _comma_   but let s just go and see if there s an opening now before it gets worse  .  
 whatever you say  .  i just want to get to my meeting ! 
i can t go to your party  .  
 that s too bad  .  
do you like being a doctor ? 
 yes    _comma_    most of the time  .  but    _comma_    sometimes things can get difficult  .  
 can you tell me about it ? 
 you know   _comma_   sometimes patients can get very unreasonable  .  they may insist they are sick when they are not  .  
 what can you do when this happens ? 
 not much   _comma_   usually i ll just keep silent  .  
have you eaten ? 
 not yet  .  
it s too hot to read  .  
 we d better go out for a walk  .  
 which season do you like best ? 
 spring  .  
 how about summer ? 
 i dislike it most  .  
 why ? 
 because the hottest season is summer in a year  .  
 but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons  .  
my son came home from three years in the navy  .  
 it was a real red letter day for you  .  
 yeah  .  we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home  .  
john   _comma_   my father isn t there at all  .  are you kidding ? 
 cool     _comma_     fellow     _comma_     what s the date today     _comma_     buddy ? 
 it s  .  oh it s the  st april   _comma_   april fool s day  .  
 you forgot all of about it   _comma_   didn t you ? 
i must be going  .  
 okay  .  keep in touch  .  
hi   _comma_   i made a reservation for a mid size vehicle  .  the name is jimmy fox  .  
 i ’ m sorry   _comma_   we have no mid size available at the moment  .  
 i don ’ t understand    _comma_    i made a reservation    _comma_    do you have my reservation ? 
 yes    _comma_    we do    _comma_    unfortunately we ran out of cars  .  
 but the reservation keeps the car here  .  that ’ s why you have the reservation  .  
 i know why we have reservations  .  
 i don ’ t think you do . if you did      _comma_      i ’ d have a car . see      _comma_      you know how to take the reservation      _comma_      you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation      _comma_      the holding  .  anybody can just take them  .  
 but we do have a compact or an suv if you ’ d like  .  
 fine  .  i ’ ll take the compact  .  
 alright  .  we have a blue ford focus for you   _comma_   mr  .  fox  .  would you like insurance ? 
 yeah    _comma_    you better give me the insurance    _comma_    because i am gonna beat the hell out of this car  .  
do you think tom will be elected president ? 
 no   _comma_   i think harry will get it  .  
 let s make a bet on who gets it  .  
 ok   _comma_   loser buys pizza tomorrow night  .  
i met a girl in elevator this morning  .  she works in a company upstairs  .  she said she envied the casual way we dress for work  .  she complained about the dress rule in her company  .  it requires everyone to wear formal clothes from monday to friday  .  
 well    _comma_    i was wondering where those people with professional attire come from  .  now    _comma_    i know the answer  .  
 you know      _comma_      in a sense      _comma_      a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in july      _comma_      and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees  .  even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule      _comma_      isn ’ t that strict ? 
 to some extent     _comma_     it is  .  anyway     _comma_     whether they like it or not     _comma_     they do give people a very good impression  .  
 but it is unjust to judge a book by its cover  .  if they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes   _comma_   they can be less productive  .  
what happened ? why didn t he win ? 
 didn t you hear ? he was disqualified  .  
 how did that happen ? he s so talented ! i thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! 
 if he didn t have any drug problems   _comma_   he would have won  .  
 what ? what kind of drugs was he using ? 
 he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster  .  
 i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs  .  
 they are  .  the only reason they didn t disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards  .  
 that s so disappointing  .  i don t know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs  .  
 i don t think it s right   _comma_   but i can understand why they might  .  imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! 
 regardless of how much pressure you re under   _comma_   there s never a good reason to take drugs  .  
 i agree  .  hopefully with the new regulations   _comma_   fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs  .  
 let s hope so  .  
cindy   _comma_   how come nearly all the prime time tv shows are comedies ? 
 that s because americans love sitcoms  .  
 sitcoms ? 
 situation comedies  .  a sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly  .  sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people  .  if there is one thing that all the shows have in common   _comma_   it is teaching wholesome values  .  
 in taiwan   _comma_   prime time shows are an hour long and most of them aren t comedies  .  
 i think americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time  .  
are you interested in history ? 
 yes     _comma_     i am  .  i enjoyed studying it at school     _comma_     though i had trouble remembering all the dates     _comma_     so my teacher never gave me good marks  .  
 i love history   _comma_   but i ’ ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened  .  
 i wish you had been my history teacher ! i might have got better marks ! 
 some people say that history repeats itself  .  
 what does that mean ? the same events never happen twice   _comma_   do they ? 
 the idea is that the people and dates change   _comma_   but the reason why things happen stay the same  .  
 i see  .  i think i ’ d agree with that statement  .  people often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again  .  
you re looking great  .  
 you   _comma_   too  .  
what s the matter   _comma_   john ? you seemed to be restless today  .  
 you see   _comma_   i ve been offered a new job  .  i can t decide whether to take it or not  .  
 oh    _comma_    that s easy  .  if it s better than the one you are doing now    _comma_    go for it  .  that s my advice  .  
 it isn t that easy  .  i hate to quit my present job  .  people around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging  .  
 then what about the salary ? would you get more ? 
 yes   _comma_   they say i would get a big sum  .  
 have you discussed it with your wife ? 
 yes   _comma_   she leaves it to me  .  
 as i say it the work is well worth try  .  after all you can get a higher salary  .  
 i have to think about it  .  
sybil  .  is that spelt with an i or a y ? 
 both actually  .  s      _comma_      y      _comma_      b      _comma_      i      _comma_      l  .  
 of course  .  
i see mike farmer has make it into the olympic team  .  he beat the national record by   .   of a second  .  
 that ’ s great  .  he ’ s the best runner i ’ ve seen this season  .  i ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the olympics  .  
 i think you ’ re right  .  i think we have a very good athletics team  .  they should do well in the olympics  .  how many medals do you think we ’ ll win ? 
 i really don ’ t know  .  i don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals   _comma_   but i think we should win several silver and bronze ones  .  
 what do you think our chance are in other events  .  
 in the last olympics    _comma_    we did very well in swimming    _comma_    cycling and ball sports  .  i think we ’ ll do well in those same events  .  
 we might get a gold medal in the sailing too  .  our team put in a lot of practice  .  
 i think we can expect to get between    to    medals in total  .  
 you are very optimistic ! 
helen   _comma_   did you hear i ’ m having a party ? next saturday in my place  .  
 i may have something on that day   _comma_   but thanks for inviting me  .  
 well   _comma_   drop by if you can  .  
 i will   _comma_   do you want me to bring anything ? 
 no   _comma_   just bring yourself  .  i hope to see you there  .  
it s said that john s broken up  .  
 really ? but his wife has always waited on him hand and foot  .  
 i hear that john s leading a double wife  .  
 it s very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife  .  
let s play chess  .  
 i haven t played chess for a long time  .  
 that s all right   _comma_   i m a beginner  .  i ve just learnt how to play  .  
 look   _comma_   there s a chessboard  .  those two men have already finished playing  .  
 you re a very good player 
 not really   _comma_   but once i won a prize  .  
 so did i  .  i won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners  .  
 my prize was for the best player in the country  .  now let s start playing chess seriously  .  
you have been here for how long ? four months now ? 
 yeah   _comma_   about  .  
 do you know chinese better now ? 
 oh     _comma_     definitely  .  i remember     _comma_     when i first arrived in guangzhou     _comma_     my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone  .  
 oh   _comma_   yeah  .  many chinese like to bargain  .  it happens almost everywhere  .  
 i mean    _comma_    i understand that  .  but the speed of the conversation got faster and faster    _comma_    until it seemed to me that they would fight  .  my perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match  .  the truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation  .  
 a shouting match ? you ’ re so funny  .  you must be exaggerating  .  i don ’ t believe it  .  
 i am not exaggerating at all  .  i ’ m telling you the truth  .  that was how i felt at that time  .  
 yes   _comma_   perhaps  .  chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing  .  maybe it ’ s quite natural to us  .  
 yes   _comma_   absolutely true  .  
excuse me   _comma_   can you tell me the name of the book you read ? 
 harry potter  .  
 harry potter ? is that book funny ? 
 actually     _comma_     the language itself is not so funny     _comma_     but you can imagine the scene     _comma_     that s funny  .  
 got it  .  
 have you ever read this book before ? 
 no   _comma_   but my little brother likes it very much  .  
 it s really a good book  .  you will like it too  .  
 i ll try to read it  .  actually   _comma_   i like literature very much  .  
 wow    _comma_    that sounds like a scholar  .  by the way    _comma_    who s your favorite writer ? 
 jane austen  .  
 me too  .  pride and prejudice is my favorite  .  
 i like it too  .  but sense and sensibility is my favorite  .  
oh    _comma_    it s getting late  .  i ve got to run  .  it was nice talking to you    _comma_    karren  .  
 thanks    _comma_    tim . nice meeting you    _comma_    too  .  
 i guess we ll see just around  .  
 ye   _comma_   i hope so . well . take it easy  .  
 you too  .  
hey sandra   _comma_   what s wrong ? you look furious ! 
 i ve had it with tim ! i think i m going to quit ! 
 but sandra  .  you love your job ! you spent months trying to get this position  .  it s perfect for you ! 
 yeah  .  i know  .  but i m sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! 
 what kind of power struggles are you talking about ? 
 basically   _comma_   i think tim is threatened by me  .  i m doing a better job than he is so he s trying to sabotage my career ! 
 so he talks about you behind your back ? 
 yes  .  he s all nice and friendly to my face  .  but the second i turn around he stabs me in the back ! 
 i had a worker like that once  .  she was always taking credit for my ideas  .  
 i should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary i can prove it was my effort  .  
 my co worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits  .  she liked to name drop  .  we would be in a meeting and she would say   _comma_   yesterday i was chatting with tom  .  she meant tom solomon  .  our ceo  .  
doris   _comma_   i m glad you re home  .  i m terrified  .  i don t know what to do ! 
 what is it ? what happened ? 
 i think someone is stalking me  .  
 no   _comma_   it can t be  .  really ? who ? 
 i don t know  .  i saw him the first time tuesday  .  he was at the cafe  .  i noticed he was looking at me a lot  .  not just the usual looking   _comma_   but staring . he just kept staring at me  .  he didn t stop  .  
 what did you do ? 
 i didn t do anything  .  finally   _comma_   he left . but then i saw him again today  .  outside the shoe store  .  near the cafe  .  i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd s  .  but then he came in too  .  
 did he leave when you left ? 
 yes  .  then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me  .  he was following me  .  
 what did you do ? 
man   _comma_   i m hungry  .  do you know a good place to have lunch ? 
 yes   _comma_   i know a great place  .  what types of food do you like ? 
 mexican   _comma_   japanese or chinese would be great  .  
 oh   _comma_   i know a place where you might like to eat  .  
 is it close by ? 
 it s down a block on the right ; can i show you the way ? 
 ok   _comma_   i d love the company  .  
 this will work out well  .  i m getting hungry just thinking about it  .  
have you ever been to disneyworld ? 
 when i was young   _comma_   my parents took me to the one in california  .  i always forget which — is that one disneyland or disneyworld ? 
 the one in florida is disneyworld and the one in california is disneyland   _comma_   so you must have been to disneyland  .  
 that s right  .  why do you ask ? 
 well   _comma_   i ve never been to either so i was thinking of going to disneyworld for my honeymoon  .  
 when are you getting married ? 
 some time next year  .  we haven t set the date yet  .  
 congratulations ! i had no idea  .  
 thank you  .  so what do you think ? would we have a good time ? 
 do you like amusement parks ? 
 for the most part    _comma_    yes  .  some of the rides are bit too scary for me    _comma_    though  .  
 if you don t think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can   _comma_   you ll have a good time  .  
 even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? 
 even those  .  it ll be very romantic   _comma_   i think  .  you ll have loads of fun  .  
 thanks for the advice  .  i ll talk to my fiance about it tonight  .  
 i m sure he ll love the idea  .  just throw yourself into it and you ll enjoy it ! 
matthew ? hi !

 mrs  .  thou ? 
 yes     _comma_     her daughter s having a baby     _comma_     so she s moving in with her to help out  .  i think if you are interested     _comma_     you can come over and have a look  .  
 great  .  it s a lovely neighborhood  .  and it would be nice to be neighbors again  .  it would be just like the old days ! 
 i ll ask mrs  .  thou when she s available to show the apartment and let you know  .  has your number changed ? 
are you ready to go to the mall ? 
 yeah  .  dig my new pants ? 
 copycat ! 
 what do you mean ? 
 you went out and bought khakis   _comma_   too ! 
 no  .  mine are a soft brown  .  yours are khaki  .  
 whatever  .  
have heard of paul ? 
 no   _comma_   what ? 
 he s got a promotion  .  
 you re kidding  .  
 no   _comma_   they made him vicepresident in charge of sells  .  
 i don t believe it . he is only being with the company for two years  .  
 well   _comma_   it s true . the board man last thirdly and they choice paul  .  
 well . good for him  .  
jeff   _comma_   i m going to the supermarket  .  do you want to come with me ? 
 i think the supermarket is closed now  .  
 oh   _comma_   when does it close ? 
 it closes at  :   on sundays  .  
 that s too bad  .  
 don t worry   _comma_   we can go tomorrow morning  .  it opens at  :     .  
 alright  .  what do you want to do now ? 
 let s take a walk for a half an hour  .  my sister will get here at about  :   pm and then we can all go out to dinner  .  
 where does she live ? 
 she lives in san francisco  .  
 how long has she lived there ? 
 i think she s lived there for about    years  .  
 that s a long time  .  where did she live before that ? 
 san diego  .  
hey    _comma_    peter    _comma_    have you had lunch yet ? 
 no  .  how about you ? 
 not yet  .  let s go to that restaurant on the corner  .  
who s that ? 
 search me  .  
i had a big argument with david yesterday  .  i hope he ’ s not still mad at me  .  
 what did you argue about ? 
 he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back  .  he said he didn ’ t have the money yet  .  
 well   _comma_   he should pay you back  .  it ’ s only fair  .  
 yes   _comma_   but i got angry with him too quickly  .  he probably thought that i mistrusted him  .  i shouldn ’ t have got angry  .  
 did you lend him a lot of money ? 
 not much  .  i had to pay an unexpected bill   _comma_   so i needed the money back  .  
 well    _comma_    talk to him about it next time you see him  .  he probably feels as bad about it as you do  .  close friends sometimes have disagreements  .  it ’ s nothing unusual  .  neither of you said anything really nasty    _comma_    did you ? 
 no   _comma_   we didn ’ t  .  i guess you ’ re right  .  we should patch things up  .  
 of course you should  .  you wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship   _comma_   would you ? 
did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? the person who wrote that must be crazy  .  
 i don ’ t think so  .  i think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking  .  
 maybe so  .  but a law banning cigarettes will do no good  .  
 no    _comma_    you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal    _comma_    but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres  .  
do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ? 
 yes  .  dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart  .  they are also the fastest swimmers in the world  .  
 they must be amazing animals  .  
 they are  .  i read a story about a dolphin saving a a from drowning in the sea  .  
 i read that story too  .  they seem to be able to understand men  .  
 they sure can  .  maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes  .  
oh dear   _comma_   my weight has gone up again  .  
 i am not surprised   _comma_   you eat too much  .  
 and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn t help  .  
 no   _comma_   i wouldn t think so  .  
 i do wish i could lose weight  .  
 well   _comma_   why don t you go on the diet ? 
 i ve tried diets before but they ve never worked  .  
 perhaps you should excercise more  .  why don t you go to an exercise class  .  
 yes   _comma_   maybe i should  .  
could you please wait for a minute ? i ll buy the tickets 
 all right  .  
 here is your ticket  .  
 thank you  .  
 the park will close soon  .  we should better go in right now  .  
 really ? 
 yes   _comma_   let s go in  .  
 it is a new park   _comma_   isn t it ? 
 yes   _comma_   how do you know ? 
 i guessed it  .  
 well     _comma_     generally speaking     _comma_     the park is a window on the world history     _comma_     a window on the world civilization and a window on the world s tourist attractions as well  .  
 oh   _comma_   how wonderful ! 
i was just watching a documentary on tv about how people use dogs for various purpose  .  it was very interesting  .  
 i love dogs  .  they have been used as guards for centuries  .  nowadays   _comma_   they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers  .  
 the documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow  .  
 horses are useful to people too  .  we use them for sports and recreation  .  
 don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts  .  
 can you ride a horse ? 
 yes   _comma_   i can  .  i don ’ t ride regularly though  .  how about you ? 
 i can ride too  .  perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? 
 what a good idea ! 
where s mrs  .  johnson ? 
 just call her lisa   _comma_   mary  .  she s cooking dinner  .  
 i see  .  can i sit down ? 
 of course ! make yourself at home  .

 no   _comma_   what ? 
 he s got a promotion  .  
 you re kidding  .  
 no   _comma_   they made him vicepresident in charge of sells  .  
 oh   _comma_   i don t believe it  .  he is only being with the company for two years  .  
 well   _comma_   it s true  .  the board man last thirdly and they choice paul  .  
 well  .  good for him  .  
let s speed up  .  we re going to be late again  .  
 if we hurry   _comma_   can we get there in time ? 
 i hope so  .

 our neighbor    _comma_    bruce    _comma_    will take part in the relay race  .  let s go have a look  .  
 ok   _comma_   let s go  .  
 the competition will begin in   minutes   _comma_   it s tense here  .  
 wonderful   _comma_   bruce is taking the lead  .  
 other competitors have almost caught up with him  .  they are neck and neck  .  
 come on    _comma_    bruce  .  come on    _comma_    bruce  .  
 wow   _comma_   bruce crossed the line first  .  
tim ’ s smiles are interesting  .  
 yes   _comma_   they are shy and gentle but very powerful  .  
 you are right  .  they sweep nancy off her feet  .  and now she fell head over heels in love with him  .  
 how wonderful it would be if i had such smiles ! 
have you enjoyed your weekend ? 
 yes   _comma_   it s been marvelous  .  it really was very kind of you to invite me  .  i hope it hasn t been too much trouble  .  
 not at all  .  we ve really enjoyed having you  .  i hope you ll come and stay again next time you re in changsha  .  
the great wall is a great attraction for visitors  .  
 it s a man made wonder  .  i ve seen it many times in textbooks and it s part of my dream to visit it  .  
 someone claimed it was one of the two man made wonders that could be seen on the moon  .  
 that s true  .  
i ’ m forming a music band  .  
 do you already know how to play an instrument ? 
 uh  .  yeah ! i ’ ve told you a thousand times that i ’ m learning to play the drums  .  now that i know how to play well   _comma_   i would like to form a rock band  .  
 aside from yourself   _comma_   who are the other members of the band ? 
 we have a guy who plays guitar    _comma_    and another who plays bass  .  although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer  .  you told me that you had some musical talent    _comma_    right ? 
 yes   _comma_   i ’ m a singer  .

 well     _comma_     lili     _comma_     we can visit different places in the state in our van     .  we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time  .  trust me     _comma_     it won ’ t cost much  .

 you might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on december  th  .  do you have a ride ? 
 yes   _comma_   someone is picking me up  .

 not at the moment — maybe later   _comma_   though  .  
 all of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway  .  see you on monday ! 
the acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot  .  
 i m sorry for hero  .  
 i don t think there s any excuse for his acting in some parts  .  
 don t be too critical  .  we can t expect it to be perfect  .  
how was your business trip ? 
 great   they wined and dined us all week  .  
nice to meet you here . how come you dropped into this company today ? 
 my boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office  .  i didn t know you were working here . what a surprise . how long have you been doing this ? 
 two years or so  .  
 that is great . do you have to work the night shift ? 
 no   _comma_   in most cases i don t have to unless there is something urgent to deal with  .  i work five days a week  .  
 do you enjoy work here ? 
 it is hard to say . but i ve to start by working as a trainee before i really become an experienced marketing assistant . sometimes   _comma_   i am really under great pressure when it gets busy  .  
 take it easy  .  i m sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant  .  i hope you haven t been given much trouble in the job  .  
 luckily not . the silent i meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss  .  
 glad to hear that  .  
scientists have found a second solar system in the universe  .  
 what s the second solar system ? 
 it s just a system like ours   _comma_   with a star and a number of planets going around it  .  
 is this good news or bad news ? 
 it s exciting news ! if we find a second solar system   _comma_   we might find a second earth ! 
 you mean with people on it ? 
 yes ! isn t that exciting ? 
why didn t you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
 sorry   _comma_   i thought you knew  .  
 but you should tell me you were in love with her  .  
 didn t i ? 
 you know you didn t  .  
 well   _comma_   i am telling you now  .  
 yes   _comma_   but you might have told me before  .  
 i didn t think you would be interested  .  
 you can t be serious  .  how dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? 
 sorry   _comma_   i didn t think it mattered  .  
 oh   _comma_   you men ! you are all the same  .  
how was the movie last night ? 
 i didn t really like it  .  
 mary said that she was really pleased with the photography  .  
 i found it very disappointing  .  
 she liked the acting    _comma_    too    _comma_    because that s what she wanted to see  .  
 i wasn t happy with it  .  
 nothing is to your satisfaction  .  
honey   _comma_   i ’ ll be right back ! 
 where are you going ? 
 i told you already ! i ’ m going to get my nails done  .  
 again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly   _comma_   why do you need a manicure every week ? 
 well     _comma_     first of all     _comma_     i like to pamper myself     _comma_     and my nails look great  .  you should come with me ! 
 why ? i don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! 
 they don ’ t only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles    _comma_    file my nails    _comma_    and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! 
 yeah   _comma_   sounds like something i should definitely do  .  
good afternoon ! 
 good afternoon ! sit down   _comma_   please . how are you ? 
 i m very well   _comma_   thank you . how are you ? 
 very well too   _comma_   thank you very much . isn   t it a lovely day ? 
 yes    _comma_    it s beautiful    _comma_    but it s also very hot  .  
 yes  .  
 what s the weather like in your country ? 
 mm  .  it s quite warm now  .  
 where do you live ? 
 in london . where do you live ? 
 here . near this school  .  
i ’ ve had it ! i ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! 
 so what are you gonna do ? just quit ? 
 that ’ s exactly what i am going to do ! i ’ ve decided to create my own company ! i ’ m going to write up a business plan   _comma_   get some investors and start working for myself ! 
 have you ever written up a business plan before ? 
 well       _comma_       no       _comma_       it can ’ t be that hard ! i mean       _comma_       all you have to do is explain your business       _comma_       how you are going to do things and that ’ s it       _comma_       right ? 
 you couldn ’ t be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less  .  then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has    _comma_    history    _comma_    etc  .  
 well   _comma_   that seems easy enough  .  
 wait     _comma_     there ’ s more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services  .  what they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? then comes the hard part     _comma_     a market analysis  .  you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per capita to how many children on average the population has ! all this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage     _comma_     where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea  .  
 geez  .  is that all ? 
 almost     _comma_     the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis  .  here you will calculate and estimate sales     _comma_     cash flow and profits  .  after all     _comma_     people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! 
 umm  .  i think i ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! 
i hear that mary got mad  .  
 so i heard  .  
 what ’ s wrong with her ? 
 she went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident  .  
um   _comma_   what will you do this weekend ? 
 how about a movie ? we haven t done that for a while  .  
 a movie ? sure  .  do you know what s on right now ? 
 no  .  why don t you check out the newspaper ? 
 ok  .  maybe you should invite your sister along   _comma_   too  .  
what ’ s on tv tonight ? 
 not much      _comma_      that new reality tv show      _comma_      ally mcneal      _comma_      oooo      _comma_      dark angel  .  
 wait a second  .  i want to watch ally mcneal  .  
 oh   _comma_   come on  .  that ’ s such a girl ’ s show  .  
 no it ’ s not  .  it ’ s just funny  .  
 yeah   _comma_   if you ’ re a girl  .  
 well   _comma_   you just want to watch dark angel because of the hot girl  .  
 that ’ s not true  .  dark angel is a good show  .  
 it ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits  .  
 o  .  k  .    _comma_   o  .  k  .  let ’ s forget it  .  there ’ s a football game on too  .  
 no way  .  i ’ m watching ally mcneal  .  go to john ’ s to watch the game  .  
it ’ s really terrible ! 
 what are you talking about ? 
 don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children  .  but the children are not interested in it at all  .  
 you said it  .  many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children  .  
sarah   _comma_   what did you do today ? 
 i went shopping  .  
 did you buy anything ? 
 yes   _comma_   i bought a few things  .  
 what did you buy ? 
 i bought this coat  .  do you like it ? 
 yeah   _comma_   i like it a lot  .  it s very pretty  .  where did you buy it ? 
 at the mall on  th street  .  
 was it expensive ? 
 no   _comma_   it wasn t expensive  .  it was on sale for    dollars  .  
 that s cheap  .  
 i know  .  it was a really good deal  .  
 i don t think you ll need to wear it for a while  .  it s been really hot lately  .  
hi   _comma_   victor  .  how are you ? 
 oh   _comma_   i m fine  .  
 so   _comma_   are you going to go to class tonight ? 
 maybe  .  but i don t think so  .  
 really ? what s the matter ? 
 i don t know  .  i m just feeling a little sad  .  
 listen  .  come with me to class   _comma_   and after class we can go out for dinner  .  
 now that s a good idea  .  thanks a lot   _comma_   brian  .  i m feeling better already  .  
how s john doing ? 
 he can barely make ends meet  .  
the phoenix team overpowered its counterpart    to     .  
 they re absolutely right to get a replacement for     .  
 if the phoenix beats the rocket   _comma_   it will enter the final  .  
 no way   _comma_   if it still has     .  
what s that book you have under your arm ? 
 it s the best seller everyone s been talking about for the last six months  .  
 how in the world did you get a copy ? i ve put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i m still waiting my turn  .  
 i checked it out of the rental library  .  it only costs five cents a day  .  
 is it really worth paying for ? 
 i can t tell yet  .  i haven t got beyond the first chapter  .  
 if it s any good   _comma_   i ll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition  .  
come on   _comma_   you are left behind ! 
 wow    _comma_    i can t catch my breath  .  you are running too fast    _comma_    honey  .  
 you just need more exercise  .  
 yes    _comma_    but you need to slow down  .  this is jogging    _comma_    not racing ! 
 i don t care  .  i want to burn up my fat  .  
 but running so fast is not good for people over forties  .  
 why ? 
 we are not as athletic as we were when young  .  mild exercise is more suitable for us  .  
 but i want to burn up more calories ! 
 in fact    _comma_    in order to burn up your fat    _comma_    you must take it slowly for a longer time  .  
 really ? i will slow down then  .  
hello    _comma_    daisy    _comma_    how are you doing ? 
 fine   _comma_   thank you  .  i haven ’ t seen you for quite some time  .  what have you been up to recently ? 
 i have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home    _comma_    so you wouldn t have seen me  .  recently    _comma_    i ve been obsessed with horror films  .  
 oh   _comma_   how can you be infatuated with horror films ? they re so scary  .  
 yeah     _comma_     you are right i used to not watch horror films     _comma_     but after seeing silence of the lamb with mike last month     _comma_     i fell in love with them  .  
 it s amazing  .  but if i were you   _comma_   i wouldn t have the courage to watch the first one  .  
 but it s really exciting  .  
 maybe     _comma_     but i would rather watch romance     _comma_     science fiction     _comma_     crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture  .  i wouldn t dare sleep at night after watching one  .  
 basically  .  you ll watch any type of movie except horror  .  
 yep  .  
 i think you should have a try someday  .  maybe you ll change your mind  .  
 maybe  .  after all   _comma_   i am grown up now  .  
it s hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy s headed  .  the trade deficit is getting larger    _comma_    consumption s down    _comma_    i really think we re headed for a recession  .  
 the economy has been stagnant for a while now  .  we ve been in a recessive state for several months already  .  what worries me the most is the trade deficit  .  i think the government should do more to encourage exports  .  
 increasing exports would weaken the currency  .  i think the main point is economic growth  .  we need more jobs  .  factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries  .  the result is an increase in unemployment in our own country      _comma_      lower consumption      _comma_      lower production      _comma_      and an overall feeble economy  .  if more people are working      _comma_      it will give the economy a boost  .  
 it s true that we should do something about unemployment     _comma_     but what about inflation ? if unemployment falls     _comma_     there s pressure to increase pay  .  that would result in inflation     _comma_     which would result in a much less dynamic economy  .  
are you an art aficionado ? 
 not really  .  i like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year  .  i hardly know anything about art or sculpture  .  you are a true art lover   _comma_   aren ’ t you ? 
 i love going to art galleries   _comma_   particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art  .  
 i never understand the meaning of those painting  .  they are too abstract for me  .  i didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school  .  
 art isn ’ t for everyone  .  i ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery  .  it ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture  .  
 i like sculpture   _comma_   especially that from ancient rome or greece  .  what time are you thinking of going ? i ’ d love to go with you  .  
 i thought i ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards  .  does that sound ok to you ? bus    goes directly there  .  
 that sounds fine  .  what time shall we meet at the bus stop ? 
 let ’ s meet at    thirty  .  it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits  .  
what does your mother do   _comma_   may i ask ? 
 my mother works in a company as an accountant  .  
 is she busy ? 
 not always   _comma_   she s rather busy at the end of the year  .  
hello   _comma_   bessie  .  
 hello   _comma_   jack . happy birthday ! 
 my birthday ? i forgot it   _comma_   thank you for remembering my birthday  .  
 i d like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness   _comma_   good health and continued success  .  i ve asked the fairy flowers to send you a bunch of flowers  .  i hope you ll like them  .  
 thanks a lot  .  i m so touched  .  
 now let me sing   happy birthday   for you  .  
 thank you very much  .  
nice day   _comma_   isn t it ? 
 it sure is  .  
 it s a good day for a picnic  .  
why don t you sit down and relax   _comma_   darling ? 
 i don t want to  .  
 well   _comma_   come over and talk to me then  .  
 certainly not  .  
 may i turn on the tv then ? 
 turn on the tv for what ? 
 so that we can sit down together and listen to some music  .  
 listen to the music ? and who will cook dinner   _comma_   will you ? 
 i will   _comma_   but let s go to the disco after dinner  .  
 to a disco ? oh   _comma_   no  .  you know i hate it  .  
diane grant ? i haven t seen you for ages ! 
 brian ! how have you been ? 
 pretty good  .  say   _comma_   you ve really changed ! 
 oh    _comma_    well    _comma_    i ve lost some weight  .  and my hair is longer than before  .  
 well   _comma_   you look great ! how are you ? 
 i m doing really well  .  i got married about three years ago  .  i have two kids now  .  
 that s terrific ! 
how is your new dormitory ? 
 it s very nice  .  there are only four people   _comma_   and those girls are very kind and friendly  .  
 well   _comma_   do you all major in the same subject ? 
 no    _comma_    the other three girls major in a computer science    _comma_    and they can help me a lot with the computer operating  .  
 that s great ! 
peter   _comma_   how often do you exercise ? 
 well   _comma_   i swim and run every day  .  
 now    _comma_    tell me    _comma_    what do you eat ? 
 well    _comma_    i don t eat any meat    _comma_    but i do eat fish and eggs  .  
 do you eat a lot of vegetables ? 
 oh yes    _comma_    and fruit    _comma_    i love fruit  .  
 what do you drink ? 
 well    _comma_    i never drink alcohol    _comma_    coffee or tea  .  they are very bad for you  .  
what ’ s the mountaineering club doing this weekend ? 
 we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river  .  
 how hard is the climb ? 
 it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet  .  
 what did you do last week ? 
 we rappelled down the side of       foot cliff  .  it was very exciting  .  
 wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun  .  i ’ m sorry i missed it  .  
 well   _comma_   you should come this weekend  .  i think you could do the climb  .  
 yeah   _comma_   i will  .  see you then ! 
 o  .  k  .  see you  .  
how many languages can you speak ? 
 i can speak french and german  .  
 how well can you speak them ? 
 i can speak german quite well   _comma_   but i can t speak french very well  .  
 can you help me to translate these sentences into german now ? 
 no   _comma_   but i ll be able to tomorrow  .  
gross ! what are you doing to yourself ? 
 chill ! i m just curling my eyelashes  .  
 it looks like some kind of primitive form of torture  .  
 you re such a wimp ! you re afraid of an eyelash curler  .  
 well   _comma_   you might pinch your eyelid ! or lose an eyeball ! 
 it just makes my eyelashes curl upwards  .  
do you really have to work today ? 
 yes  .  i m afraid so  .  
 but you ll miss out on the football game  .  
 oh  .  well   _comma_   it can t be helped  .  
how smart of you to book the tickets before hand ! 
 oh   _comma_   do you really think so ? 
 of course   _comma_   otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours  .  
 but i just got a call from my sister and i have to cancel the movie tonight  .  
i had an accident  .  
 that s terrible ! 
i found a new job after all   _comma_   and i like this one even better than the last  .  
 you see ? every cloud has a silver lining  .  
tom   _comma_   i won first prize in the poetry contest  .  
 come on ! you re pulling my leg  .  
 really ! here s my trophy  .  
 wow ! congratulations ! 
what a beautiful watch  .  it goes very well with your ring  .  
 thank you  .  
 is that your wedding ring ? 
 i m not married yet  .  it s my engagement ring  .  
 well   _comma_   congratulations  .  when is the big date ? 
 in june  .  
 did you have the watch before getting the ring ? 
 actually   _comma_   we bought the ring together after i got the watch  .  
 you did a fabulous job with the selection  .  it s gorgeous  .  
 thank you so much  .  
 what kind of watch is it ? 
 it s a tag heer  .  
 if you don t mind me asking   _comma_   how much do they cost ? 
 this one is         .  but they range from       to         .  
 that s why it looks so nice  .  i should have figured  .  you always get what you pay for  .  
 yeah  .  i would rather get one nice watch instead of    mediocre ones  .  
i m really mad at bob  .  
 what for ? ( why ? ) 
hi    _comma_    jack    _comma_    how have you been ? 
 not very well  .  
 why ? looks like you re feeling very down ! what happened ? 
 nothing  .  
 come on  .  for a man who s feeling so      _comma_      down      _comma_      there re usually two reasons  .  either his career is going downhill      _comma_      or he has a broken heart  .  since you re so successful      _comma_      it must be the latter  .  
 well   _comma_   you re right  .  i just broke up with jane  .  
 oh   _comma_   i m sorry  .  i thought you two were made for each ocher  .  
 well    _comma_    you never know  .  i m ready for a commitment and want to settle down    _comma_    but she says she wants to pursue her career while she s still young  .  
 well   _comma_   she is not to blame  .  it s always difficult to choose between career and family  .  
 maybe you re right  .  
 jack     _comma_     i don t know what to say to comfort you     _comma_     but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you ll find your soul mate     _comma_     your perfect match ! 
 yeah    _comma_    but it s hard to forget her at moment  .  you know    _comma_    we were together for almost five years  .  it s really hard  .  
do you know sally ? 
 sally  .  she is a bachelor girl  .  she is an excellent designer  .  many of the company s advertisements are her child trains  .  
 why is she still single ? she must have a face that would stop clock  .  
 oh   _comma_   quite the other way round  .  she is a knock out  .  she devotes much of her time to her career  .  
excuse me  .  do you have the time ? 
 my watch is a few minutes fast  .  it s about six forty   _comma_   i think  .  
 is it ? oh   _comma_   no  .  the concert will begin in twenty minutes  .  are we too late to get there ? 
 if we start now   _comma_   we can make it by taxi  .  
did you watch the volleyball match last night ? 
 yeah  .  
 who won ? 
 china  .  
 what is the score ? 
 china beat brazil three to zero  .  
 wonderful  .  
what do you mean ? if he was a good programmer   _comma_   he should have been raking it in  .  
 the boss wanted to pay bob with stock options  .  but bob didn t want to play that game again  .  
 again ? 
 at his last start up   _comma_   bob worked for stock and no salary  .  they folded and he made zip  .  
 ouch  .  
 now he only works freelance  .  hundred bucks an hour  .  
you mustn t touch the wet paint   _comma_   bill  .  
 i m sorry  .  i won t do it again  .  
 try to be more careful in future  .  look ! you ve damaged the sign  .  
 is this the sign ? what does it says ? 
 it says no smoking here  .  
good morning  .  i ’ m from the new york book review  .  could i ask you some questions about your latest book ? 
 sure  .  take a seat  .  what would you like to know ? 
 first   _comma_   i ’ ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story  .  
 that ’ s correct  .  it ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago  .  the main character the police invesigator is based on the man who investigated the case  .  
 how do you research your books ? 
 i always visit the places that i use as setting for stories  .  readers like things to be as factually correct as possible even in fiction ! i usually base my characters on people i have met  .  most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people  .  
 i really like your books  .  i ’ ve just finished this one  .  i read it from cover to cover in a single day  .  congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! 
 thank you  .  let met sign it for you  .  there you go  .  
 oh ! thank you very much  .  i heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories  .  what are the stories about ? 
 there ’ s a real mix of stories in the book  .  i haven ’ t finished all of them yet     _comma_     though  .  many of them are short detective stories     _comma_     but there are also horror stories and sci fi ones  .  if you give me your business card     _comma_     i ’ ll make sure you get an advance copy to review  .  
 thanks very much  .  i ’ m sure it will sell well  .  i can ’ t wait to read it  .  here ’ s my card  .  thank you for you time  .  
what shall i call him ? 
 oh    _comma_    you may call him uncle    _comma_    or henry  .  
 what s he doing ? 
 he s checking bags . he   s an official in the customs  .  
for the    th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party  .  
 that s a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library ! 
 i hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas  .  
 that is right up my alley  .  you say party and i m there  .  
 perfect  .  it will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people  .  
 will it be an all day event ? 
 yes  .  and we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library  .  
 that was quick thinking  .  
i m so glad i bought this watch ! 
 cool ! flashy red lines ! 
 i think this is the coolest watch i ve ever owned  .  
 is it waterproof ? 
 isn t that a silly question ? you know how much of an athlete i am  .  
 uh   _comma_   huh  .  so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ? 
 well    _comma_    surfing    _comma_    scuba diving  .  
do you take a bus to and from work ? 
 yeah   _comma_   everyday  .  and there ’ s only one choice  .  all the other buses are going the other direction  .  
 hmm  .  i have the same problem  .  when i leave work   _comma_   it ’ s always rush hour  .  so the buses are always crowded  .  
 oh     _comma_     yeah     _comma_     it ’ s terrible  .  i will tell you the funniest thing i have seen in china  .  it ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus     _comma_     and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt  .  
 that sounds terrible the way you describe it  .  but you know   _comma_   not long ago i really suffered on the bus  .  
 what happened ? were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? 
 you just can ’ t imagine ! i waited for the first bus but it was too full     _comma_     so i waited for the second     _comma_     and it was still very crowded  .  then i decided not to wait for the next one     _comma_     and got on the second bus  .  it was so full that i had to stand on one foot ! no kidding ! 
 hmm  .  good exercise   _comma_   uh ? 
 yeah   _comma_   absolutely ! 
 and it ’ s so much fun  .  one day   _comma_   the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front  .  i was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her  .  
 you were so happy   _comma_   weren ’ t you ? 
 what do you think ? i ’ m a good boy  .  
we are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center  .  
 that s great  .  
 now let s get things ready  .  
 don t worry  .  there are all kinds of things in the center  .  
 that s much more convenient  .  we don t even have to bring the flavorings  .  
look ! mom   _comma_   that s amazing ! i can t believe the girls have so neat movements  .  
 yeah   _comma_   they all received very strict training  .  a minute on the stage takes ten year practice  .  
 and all their movements are so elegant  .  it seems like dancing in the water  .  
 exactly     _comma_     you know     _comma_     water ballet puts dancing     _comma_     music and swimming together  .  
 there you go ! daddy has told me that water ballet is also called synchronized swimming  .  
 that s my boy ! katherine curtis created this activity in       .  and in        _comma_   it was authorized as one activity in olympic games  .  
 wow   _comma_   mom is more knowledgeable than dad  .  i must learn from you  .  
 my little boy   _comma_   you should learn more from me  .  i m almost thirty years older than you  .  
 ok     _comma_     you re the boss  .  look     _comma_     mom     _comma_     one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool  .  
 oh   _comma_   my god  .  it s so dangerous  .  and he might break his leg  .  you mustn t do anything like that  .  
it seems that nobody in your class likes paul  .  
 the boy is good for nothing  .  
 as a teacher   _comma_   i don ’ t know how to help him  .  
 he is hopeless  .  
hey rachael   _comma_   what s up ? how is your day ? 
 not bad . we have had a big meeting today   _comma_   remember ? 
 oh   _comma_   yea  .  i forgot . so how did it go ? 
 pretty well  .  i think the boss liked my ideas  .  
 great   _comma_   so what happens now ? 
 well   _comma_   i have to write the proposal  .  i m pretty excited about it  .  
do you believe in ufos ? 
 of course   _comma_   they are out there  .  
 but i never saw them  .  
 are you stupid ? they are called ufos   _comma_   so not everybody can see them  .  
 you mean that you can them  .  
 that s right  .  i can see them in my dreams  .  
 they come to the earth ? 
 no  .  their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space  .  
 aliens from the outer space ? do you talk to them ? what do they look like ? 
 ok      _comma_      ok      _comma_      one by one      _comma_      please ! they look like robots      _comma_      but they can speak  .  their mission is to make friends with human beings  .  
 that means that you talk to them ? in which language ? 
 of course in english   _comma_   they learn english on mars too  .  
 wow  .  sounds fantastic ! 
you look so happy   _comma_   anna  .  any good news ?

 have you just been to the cinema ? 
 yes   _comma_   i have  .  
 what ’ s on ? 
 paris in the spring  .  
 oh    _comma_    i ’ ve already seen it  .  i saw it on television last year  .  it ’ s an old film    _comma_    but it ’ s very good  .  
 paris is a beautiful city  .  i have never been there  .  have you ever been there   _comma_   ken ? 
 yes   _comma_   i have  .  i was there in april  .  
 paris in the spring   _comma_   eh ? 
 it was spring   _comma_   but the weather was awful  .  it rained all the time  .  
 just like dear old london ! 
they got a divorce at last  .  
 it s inevitable  .  their love wasbuilt on the sand   _comma_   and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks  .  
 you said it  .  love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks  .  
 that give us a good lesson  .  
where are you going ? 
 i ll accompany my wife to the hospital  .  
 what s wrong with her  .  
 she is expecting  .  
 congratulations to you  .  
 thank you  .  
i can ’ t stand being with you anymore  .  i m sick of your drinking  .  
 i swear never to drink again  .  just give me another chance   _comma_   please ! 
 how many chances have i given you ? i don ’ t trust you any more  .  
 you know how hard i ve tried to give up drinking ? i ’ d be lost without you  .  i won ’ t let you go anyway  .  
are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? 
 there are a few stories about natural disasters  .  there is a massive forest fire in australia  .  it covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers  .  
 was it caused accidentally or naturally ? sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in australia and africa  .  
 nobody knows at the moment   _comma_   but it has been very hot there recently  .  the drought in africa is causing starvation  .  millions of people have migrated to try and find food  .  
 what is the international community doing to help ? 
 the european union has sent several plants with relief supplies  .  several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies  .  refugee camps have been set up across the region  .  
 how many countries have been affected ? 
 six have been seriously affected   _comma_   but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries  .  
 i saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran  .  
 yes  .  there have been a few there recently  .  they say that this one was not a big quake  .  the iranians are dealing with it on their own  .  they have purchased some special equipment to find people buried u 
 does the newspaper say anything about casualties ? 
 so far    _comma_    less than    people have died    _comma_    but over     are in hospital  .  
is this a photo of your family ? 
 yes   _comma_   it is . it was taken just before i was leaving for college  .  
 you look so lovely  .  
 how time flies ! i ll not see twenty again  .  
i heard you ve found a new job  .  
 yes   _comma_   i m now working in a company  .  
 so you re quite happy with your new job ? 
 right  .  i enjoy what i m doing  .  
would you come to spend the weekend with us ? 
 oh   _comma_   i ’ m afraid i can ’ t  .  i ’ ve had a date already  .  
 that ’ s too bad  .  
 may be some other time  .  
you received a letter in the mail  .  
 give it here  .  
 who ’ s the letter from ? 
 i think it ’ s my acceptance letter from nyu  .  
 i want to know what it says  .  
 they didn ’ t accept me  .  
 are you serious ? 
 it ’ s the truth  .  
 are you okay ? 
 i really wanted to get into nyu  .  
 i am really sorry to hear that  .  
 it ’ s okay  .  i ’ m still waiting to hear from ucla anyway  .  
why are you so quiet ? 
 my girlfriend just broke up with me  .  
 you must feel terrible now  .  
 yeah  .  
 i remember my first break up  .  it was the worst feeling in the world  .  i was crying everyday for three months  .  and slowly   _comma_   it got better  .  i know you ll feel better too  .  
 you ve been through this too ? 
 yeah  .  i remember it very clearly  .  the pain makes it easy to remember  .  i know you re really hurting right now   _comma_   but you know many people experience break ups  .  
 but it hurts too much  .  
 i know it s painful    _comma_    but it s only temporary  .  after the pain goes away    _comma_    you ll find other girls  .  
 what if i don t want to find another girl ? 
 you ll change your mind  .  look at everyone in the world  .  they all break up and move on  .  the faster you understand this   _comma_   the quicker you will recover  .  
 you re right  .  
 i also know you must still have strong feelings for her   _comma_   but try to think of all the bad things  .  you know she didn t treat you that well  .  is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ? 
 yeah  .  thanks for the talk  .  
 i ll give you a call later  .  we should hang out  .  it s good to be around people  .  
 ok  .  i ll talk to you later  .  
excuse me   _comma_   what do you want for this bag ? 
 let me see  .  the one goes for       .  
 would you take      ? 
 no   _comma_   i can ’ t let you have it for    . how about    ? 
    .    ? 
 sorry   _comma_        is the lowest i can go  .  
i ’ m afraid i spoke in all of the table clock  .  
 never mind about that  .  
 i ’ m terribly sorry   _comma_   won ’ t you let me pay for ? 
 no   _comma_   i won ’ t hear of it  .  
a :: mr clinton   _comma_   it s nice to see you again  .  
 nice to see you again   _comma_   too  .  peter  .  how s your family ? 
 a :: very well  .  how s mrs clinton ? 
 not bad   _comma_   but she s as busy as before  .  
whatever we do   _comma_   we should do it above board  .  
 you are right  .  we shouldn t do anything under the table  .  
 well    _comma_    since you agree with me    _comma_    we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels  .  
morning   _comma_   zina  .  just wanted to say thanks again ! 
 hi   _comma_   vince  .  thanks for stopping by  .  how s the work coming along for the online auction ? 
 oh   _comma_   yeah  .  i m glad you mentioned that  .  i think we need to hire somebody new to manage it  .  
 can t elvin handle it ? 
 i think he s got too much on his plate  .  
this is the best dinner i ve ever had  .  
 how about the soup ? 
 i ve never tasted anything better  .  
 how nice of you to say so  .  
hey nick   _comma_   what are you up to ? 
 not much   _comma_   just heading over to the shooting range  .  you wanna come ? 
 seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i don ’ t know man  .  
 yeah   _comma_   it will be fun ! i have a  mm pistol that is really easy to shoot  .  i also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim  .  
 yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower ! 
 whoa      _comma_      take it easy there rambo  .  don ’ t get carried away  .  these weapons are not toys      _comma_      and you must first learn how to handle them properly  .  there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe  .  for example      _comma_      never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself  .  always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber      _comma_      and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot ! 
 wow   _comma_   i didn ’ t know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! 
 the reality is different you know   _comma_   running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ? 
 let ’ s do it ! 
hi   _comma_   jim  .  how are you ? i haven ’ t seen you for a while  .  
 i ’ m fine  .  i ’ ve been out of town  .  i just got back  .  
 where were you ? 
 i was in new york for a wedding  .  
broadway mall is having a big sale this weekend  .  you wanna go ? 
 don t feel like it  .  i m broke  .  
 well    _comma_    we can still do some window shopping    _comma_    can t we ? 
 just look around ? ah   _comma_   that s boring  .  
 i ll go myself then  .  
what s the problem   _comma_   nada ? you look down in the dumps  .  
 i don t know  .  my life is a big mess  .  everything is so complicated  .  
 come on   _comma_   nothing can be that bad  .  
 but promise me   _comma_   you ll keep it a secret  .  
 ok   _comma_   i promise  .  so what s troubling you so much ? 
 i ve fallen in love with my boss  .  
 really ? is he married ? 
 no   _comma_   of course not  .  he is still single  .  
 then what s your problem ? 
 i try to keep it to myself  .  but there is a lot of gossip about us  .  
 oh   _comma_   i see  .  office romance tends to be the subject of gossip  .  
 worse still   _comma_   he is trying to avoid me these days  .  
 office romance is very tricky  .  
 it gives me a lot of pressure and i feel depressed  .  
 cheer up   _comma_   nada  .  you ll be fine  .  
you re not looking happy  .  what s the matter ? 
 oh   _comma_   nothing special  .  i m just a bit tired  .  
 with the job ? 
 with everything    _comma_    with everybody    _comma_    with all this ! 
 a good suggestion for you  .  you need a holiday  .  
 it wasn t always like this   _comma_   you know  .  
 what do you mean ? 
 well   _comma_   i mean  .  we always do the same thing  .  there s no variety in our lives  .  
 you need a holiday  .  that s what s the matter  .  
 certainly   _comma_   perhaps  .  
i wonder what he looks like  .  oh    _comma_    i can t wait to see him ! his email said he d be wearing a white hat  .  ( looking around for him ) oh    _comma_    there is  .  
 hey   _comma_   isabelle  .  
 logan ! why on earth are you hiding here ? white hat ! come on ! don t tell me you re the guy ! it can t be true  .  
 yes   _comma_   i am the guy  .  
 what a bummer ! you set me up ? 
 let me explain  .  i didn t mean to hurt you  .  
 how dare you ! ( starts to walk off ) 
 hang on one second  .  hear me out    _comma_    just this once    _comma_    isabella ! 
 why did you lie to me in the email ? 
 i didn t lie  .  you just didn t ask me my real name  .  
 i should have known it was you  .  no wonder all the    questions were answered correctly  .  i thought i might have found the one for me  .  
 i m sorry  .  it was cruel of me  .  but i promise it will never happen again ? look   _comma_   there s a nice restaurant  .  let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over  .  
peter   _comma_   how often do you exercise ? 
 well   _comma_   i swim and run every day  .  
 now    _comma_    tell me    _comma_    what do you eat ? 
 well    _comma_    i don t eat any meat    _comma_    but i do eat fish and eggs  .  
 do you eat a lot of vegetables ? 
 oh yes    _comma_    and fruit    _comma_    i love fruit  .  
 what do you drink ? 
 well    _comma_    i never drink alcohol    _comma_    coffee or tea  .  they are very bad for you  .  
 what do you drink ? 
did you watch the volleyball match last night ? 
 yeah  .  
 who won ? 
 china  .  
 what was the score ? 
 china beat brazil   to    .  
 wonderful ! 
even if our company didn t have a dress code   _comma_   i still think people would wear formal clothing to work  .  
 i wouldn t be so sure  .  people want to wear what they feel most comfortable in  .  
 maybe that s true for some positions   _comma_   but i think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree  .  they dress for success ! you can t go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans  .  it s just not respectful to you client  .  
 i think what you wear is so overrated  .  i would rather have a down to earth     _comma_     honest and solid sales person than a painted     _comma_     patent leather     _comma_     designer suite salesman  .  
 it s not as simple as that  .  people judge you by your appearance   _comma_   whether you like it or not  .  so dressing professional is being professional  .  the image that you portray to others is so important in business  .  it s your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale  .  
 maybe you re right   _comma_   but i ll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! 
isn t it wonderful walking here ? 
 what do you mean ? 
 i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us  .  
 yes   _comma_   look over there  .  that s the empire state building  .  my book says it s     stories tall  .  
 it s quite famous but don t you think it looks a bit old fashioned ? 
 you re right   _comma_   but when it was built in      it was a marvel of technology and engineering  .  
 what other important buildings are we going to see on fifth avenue ? 
 quite a number  .  actually every skyscraper has a history  .  a few blocks ahead we ll see st . patrick   s cathedral and just across the street will be the world renowed rockefeller center  .  it s a landmark in the history of architecture  .  
 what s there after that ? 
 well then   _comma_   there s a central park  .  facing the park on fifth avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world  .  
 what are they all for ? 
 most of them are office buildings    _comma_    huge department stores    _comma_    and hotels but some are just private homes  .  new york is one of the financial centers of the world  .  and there are lots of very expensive places  .  
hey kevin   _comma_   what are you doing here ? don t you usually spend tuesday nights at home studying ? 
 i needed to get out of the house  .  my parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them  .  
 what did she tell them ? is she dropping out of college ? 
 nothing that serious  .  she finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend  .  
 and your parents took it badly ? 
 that s putting it mildly  .  my father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her  .  
 ouch   _comma_   that sounds bad  .  what did your sister do ? 
 she started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend     _comma_     how they re in love and it s not hurting anybody     _comma_     and so on  .  my dad said she s too young to do this     _comma_     and that she should move out right away  .  
 how long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? 
 three years  .  they ve been dating since freshman year  .  they re even talking about marriage  .  
 really ? then i guess living together would be a good idea  .  
 what do you mean ? 
 well    _comma_    these days too many people are getting divorced  .  if they live together    _comma_    then at least they re finding out if they re really compatible or not  .  
 i guess so  .  better to find out now than after you re married   _comma_   when it s harder to get out  .  
do you think they two will get married ? 
 yeah   _comma_   you can count on it  .  
 i think so  .  yes   _comma_   they get along so well  .  
 i like him  .  he s good for her  .  
 you re right  .  he sure is  .  
what do you think of frank ? 
 he is all right  .  but i think he seems to have no back bone  .  
 why do you say that ? 
 whatever things get tough   _comma_   he gives in  .  
uh oh  .  we don t have a flashlight  .  
 don t worry  .  we ll make it back to the camp site before dark  .  
 i sure hope so  .  
do you speak only english in the class   _comma_   or does your teacher explain everything to you in spanish ? 
 oh   _comma_   we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english  .  
 i suppose she s right  .  does she speak english very slowly ? 
 not always  .  sometimes we don t understand her  .  then she has to repeat what she said  .  
 it must be interesting to study english  .  
 mario and i are the best students in the class  .  miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good  .  
 is english pronunciation easy or difficult ? 
 sometimes it s difficult  .  some words look different from the way one pronounces them  .  
it s quiet everywhere in winter  .  
 yes  .  i like winter  .  
 me too  .  
 it s snowing heavily  .  what about taking a walk ? 
 that s a good idea  .  let s go ! 
 what a heavy snow ! look ! the water is frozen  .  
 take care ! don t slip on the ground  .  
 i ve got it  .  i like the feeling of stepping on the ice  .  
 yes  .  very wonderful  .  
 there is a snowman over there  .  
 how lovely it is ! 
tim s always bothering me  .  
 just tell him off  .  
who are those guys ? 
 kobe bryant and shaquille o ’ neal   _comma_   they are the los angeles lakers ’ star players  .  
 oh  .  
 wait a second  .  he shoots   _comma_   he scores ! 
 all right ! 
 here comes jordan   _comma_   though  .  
 wow   _comma_   michael jordan ’ s slam dunks are beautiful things to watch  .  
 yeah  .  he ’ s older     _comma_     so he doesn ’ t slam as much as he did when he was younger     _comma_     but when he does     _comma_     it ’ s still amazing  .  
 which team do you think will win ? 
 the lakers  .  jordan is the only good player washington has  .  
i am sorry to trouble you again   _comma_   mr . stone  .  
 it s ok  .  what do you want to ask ? 
 where should i go after i arrived at the university ? 
 the first place you should go is the international center  .  
 why ? 
 you can get help there in dealing with the united states immigration and naturalization service ; you can find foreign student advisers  .  
 what kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? 
 they ll discuss personal concerns     _comma_     housing     _comma_     adjustment     _comma_     finances and other matters with you  .  
 can we get any more help at the international center ? 
 yes    _comma_    a lot more  .  if you go there just before the beginning of the fall s semester    _comma_    you can get your student id and social security number there  .  they will keep your documents up to date  .  they will offer an orientation program for new comers  .  they will also help you contact your department and registration office  .  
 i see  .  it must be worth going to  .

hi   _comma_   lander  .  what s wrong ? 
 i can hardly make ends meet these days  .  
 same here  .  i have t brought any new clothes for three months  .  
 my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise  .  
 true  .  the news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities  .  
 definitely  .  i have to spend     yuan more on food every month  .  
 the biggest price jump is for pork   _comma_   so most people have to turn to chicken  .  
 is that inflation ? 
 inflation is more than just the rising prices   _comma_   i guess  .  but the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation  .  
 has the government taken some measures to curb it ? 
 yes  .  the government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy  .  
 but i m afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy  .  
 you said it  .  i think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending  .  
 how ? 
 for a start    _comma_    we can take the public transport to work  .  you know    _comma_    running a car is a big expense  .  
 sounds a good idea  .  
ok   _comma_   everyone  .  gather around  .  here are the rules  .  no tackling  .  no pushing  .  
 you shouldn t grab someone else s shirt  .  that s a foul  .  
 play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched  .  
 you can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees  .  
 the touchdown lines are there and there  .  ok   _comma_   let s play ! 
 before we start   _comma_   let s have a moment of silence for our fallen men  .  
have you adapted to the lifestyle in china ? 
 yeah   _comma_   almost  .  but there is one thing  .  
 what ? 
 i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people  .  i don t mean to say that there s no privacy in china   _comma_   but  .  
 what is it ? 
 some of my chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others  .  
 that makes you feel uncomfortable ? 
 yeah  .  we never do that in a public office  .  
 perhaps that s because we hold different ideas about privacy  .  
 i have felt that  .  one day when i was in a queue    _comma_    reading a newspaper story    _comma_    the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding  .  
 well   _comma_   that s not rare  .  i ve seen people reading at others   newspaper while taking a metro or a bus  .  
 just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? 
 yeah  .  
 oh   _comma_   i m shocked  .  
what courses did you take in college ? 
 i took a lot of courses       _comma_       such as philosophy       _comma_       logic       _comma_       ethics       _comma_       aesthetics       _comma_       etc  .  
 which course did you like best ? 
 i liked aesthetics best  .  it is very impressive  .  
hi  .  have you got a personal computer ? 
 certainly  .  what s the matter ? 
 i wonder if you often trade with others on the internet  .  
 sure  .  i often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores  .  
 great ! it s just like viewless stores  .  but how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ? 
 that s simple  .  just click the hyperlink     _comma_     www . taobao . com or www  .  ebay . com     _comma_     and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen     _comma_     and then you can place an order online with the sales company  .  and the goods will be delivered to your place  .  
 is the service charged ? 
 no  .  it s free  .

we are planning to go to beidaihe for vacation  .  do you want to go with us ?

 i ’ m afraid this seat is taken  .  
 oh  .  is it  .  thank you anyway  .  
 you ’ re welcome  .  why don ’ t you ask the conductor when he comes by ? 
 thank you  .  
i prefer potatoes to eggplants  .  
 i feel eggplants are more nutritious  .  
 but as a matter of fact   _comma_   potatoes taste better  .  
 oh   _comma_   that s how you see it  .  
are you sure you can t lend me five thousand dollars ? 
 hmm  .  i ll tell you what  .  i ll lend you four thousand dollars   _comma_   but you have to pay me back next week  .

every time when heroes came back from the battlefield   _comma_   we took our hats off to them  .  
 you were showing respect and admiration for them  .  
 i wish i were a hero  .  
frank ’ s getting married   _comma_   do you believe this ? 
 is he really ? 
 yes   _comma_   he is  .  he loves the girl very much  .  
 who is he marring ? 
 a girl he met on holiday in spain   _comma_   i think  .  
 have they set a date for the wedding ? 
 not yet  .  
ok  .  come back into the classroom   _comma_   class  .  
 does the class start again   _comma_   mam ?

jenny   _comma_   what s wrong with you ? why do you keep weeping like that ? 
 mary told me that she had seen you with john last night  .  i got to know the fact that you are playing the field  .  
 honey     _comma_     cross my heart     _comma_     i v never looked at another woman since the first day i set my eyes on you ! believe me     _comma_     that s the truth  .  
what a nice day ! 
 yes  .  how about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? 
 great   _comma_   let s go ! 
 hey    _comma_    darling    _comma_    i think i might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day  .  i was so relaxed  .  it felt as if i were in another world  .  
 exactly  .  you know     _comma_     the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon  .  you remember ? the island     _comma_     the sound of the waves     _comma_     the salty sea air and the sunshine  .  
 yes   _comma_   it was wonderful but it s already been a year  .  how time flies ! 
 why not go again to celebrate out one year anniversary ? we can go to the same beach   _comma_   stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant  .  
 are you kidding ? can you afford it ? do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
